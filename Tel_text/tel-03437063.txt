Abstract
  The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) belongs to the Alphavirus genus which can be found in an ecological
but not taxonomic group named arboviruses (for arthropod-borne viruses), indicating viruses
transmitted by an arthropod vector hematophagous to a vertebrate host, during a blood meal.
Alphaviruses are transmitted by bloodsucking arthropods, mainly mosquitoes, to humans and animals
causing debilitating disease. While in humans, CHIKV-associated disease is characterized by fever,
headache, and a typical acute infection, sometimes followed by persistent arthralgia or myalgia, the
infection does not seem to cause significant pathology in mosquitos. Since the re-emergency of CHIKV
at La Réunion in 2005-2006, the Alphavirus-host or vector interactions have been increasingly studied
at the cellular and molecular level. Indeed, the identification of cellular and viral factors involved in
human pathology and mosquito chronicity could lead to the development of antiviral treatments.
Regulated apoptotic cell death and interferon Type-I immune response are strong antiviral defences
participating in rapid viral elimination. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that p53 plays a central role
in the regulation of cell death and the Type-I interferon signalling pathway during different viral
infections. Finally, quite recently it has been suggested that in Dengue virus-infected insects, p53-
induced cell death was associated with the permissiveness and resistance of vectors. Consequently, my
work was to study the potential role of p53 and p53 isoforms on the cellular outcome and viral infection
in mammals and insects infected with Alphavirus, mainly the chikungunya virus and to a lesser extent
the Sindbis virus.


   First, in order to investigate a potential function of p53 in viral infection in mammals and insects
infected with chikungunya virus and Sindbis virus, we generated a p53 knockout human skeletal muscle
cell line. In addition, thanks to a collaboration, we obtained the Drosophila melanogaster p53-/- mutant
strain. We observed an opposite effect of p53 knockout on chikungunya virus infection in in vitro human
cells and in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster. Indeed, we demonstrated an increase in CHIKV infection in
p53 knockout human cells and a decrease in CHIKV and Sindbis virus replication in whole fly p53-/-
mutants. Several analyses of the CHIKV-infected p53 knockout human cell line demonstrated an immune
antiviral effect of p53 through the Type-I interferon production and signalling pathway and a negative
impact on the protection of neighbouring cells. Moreover, it seems that infected-p53 knockout cells are
not able to enhance IFN production and signalling. Further experiments are required to decipher the
activity of p53 on immune signalling. In parallel, we have shown that CHIKV-induced cell death was p53-
independent as no pro-apoptotic genes transcribed by p53 were regulated and the knockout of p53 did
not decrease or delay virus-induced cell death.


   Secondly, the p53 gene leads to several different protein isoforms which participate in p53 regulation
through transcriptional and translational regulatory mechanisms. The biological functions of p53 protein
isoforms are actively investigated in the field of cancerology. ∆133p53 is one of the most characterized
isoforms although the biological significance of ∆40p53 is not fully understood. In the context of
infection, it has been shown that ∆133p53 is modulated and impacts p53-dependent antiviral activity.
Thus, for my project we investigated a possible function of ∆40p53 and ∆133p53 isoforms in CHIKV
infection. We set up and produced (i) a human muscle cell line overexpressing endogenous ∆40p53 using
CRISPR/Cas9 technology; and (ii) an inducible-system overexpressing ∆40p53 and ∆133p53 protein
isoforms. We observed that endogenous overexpression of the ∆40p53 isoform led to a decrease in
CHIKV infection, but the mechanism remains unclear. In parallel, the inducible system for overexpression
of protein isoforms need to be improved in order to investigate the involvement of ∆40p53 and ∆133p53
protein isoforms in CHIKV infection.

Résumé
     Le virus du chikungunya (CHIKV) appartient au genre des Alphavirus qui peuvent faire partis d’un
groupe écologique mais pas taxonomique, nommé les Arbovirus (pour « Arthropod-borne viruses »)
signifiant des virus transmis par des arthropodes vecteurs hématophages à des hôtes vertébrés, au cours
d’un repas sanguin. Les alphavirus sont transmis, principalement par des moustiques, à l’Homme et aux
animaux causant des maladies invalidantes. Tandis que le CHIKV induit chez l’Homme une maladie
caractérisée par de la fièvre, des maux de tête et une infection aigue typique, elle peut s’accompagner
de douleurs articulaires et musculaires persistantes ; alors que chez le moustique l’infection ne semble
pas causer de pathologie. A la suite de la réémergence du CHIKV au cours de l’épidémie de 2005-2006 à
La Réunion, les interactions entre les alphavirus et leur hôte ou vecteur sont de plus en plus étudiées au
niveau cellulaire et moléculaire. En effet, l’identification de facteurs cellulaires et viraux impliqués dans
la pathologie de l’Homme et la chronicité du vecteur moustique permettrait de développer des
traitements antiviraux. La mort cellulaire programmée (apoptose) et la réponse immunitaire de Type-I
assurent une réponse antivirale rapide, participant à l’élimination du virus. De plus, il a été démontré
que la protéine p53 joue un rôle central dans la régulation de l’apoptose et dans la voie de signalisation
de la réponse interféron de Type-I. Pour finir, il a été suggéré récemment que l’infection d’un insecte
par le virus de la Dengue, la morte cellulaire induite par p53 était associée à la permissivité et à la
résistance du vecteur.
   L’objectif de mon travail était d’étudier le rôle possible de la protéine p53 et des isoformes p53 sur la
réponse cellulaire et l’infection virale chez le mammifère et l’insecte infectés par des alphavirus, en
prenant le virus du chikungunya comme modèle principal et dans une moindre mesure le virus Sindbis.
   Dans un premier temps, nous avons généré une lignée cellulaire de muscle squelettique humaine
délété de la protéine p53 et grâce à une collaboration, nous avons obtenu des souches Drosophila
melanogaster p53-/- mutantes. Nous avons observé un effet opposé de la délétion de p53 sur l’infection
du chikungunya entre la lignée cellulaire humaine et la drosophile. En effet, nous avons démontré que
la délétion de p53 induisait une augmentation de l’infection du CHIKV dans les cellules humaines et une
diminution de la réplication virale du CHIKV et du virus Sindbis chez les drosophiles. Plusieurs analyses
ont montré que la protéine p53 était impliquée dans la réponse interféron de Type-I, indépendamment
de son implication dans la régulation de la mort cellulaire au cours de l’infection du CHIKV dans les
cellules humaines. En effet, la délétion de p53 ne permet pas la production d’interféron Bêta et par
conséquence la production des gènes cibles de la voie de signalisation. L’activité de p53 sur la réponse
immune va être étudiée plus en détails dans des expériences futures. En parallèle, nous avons également
montré que la mort cellulaire induite par le virus CHIKV était indépendante de p53 car aucuns des gènes
cibles de p53 étudiés n’était régulés et la délétion de p53 n’a pas diminué ou retardé l’induction de la
mort cellulaire à la suite de l’infection virale.
   Dans un deuxième temps, le gène p53 conduit à l’expression de nombreuses isoformes qui participent
à la régulation de l’activité de p53. Les fonctions biologiques des isoformes p53 sont principalement
étudiées en cancérologie. Parmi elles, l’isoforme ∆133p53 est l’isoforme la plus caractérisée et à
l’inverse le rôle biologique de l’isoforme ∆40p53 n’est pas entièrement compris. Lors d’une infection par
le virus Influenza A, il a été montré que l’isoforme ∆133p53 est modulée et impacte l’activité antivirale
guidée par p53. Mon sujet de thèse a porté sur le rôle possible des isoformes ∆133p53 et ∆40p53 sur
l’infection du CHIKV. Pour cela nous avons mis au point (i) des cellules humaines de muscle qui
présentent une surexpression endogène de l’isoforme ∆40p53, générée par la technologie CRISPR/Cas9
et (ii) un système inductible pour surexprimer transitoirement les protéines des deux isoformes. Nous
avons observé que la surexpression endogène de l’isoforme ∆40p53 conduisait à une diminution de
l’infection, cependant le mécanisme est inconnu. En parallèle, le système inductible de surexpression
des isoformes doit être amélioré afin d’étudier le rôle possible des deux isoformes sur l’infection par le
CHIKV.

BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYNTHESIS

The bibliographic synthesis is divided into four chapters. The first one describes the family of
Alphavirus where it is introduced in the classification and affiliation of the arbovirus group. Also,
the viral replication of some alphaviruses is presented, comparing mammal and mosquito cells.
Chapter two describes in more detail the chikungunya virus: its discovery and transmission in
mammal hosts and the mosquito vector. Then, chapter three describes the comparative
immune and apoptotic cell response during alphavirus infection in mammals and insects.
Finally, chapter four explains the activity of the transcription factor p53 on cellular outcome
during non-arboviral and arboviral infections.

                       Taxonomy of Alphavirus


Regarding the Baltimore classification, the genus alphavirus belongs to the group IV with single-
stranded positive-sense RNA viruses ((+)ssRNA).
Alphaviruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus) include approximately 30 members. Among
the different species, some alphaviruses are pathogenic for humans with diseases ranging from
mild to severe. Historically, Alphaviruses were divided into New World (NW) and Old World
(OW) alphaviruses regarding their global distribution, evolution, pathogenicity, tissue and
cellular tropism or interactions with respective hosts. Old World alphaviruses (chikungunya
virus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, Ross River virus, etc.) are mainly found in Asia, Africa
and Europe and infections in vertebrate are characterized by rash, fever, arthralgia, and
myalgia. New World alphaviruses (Eastern-, Western-, Venezuelan-, Equine encephalitis
viruses, etc.) are found in North and South America and infections are characterized by
debilitating febrile disease and encephalitis (Figure 1).

Moreover, the genus Alphavirus was classified antigenically into seven complexes. Table 1
presents the seven complexes which are: Barmah Forest Complex, Ndumu Complex,
Middelburg Complex, Semliki Forest Complex, Western Equine Encephalitis Complex, Eastern
Equine Encephalitis Complex and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Complex. Finally, thanks to a
phylogenetic approach, the evolutionary history and mechanisms of emergence of alphaviruses
was conducted using part of the envelope glycoprotein (E1) sequence (Powers et al. 2001).

                      Arbovirus: an ecological group


Viruses belonging to Alphavirus genus can also be grouped in an ecological but not taxonomic
group called Arboviruses (an acronym for “arthropod-borne viruses”) indicated viruses
transmitted by an arthropod hematophagous vector to a vertebrate host during a blood meal.
Arboviruses comprise viruses of nine families, and nearly 600 arboviruses are known at present
and registered in this catalog https://wwwn.cdc.gov/arbocat/default.aspx by Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Around 50 to 100 of the arboviruses identified can cause
disease in vertebrates (humans, domestic animals, wild animals, and birds) and other
arboviruses can be exclusively pathogenic for human beings. The majority of arboviruses
causing severe morbidity and mortality in human beings around the world belong to
Togaviridae (alphavirus genus), Flaviviridae (flavivirus genus) families and to some Bunyavirales
families. They are mainly transmitted by Culicine mosquitoes, genera Aedes and Culex, with the
exception of the O’nyong-nyong virus (alphavirus) transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes,
genus Anopheles. Only the female mosquito acquires an arbovirus during a blood meal, which
is necessary for egg development.
Hematophagous arthropods include species of the class Insecta with numerous viruses
transmitted by the well-studied Aedes mosquito (class Insecta, order Diptera, family Culicidae,
tribe Aedini, genus Aedes) but also less well-studied insects like culicoids (class Insecta, order
Diptera, family Ceratopogonidae, subfamily Ceratopogoninae, tribe Culicoidini, genus
Culicoides) or biting midges and sandflies (class Insecta, order Diptera, family Psychodidae,
subfamily Phlebotominae, genus Phlebotomus) and also arthropods belonging to Arachnida
class like ticks (order Ixodida) and mites. Table 2 presents a non-exhaustive list of examples of
arboviruses and their principal vector and vertebrate host(s) (Table 2).

             Viral particle structure and genome organization


Alphaviruses are small, enveloped viruses about 70 nm in diameter, with an icosahedral shape.
The genome is approximately 11,800 nucleotides, constituting a positive-sense, single-strand
RNA ((+)ssRNA) with a 5’ 7-methylguanosine cap and a 3’ poly-A tail as well as 5’- and 3’-
untranslated regions (UTRs).
The (+)ssRNA contains two open reading frames (ORFs). The first one is flanked by the 5’ cap
and a UTR region for non-structural polyproteins and the non-coding junction region between
both ORFs contains the C-terminus region of the non-structural polyprotein (Figure 3). The
promoter of the 26S subgenomic mRNA along with the start site and untranslated region
allowing the transcription of the second ORF is present in the junction region. The second ORF
encodes structural proteins and present a 3’ UTR and a poly(A) tail (Strauss and Strauss 1994).
The 5’ and 3’ UTRs non-coding regions are involved in the regulation of viral gene expression
but also virus-host interactions that are associated with viral evolution, host range and
pathogenesis (Hyde et al. 2015).




                                                                                             24


The non-structural ORF encodes four essential nonstructural proteins (nsP1, 2, 3 and 4) and the
second one, the 3’ ORF, translated from the 26S subgenomic mRNA encodes five proteins
(capsid, E3, E2, 6K and E1), with three major structural proteins (capsid, E1 and E2).


The viral particle is composed of the lipid bilayer envelope associated with 240 copies of
nucleocapsid forming a solid shell that encapsidates genomic RNA. Inside the lipid bilayer
membrane, the E1 and E2 glycoproteins are arranged in heterodimer subunits which are then
combined into trimers forming the 80 spikes at the surface of the virion (Figure 3).


                      Non-structural proteins


The non-structural protein nsP1 (~60 kDa) presents a methyltransferase and guanylytransferase
activity necessary in the capping of virus mRNA. NsP1 is involved in the synthesis of 49S minus-
strand RNA. It can also interact with phospholipids of cellular membranes thanks to its
amphipathic loop and palmitoylation sites, which is important for the replication of
alphaviruses in a specific structure called replication complex (RC) anchored to the plasma
membrane (Bakar and Ng 2018).

The nsP2 (~90 kDa) is a multifunctional enzyme and regulatory protein. It presents an N-
terminal RNA helicase domain which can unwind double-strand RNA and an RNA 5-
Triphosphatase activity essential for mRNA capping. Finally, a C-terminal protease activity is
responsible for non-structural polyprotein processing. nsP2 also contains a Nuclear localization
signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES). During viral replication, nsP2 is involved in the
transcriptional shut-off of mammalian cells and in virus-associated cytotoxicity but not in the
vector (Akhrymuk, Kulemzin, and Frolova, 2012). These activities of nsP2 in mammals and
insects will be discussed in detail in chapter 3.

The nsP3 (~60 kDa) presents an ADP-ribose 1-phosphate phosphatase activity allowing protein
regulation and is involved in minus-strand and 26S subgenomic RNA synthesis. The protein
comprises three domains: an N-terminal macro-domain, a central zinc-binding domain and a
C-terminal hypervariable domain.




                                                                                              25


NsP4 (~ 70 kDa) is the core of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase allowing viral RNA
transcription, however all the nsPs are required and essential for RNA synthesis. NsP4 presents
a C-terminal Adenylyltransferase activity, which may allow the generation of the poly(A) tail at
the 3’ end (Pietilä, Hellström, and Ahola 2017).



                       Structural proteins


Thanks to four non-structural proteins, the five structural proteins are synthesized: the capsid,
E3, E2, 6K and E1. They are first synthesized as a structural polyprotein and then separated by
viral and cellular factors. The structural proteins are involved in virion binding and entry,
nucleocapsid assembly and virion budding from the plasma membrane.

The capsid (~ 30 kDa) presents an N-terminal RNA binding region allowing the encapsidation of
the viral genome and a C-terminal serine protease activity region which can cleave itself out of
the structural polyprotein (Hahn and Strauss 1990). The capsid also contains a nuclear
localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) at the end of the N-terminal region
and the beginning of C-terminal region, respectively (Thomas et al. 2013). Lastly, the
monomeric capsid will assemble to form the nucleocapsid of the viral particle by interaction
with viral RNA and glycoprotein E2.


The E2 glycoprotein (~ 40 kDa) presents glycosylation sites responsible for binding to the cell
and the E1 glycoprotein (~ 45 kDa) presents a fusion peptide involved in membrane fusion during
the entry of the viral particle. It is also responsible for the formation of the icosahedral shell.


6K is a small structural protein (6 kDa) presenting cysteine residues which seem important for
the formation of infectious particles and up to 30 copies of 6K are incorporated in the virus
particle (Melton et al. 2002). It has been shown that in mammalian cells, 6K can be associated
with membrane modification by forming a cation-selective channel leading to the permeability
of the membrane (Melton et al. 2002).


The E3 protein is also a small protein (~ 10 kDa) whose exact role is not yet well understood but
it has been hypothesized that E3 is involved in virus assembly and in infectious particle
                                                                                                  26


production. Recently, it has been shown that E3 can mediate a pH protection of E1 during virus
assembly (Uchime, Fields, and Kielian 2013).

C. The Alphavirus genome (+)ssRNA possesses a 5’ cap and a 3’ poly(A) tail and 5’ and 3’
untranslated regions (UTRs) surrounded by two open reading frames. The non-structural
proteins (nsP1-4) are translated from the 49S genomic RNA while the structural proteins
(Capsid, E3, E2, 6K and E1) are translated from subgenomic 26S RNA. In the early and late
process of non-structural protein synthesis, the polyprotein is cleaved by nsP2 and in the late
process of structural protein synthesis the polyprotein is cleaved by the viral capsid and host
proteases (furin, signal peptidase).




             Replicative cycle in mammals and mosquitos


This part will present the replicative cycle of alphavirus in mammal and mosquito cells. The
replicative cycle has been studied more in mammal cells. Indeed, only a few works present the
replicative cycle in mosquito cells and this part is mainly based on findings using the Sindbis
virus as an alphavirus species.




                                                                                            27


                      Binding and entry by endocytosis


Enveloped viruses use specific receptors and co-receptors to enter specific cells but also
attachment factors to promote binding at the cell surface. Alphaviruses then enter the cell
through the receptor-mediated endocytosis entry process.

Among the attachment factors, it has been shown that several alphaviruses can use
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to enter mammalian cells. GAGs are a family of highly sulfated linear
polysaccharides, ubiquitous at the cell surface and categorized into four groups: heparan sulfate
(HS), chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate and hyaluronan. Mammalian cell surface binding of
SINV, RRV, SFV, VEEV and EEEV has been shown to be dependent on heparan sulfate (Byrnes
and Griffin 1998; Gardner et al. 2013; Smit et al. 2002). DC-SIGN and L-SIGN, two
transmembrane C-type lectins, calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding proteins, have been
shown to be important in cell-adhesion and pathogen-recognition factors for the entry of
alphaviruses into mammalian cells (Klimstra et al. 2003).

Human T-cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin-domain (TIM) and TAM (Tyro3, Axl and Mer)
transmembrane receptors participate in the clearance of apoptotic cells by recognising
phosphatidylserine (PS) at the surface of dead cells. PS can be present at the surface of the viral
particle after budding at the PS positive-membrane and some viruses have evolved to exploit
and bind to TIM and TAM receptors to enter targets cells. Indeed, it has been shown that the
Dengue virus exploits TIM and TAM receptors for entry into cells, as do SINV and RRV and many
other enveloped viruses (Jemielity et al. 2013; Meertens et al. 2012). The role of PS in the viral
particle membrane will be discussed in more detail in chapter 3.

Compared to the entry process into mammalian cells, very few studies have been performed to
understand this process in the mosquito. In 2014, using virus overlay protein binding assays
(VOPBA) and mass spectroscopy, a study showed a 50 kDa protein attached to CHIKV and
identified as an ATP synthase beta subunit (ATPSβ). Using antibody inhibition and siRNA
targeting the ATPSβ, the authors showed a significant reduction of viral entry in Aedes
albopictus and aegypti cell lines (Fongsaran et al. 2014). Moreover, the SINV infection of
mosquito salivary glands by feeding of Aedes aegypti, previously infected with a heparan sulfate
proteoglycan (HSPG), led to more cytopathic effects, indicating an association between SINV
and HSPG in the mosquito (Ciano, Saredy, and Bowers 2014).
                                                                                                28


Concerning specific receptors of alphaviruses, using a whole genome screen in Drosophila cells
with   siRNA    technology,     the   natural-resistance    associated     macrophage      protein
(NRAMP2/Malvolio/DMT1) was described as the receptor of SINV in Drosophila as well as in
mosquito and mammalian cells (Rose et al. 2011). Recently, Mxra8 has been demonstrated to
be the receptor of several arthritogenic alphaviruses like CHIKV, RRV, Mayaro and O’nyong
nyong viruses in mammalian cells and mouse (Zhang et al. 2018), and involved in the
pathogenesis of CHIKV in mouse and transgenic Drosophila (Zhang et al. 2019). Concerning the
glycoprotein involved in the binding, it seems that E2 is the candidate for attachment to GAGs
(Silva et al. 2014) and to the Mxra8 receptor (Zhang et al. 2018).

Following binding, alphaviruses are internalized into the cell via the formation of clathrin-
dependent endocytosis vesicles, then the clathrin-coated vesicles are uncoated and form
endosomes (Bernard et al. 2010), leading to the release of nucleocapsids and viral genomes via
fusion between the membranes of endosomes and viral particles. Alphaviruses were shown to
enter mainly via clathrin-mediated endocytosis even though in some cell lines another pathway
can be used for alphavirus-entry. Indeed, using siRNAs against the clathrin chain, CHIKV
infection in 293T was not decreased, while in two other cell lines (HUVEC and U2OS) CHIKV
infection decreased drastically (Bernard et al. 2010).

Thus, it seems that the entry pathway in mammalian cells could be cell-specific, at least in vitro.
Moreover, it has been shown that the fusion process occurs in early endosomal compartments
for SINV, SFV and CHIKV (van Duijl-Richter et al. 2015; Marsh, Bolzau, and Helenius 1983) but in
late endosomes for VEEV (Colpitts et al. 2007). Finally, in mosquito cells, it has been shown that
CHIKV and VEEV entry also use the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway; however, this entry
seems dependent on Rab5 and Rab7-positive endosomes, suggesting a fusion process in early
and late endosomes (Colpitts et al. 2007; Nuckols et al. 2014).




                      Fusion and Viral genome release


The molecular mechanisms involved in membrane fusion are highly conserved between
alphaviruses in mammalian cells and seem similar in mosquito cells. Indeed, this process is low
pH and cholesterol dependent. The fusion process requires the destabilization of the E1-E2


                                                                                                29


heterodimer leading to the exposure of the E1 fusion loop, the integration and trimerization of
E1 glycoprotein inside the endosome target membrane, and the formation of fusion pores. First,
the mildly acidic pH in endosomes triggers the destabilization of E1-E2 and a domain of the E2
glycoprotein moves away, exposing the E1 hydrophobic fusion loop. The presence of
cholesterol in the target membrane and specific amino acids in E1, important for lipid and pH
sensing, enhances the fusion potential. Then, as the pH decreases, E2 is completely dissociated
from E1 which can trimerize. This step brings the viral membrane closer to the endosomal
membrane, forcing them to merge in a process called hemifusion (van Duijl-Richter et al. 2015).
Finally, the fusion pore is formed and can expand, allowing the nucleocapsid access to the
cytoplasm where the replication process will occur.

                       Replication complex and assembly


The RNA synthesis of alphaviruses is an associated-membrane process. However, it seems that
different membranes and vesicles are involved in the replication of viral RNA in mammalian and
mosquito cells (Figure 4).


In mammalian cells, replication is initiated in the cytoplasm by the expression of the nsP1234
precursor from the 49S of viral RNA and followed by the cleavage of nsP123 and nsP4 by nsP2
protease activity. The polyprotein P123 and nsP4 associate with the viral RNA and host proteins
form the membrane-bound replication complex (RC) used for the generation of full-length
minus-strand synthesis. The proteolytic process on P123 causes the release of nsP1, nsP2 and
nsP3. It has been shown recently that the hypervariable domain of nsP3 interacts with the
mammalian cellular factor FHL1, promoting the replication of viral RNA (Meertens et al. 2019).
Moreover, nsP2 and nsP3 have been reported to induce a transcriptional and translational shut-
off of the mouse 3T3 cell line infected by SINV, participating in the efficient viral replication and
inhibition of host response (Akhrymuk, Frolov, and Frolova 2018).

Figure 4: Replicative cycle of the Sindbis virus (Alphavirus) in mammalian (A) and
mosquito (B) cell lines. SINV is internalized into the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Fusion between the endosome and the viral particle is pH dependent and releases the viral
genome into the cytoplasm (steps 1 to 5). Then, non-structural proteins are translated and the
association of viral non-structural proteins with cellular proteins forms the replication complex
RC and induces spherule structures on the endosome and plasma membranes in mammals and
only in large internal vesicles in the mosquito, where the nucleocapsid is still detectable (steps
6 to 8). The formation of spherules allows the translation of structural proteins from subgenomic
26S RNA and the translocation of glycoproteins but not capsid into the endoplasmic reticulum
and Golgi apparatus for glycosylation, maturation, and plasma membrane translocation via the
secretory pathway (steps 9 to 12). In parallel, in the cytoplasm viral capsid associates with new
viral RNA produced from the intermediate negative strand, forming the nucleocapsid NC (step
13). The NC binds the glycoprotein E2-E1-E3 complex and buds at the plasma membrane in
mammals. In the mosquito a second internal budding site seems to involve large vesicles (step
14 in mammal cells and steps 14 and 15 in mosquito cells). CPV (-I and -II): cytoplasmic
structure type I or II (Jose et al., 2017).




                                                                                               31


Then, the maturation of RC induces bulb-shaped membrane invaginations called “spherules” in
type I cytoplasmic structures (CPV-I) where RNA synthesis occurs. The CPV-I originate from
endosomes and are maybe guided by nsP1 to the plasma membrane (PM) thanks to the capacity
of nsP1 to interact with phospholipids of cellular membranes in mammalian cells, as shown in
SFV-infected BHK cells (Kujala et al. 2001). Next, the structural proteins Capsid-E3-E2-6K-E1 are
translated from the 26S subgenomic RNA and then autocatalytically processed at the N
terminus by the serine protease activity of the capsid. The capsid is released into the cytoplasm
and the remaining structural polyprotein E3-E2-6K-E1 translocates to the Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus thanks to a signal peptide present at the N-terminal
region.

Once in the RE, the E1 and E2 precursor (pE2) assemble in heterodimers, and during Golgi
maturation a furin cleavage releases E3 to the E1-E2 heterodimers. In the cytoplasm, the capsid
encapsidates new single genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsid (NC), associated with type II
cytopathic vacuoles that contain E1-E2 glycoproteins and originate from the Golgi network. The
CPV-II is presumably involved in the transport of glycoproteins and NC to the plasma membrane
which is the site of virus budding.


In mosquito cells, it has been shown that the RC of SINV is not found at the PM and does not
form in CPV-I but in acidic vesicles that contain the viral glycoproteins, which is not the case in
mammalian cells. In addition to different morphologies in these cytopathic vacuoles in
mosquito and mammalian cells, additional internal budding of particles has been shown in
mosquito vesicles (Jose et al. 2017).
Authors have hypothesized that in the mosquito, alphavirus replication and assembly processes
have evolved to a state that favors persistent infection, maybe by preventing antiviral cellular
response. Interestingly, the replication of alphaviruses in CPV-I and -II in mammal cells is similar
to that of mosquito vacuoles and suggests that even in the mammal system, alphaviruses have
evolved to escape the immune response during replication. However, in the study of Jose et
al., the Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line was used. Although these cells are known to present a
dysfunctional RNA interference (RNAi) antiviral response and thus may not be the best cellular
model, this article is one of the only complete in vitro studies on alphavirus infection in
mammals and mosquitos.

The assembly of new particles takes place at the plasma membrane where one new virion is
composed of 240 copies of capsid associated with the viral genome and 80 spikes of E1-E2
glycoproteins in the plasma membrane. The capsid and E2 interact and drive the budding
process where the virions acquire a bilayer membrane from the mammalian or mosquito cell.

2 Chikungunya virus – an Old-World alphavirus

             Discovery


The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was first described as a human pathogen after isolation in the
serum of infected patient suffering from arthritic disease in 1952 in Tanzania. The name
chikungunya refers to this characteristic posture of infected patients and means “that which
bends up” in the African Kimakonde language (Lumsden et al. 1955; Robinson et al. 1955; Ross
et al. 1956). However, some research suggests that CHIKV outbreaks occurred around 1780 but
were attributed to Dengue virus infections. Indeed, the signs and symptoms are very close, and
these viruses circulate in the same areas. Most infected people develop an acute illness
characterized by fever, rash, headache, incapacitating polyarthralgia, arthritis and myalgia.
However, unlike Dengue, a characteristic of CHIKV disease is a recurring musculoskeletal
disease that can persist for several months to years after acute infection. CHIKV disease in the
human host has a low fatality rate (less than 0.1%), but the acute and chronic illnesses have a
considerable impact on the quality of life.

             Transmission cycles and vector distribution


CHIKV was originally transmitted in natural forest habitats between Aedes (Ae.) arboreal
mosquitoes and nonhuman primates (monkeys) and other vertebrates (birds, rodents), which
do not seem to show symptoms of infection and can help to maintain the virus in nature due to
high viremia. This type of transmission is termed an enzootic sylvatic transmission cycle.
Humans can become infected if they encroach into the forest habitat, through deforestation,
agriculture, urbanization or hunting, and are bitten by infected mosquitoes or if infected
mosquitoes move into areas of human habitation. When an infected human enters an urban
area, the arbovirus infection can spread amongst other humans via anthropophilic urban
mosquitoes, i.e. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. At this moment, the sylvatic transmission cycle
can switch to an urban transmission cycle. In densely populated tropical regions, the urban
transmission cycle can cause an explosive epidemic in which the virus can be maintained in the
population (Figure 5).




     Figure 5: Sylvatic and urban transmission cycles


Regarding the vectors involved in the sylvatic transmission cycle of CHIKV, in Africa, this virus
has been detected in forest Aedes species like Ae. aegypti, Ae. furcifer, Ae. africanus, and Ae.
taylori (Diallo et al. 1999). Aedes aegypti has become very well adapted to urban environments
in Africa and has progressively spread from tropical Africa to North Africa and also in the New
World and Asia (Powell and Tabachnick 2013). In Asia, CHIKV is mainly maintained in urban

transmission cycles between humans and Aedes aegypti and albopictus. Aedes albopictus was
originally found in forests of Southeast Asia but is now also present in rural areas and can
colonize tropical and temperate regions. In Europe, it is now established in almost 20 countries
and Europe is considered to be vulnerable to the transmission of CHIKV and other “tropical”
arboviruses like DENV.
Vertical transmission via the eggs of an infected female mosquito has been shown to occur
experimentally at a very low rate in Aedes aegypti infected by CHIKV (Agarwal et al. 2014).
During the CHIKV epidemic in La Réunion in 2005-2006, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus
was reported for 10 newborns among 84 infected pregnant women (Robillard et al. 2006).


             Epidemiology


Since the first reports of CHIKV infected patients, several epidemics occurred in sub-Saharan
Africa and Asia throughout latter half of 20th century. Thanks to phylogenetic analyses on CHIKV
sequences, three distinct lineages have been identified, two from Africa and one from Asia: the
West African (WA) lineage, the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage and the Asian lineage.
In Africa, the epidemic emergence of CHIKV is induced by transition from the sylvatic cycle
involving the mosquito vector and non-human primates into the urban cycle involving the
mosquito vector and human hosts, while in Asia, CHIKV seems to circulate principally in the
urban cycle. The re-emergence of an ECSA strain occurred during an outbreak in Kenya in 2004
and spread to a number of Indian Ocean islands including Comoros, Seychelles, Mayotte,
Mauritius, Madagascar and La Réunion (Coffey, Failloux, and Weaver 2014). During the
epidemic of La Réunion, in 2005-2006, the magnitude of the outbreak was unexpected with
approximately one third of the population infected (approximately 260 000 infected
individuals) and 300 deaths. The strain at the origin of the epidemic in the Indian Ocean islands
has been named Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) and presents an Alanine (A) amino acid at position
226 of the E1 protein. However, a new strain during the outbreak in La Réunion has been
identified and presents a mutation in the E1 protein and gene: with a Valine (V) in the place of
the Alanine (A) at position 226 (E1-A226V). S. Higgs and colleagues proposed that this mutation
has influenced the fitness of the virus for the new vector Aedes albopictus, but also viral
infectivity and tropism (Tsetsarkin et al. 2007). Indeed, this hypothesis provides a plausible


                                                                                              35


explanation of how the virus strain causes an epidemic in a region lacking the principal vector
Aedes aegypti. First, they proposed that the E1-A226V mutation could modify the cholesterol
dependence of the virus (Tsetsarkin et al. 2007). However, later they advanced that adaptation
to Aedes albopictus does not correlate with this cholesterol dependence (Tsetsarkin, McGee,
and Higgs 2011). In addition to the Indian Ocean islands, the virus spread in India and parts of
Southeast Asia with six million estimated cases of CHIKV disease. Air travelers have largely
facilitated the expansion of the virus, even in more temperate regions like Europe and the
United States (Gibney et al. 2011). For example, the first autochthonous transmission was
reported in Italy in 2007 and in France in 2010 (Grandadam et al. 2011; Rezza et al. 2007). The
global expansion of the chikungunya virus occurred from 2011 to 2014, with outbreaks in the
Western Pacific, South Pacific and Caribbean and the spread of the Asian lineage strain in the
Americas and the ECSA lineage in Brazil. Because of globalization, climate change, areas of
dense population and the presence of relevant vectors, the risk of explosive outbreaks in the
Western Hemisphere is high (Figure 6).

             Infectious route in competent vectors


Among the many species of mosquitoes, only a small number can acquire arbovirus infection
and transmit it to an uninfected vertebrate. It seems that there is a specificity in the vector-
arbovirus interaction, combining vector intrinsic factors such as mosquito physiology, genetic
or antiviral cellular responses and consequently viral replication and propagation.
In comparison to the vertebrate host, arboviruses do not seem to cause significant pathology
in the mosquito vector. From the oral acquisition of a viremic bloodmeal to the transmission to
a new uninfected vertebrate host, the arbovirus replicates in the cells of the arthropod and
must cope with antiviral pathways such as cell death and innate immune responses and several
tissue barriers from the midgut until the saliva. Indeed, among the many species of mosquito,
some are permissive (competent) and other are resistant to the infection and part of this
competence is linked to the several tissue barriers that can be crossed or not during viral
dissemination. Figure 7 shows a schematic presentation of the typical route in a permissive
mosquito and the four principal tissue barriers (Midgut Infection Barrier MIB; Midgut Escape
Barrier MEB; Salivary Gland Infection Barrier SGIB and Salivary Gland Escape Barrier SGEB).


In this part we describe the typical route of alphavirus infection in competent and permissive
mosquitos, defined by 1) the acquisition of the virus; 2) passage through different barriers, and
3) replication and dissemination to salivary glands to successful transmission to another
vertebrate host. The role of vector immune and cell death responses in determining vector
competence (VC) in overcoming tissue barriers will be discussed in the following part.


                       The initial site of infection: the midgut


The digestive tube of the mosquito is divided into three major regions: the foregut, the midgut,
and the hindgut. The foregut is a region extending from the mouth to the midgut and the
foregut extending to the anus. The midgut epithelium is surrounded by an extracellular matrix,
called basal lamina (BL) on the internal side of the mosquito. After a viremic bloodmeal, viruses
enter the midgut lumen and are close to the single layer of epithelial cells (Figure 7). It has been
shown that a small number of cells can be infected during this initial infection. For example,
VEEV infects an average of 28 midgut cells in the Aedes mosquito and WNV less than 15 midgut


                                                                                                 37


cells in Culex (Scholle and Mason, 2004; Smith and Weaver, 2008). Moreover, specific regions
of the midgut (posterior, and/or anterior regions) are preferentially infected. From this step,
the virus is confronted with the midgut tissue barrier composed of an epithelial layer separating
the lumen of the midgut from the hemocoel (blood-containing body cavity and function as part
of the circulatory system). Once the virus enters a cell, viral replication starts, and the place of
viral maturation and accumulation can also vary, according to the virus-mosquito combination.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been shown to be involved in EEEV synthesis in Ae.
triseriatus but, in contrast, it seems that CHIKV does not enter the cisternae of the ER in Ae.
aegypti cells (Franz et al. 2015). These differences could be linked to a different temporal
analysis of infection or a virus-vector specific interaction. New virions are accumulated at the
plasma membrane facing the basal surface and, after budding, viruses are in contact with the
basal lamina of the epithelium and need to pass through it to enter the hemocoel and
disseminate. The basal lamina predominantly consists of laminin and collagen IV and presents
small pores with a size exclusion of 9-12 nm. The BL acts as a very strong mechanical barrier for
viruses and the pores are too small for alphaviruses to pass through (60-80 nm).
However, during bloodmeal digestion, it has been shown that the basal lamina is degraded by
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and becomes permissive. This change in basal lamina
integrity was observed in Culex pipiens infected by WNV. However, in Aedes aegypti infected
by CHIKV it has been shown that, curiously, overexpression of the Ae.aegypti tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinases (AeTIMP) induces the efficient dissemination of CHIKV (Dong, Balaraman,
et al. 2017). As basal lamina degradation/remodeling involves activities of metalloproteinases
and inhibitors, they hypothesized that the expression of inhibitors could be accompanied by the
transient restructuring of basal lamina allowing the passage of CHIKV.
Following dissemination from the midgut, the virus disseminates up to the salivary glands and
saliva. To disseminate to secondary organs , the hemocytes (insect blood cells) have been
shown to be an important vehicle in the case of SINV infection of Ae.aegypti (Parikh, Oliver, and
Bartholomay 2009). Moreover, it has been proposed that the infection of hemocytes leads to a
high rate of infection which is required before the infection of salivary glands. Indeed, since only
a few epithelial cells of the midgut are infected, the quantity of viral particles after the passage
through basal lamina is small. It has been proposed that hemocytes are a vehicle for the virus
to the salivary glands and allow the replication of the virus to produce enough particles for
efficient infection of the mosquito’s head.

                      The final site of infection: the salivary glands


The salivary glands of female mosquitoes are paired organs located in the thorax and each gland
is composed of three lobes (two lateral and one median). Each lobe presents a central internal
duct containing a cavity for saliva storage and surrounded by a monolayer of epithelial and
acinar cells that connect the lobes. The monolayer is bounded externally by a BL. Once again,
the salivary glands consist of a tissue barrier that must be crossed by the virus to reach the
saliva. The CHIKV, present in the hemocoel must penetrate the BL to join the acinar cells and
replicate inside to then be disseminated into the saliva cavity and released during blood
feeding. It seems that CHIKV can infect both the lateral and median lobes of Ae. aegypti (Janzen,

                                                                                              39


Rhodes, and Doane 1970), whereas SINV can infect only the lateral lobe in Ae. albopictus
(Bowers, Abell, and Brown 1995). In Ae. albopictus, CHIKV particles were observed in acinar
cells and in the apical cavity where the virus can be stored in saliva. Interestingly, Vega-Rua and
colleagues showed that the nucleocapsid could bud at the plasma membrane of acinar cells and
at the membrane of vesicles located in the apical cavity (Vega-Rúa et al. 2015). Once in the
cavities of acinar cells during new blood feeding, the virus is released with saliva into the
vertebrate host.

The saliva of the mosquito contains several proteins such as degrading enzymes,
antimicrobials, and anti-inflammatory peptides. The proteins in the salivary glands of Ae.
aegypti infected by CHIKV were triggered at 3- and 6-days post-infection (dpi) and showed the
regulation of about ten secreted proteins at both times. Proteins involved in the anti-
inflammatory effect, blood feeding and some protease inhibitors were increased while anti-
oxidant related proteins like protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) involved in re-establishment of
redox homeostasis were downregulated (Tchankouo-Nguetcheu et al. 2012). The proteins
found in the saliva of infected mosquitoes could participate in the primo infection in the skin of
host vertebrates. Indeed, the presence of anti-inflammatory protein and protease inhibitors
could lower the host anti-viral immune response and subsequently create an efficient micro-
environment for viral infection. However, it has been shown that the host vertebrate immune
response of a murine model can induce specific antibody IgG response against the salivary
protein called 34k2 from Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. Interestingly, as the proteins
showed very a low level of immune cross-reactivity, they proposed to use this protein as
species-specific markers of host exposure (Montero et al. 2019).

                      Human infection: clinical signs


CHIKV disease in humans is symptomatic in 72-95 % of cases with an incubation period of 2 to
4 days. The infection is characterized by an acute phase with febrile illness: fever in 90% of
patients (>39°C) and frequently accompanied by muscle (myalgia) and joint (arthralgia) pains in
about 85% of patients. Other symptoms include headache, cutaneous manifestations, and

                                                                                                40


digestive troubles. The acute phase generally disappears after one or two weeks. However, for
around 35% of patients, joint pain can persist for several weeks to months and present similarity
with rheumatoid arthritis. A systematic review has shown that around 25% of CHIKV cases
would develop post-CHIKV chronic inflammatory rheumatism for more than 15 months and
14% would present chronic arthritis (Rodríguez-Morales et al. 2016). In addition to typical
symptoms, during the CHIKV outbreak on La Réunion, some neurological complications were
described for the first time, such as encephalitis and encephalopathy, showing a new CHIKV
tropism for the central nervous system (Matusali et al. 2019).




                      Acute and chronic phases


In this part we present the dissemination of CHIKV from the skin to secondary organs and
cellular tropism. Moreover, knowledge of characteristic-associated alphavirus chronicity will be
introduced.

Acute CHIKV infection is generally associated with high fever, rashes, and severe muscle and
joint pains for 7 to 10 days. It follows the chronic CHIKV disease typically defined by
musculoskeletal disease for several months and sometimes for years, beyond the onset of acute
disease. Chronic CHIKV disease has been reported principally after the outbreak in La Réunion
in 2006-2007. While the majority of individuals fully recovered, a large proportion of individuals
experienced chronic CHIKV disease and long-term impaired quality of life has been reported for
some individuals (McCarthy, Davenport, and Morrison 2018).

Following CHIKV inoculation through mosquito bite, viral particles enter the subcutaneous
capillaries, where they are in contact with susceptible cells in the skin (Figure 8). The main
infected cells are fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages (Dupuis-Maguiraga et al.
2012). Local replication in the skin is associated with a very early Type-I interferon response.
Indeed, IFNα/β was detected very early in the infection and its concentration is correlated with
viral load in plasma. On the one hand, the production of IFNα for ten days was associated with
viral clearance without detection of adaptative immunity through IFNγ in serum (Chow et al.
2011).



                                                                                               41


On the other hand, Hoarau et al. observed a high level of IFNγ and cytokines IL-12 in patients
from La Réunion (Dupuis-Maguiraga et al. 2012) and Wauquier et al. showed an overproduction
of IFNα and IFNγ during the acute phase in infected individuals in Gabon (Wauquier et al. 2011)
(Figure 9). The skin represents the site of local viral replication following a mosquito bite, and
the new particles produced are probably transported to secondary lymphoid organs not far
from the site of inoculation. Moreover, blood transports viral particles either in free virion form
or in the form of infected monocytes, to the target organs like liver, muscle, joints, and the
central nervous system (Schwartz and Albert 2010). While the evidence of production of viral
particles from monocytes has not been demonstrated, Her et al. have detected CHIKV antigens
in monocytes exposed to MOI 10 to 50 and this result was supported by the detection of
antigen-positive monocytes from acutely infected patients (Her et al. 2010).




Figure 8: CHIKV dissemination and targets in the human. Transmission of CHIKV to
humans occurs following a female Ae.aegypti or Ae.albopictus mosquito bite. The virus can
replicate in the skin (fibroblasts and melanocytes cells) and disseminate to the liver (endothelial
cells), lymphoid tissue, muscles (fibroblasts and satellite cells) and joints (fibroblasts) and the
brain through the bloodstream. The persistent phase is characterized by persistent muscle and
joint pains. The persistent phase seems to involve macrophage and monocyte inflammatory
response (based on Matusali et al. 2019; Schwartz and Albert 2010).


                                                                                                42


The Chikungunya virus reaches muscles and joints where myalgia and/or arthralgia symptoms
may persist for several weeks, months or even years. Following the outbreak at La Réunion, it
was described in muscle biopsies from two patients that differentiated myotubes that were not
permissive to CHIKV, whereas satellite cells (skeletal muscle progenitor cells) were positive for
CHIKV (Ozden et al. 2007). The other characteristic disease symptom of CHIKV is arthralgia. Viral
RNA has been detected in the synovial tissues and fluids during acute and chronic CHIKV
infection, where synovial fibroblasts and macrophages were sensitive to CHIKV (Young et al.
2019).


Chronic CHIKV disease characterized by persistent arthralgia seems to be an immune and cell
death mediated response also associated with risk factors. Nevertheless, CHIKV antigens have
been detected only during the persistent phase. The osteoblasts are infected, leading to the
secretion of proinflammatory and pro-osteoclastic factors (IL-6, IL-1 β, CCL-2 and RANKL). In
normal joints, the cytokine RANKL (receptor activator of the nuclear factor NF-κB ligand) can
induce the differentiation of osteoblasts into osteoclasts and OPG (osteoprotegerin) can inhibit
the action of RANKL. The RANKL:OPG ratio controls this differentiation. However, during CHIKV
infection the RANKL:OPG ratio increases, favoring osteoclast differentiation and leading to bone
loss and promoting inflammation (Chen et al. 2015). Viral persistence suggests that cells can be
chronically infected and are perhaps able to control or block cell death. However, it has been
observed that in chronic CHIKV individuals, the damaged synovial tissues present an intense
immune response on the one hand and a strong programmed cell death characteristic on the
other (Hoarau et al. 2010). Interestingly, it has been shown that the human monocyte MM6 cell
line was infected with a very low rate of RRV replication and the infection led to a late apoptotic
cell death feature without immune response control, suggesting that monocytes could be a viral
reservoir during chronic RRV disease (Krejbich-Trotot et al. 2016). In parallel, the infection of
macrophages in joints was associated with the production of cytokines and chemokines such as
interleukins (IL)-6, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and, moreover, it has been proposed that the
phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies from infected fibroblasts could also participate in viral
persistence and the inflammation of musculoskeletal tissues in chronic CHIKV disease. Finally,
Natural Killer NK cells and T cells together with monocytes were found activated and attracted
to joint tissues (Dupuis-Maguiraga et al. 2012), (Figure 9). Nevertheless, the mechanisms

                                                                                                43


involved in viral persistence are still poorly understood as are the beneficial and deleterious
effect of local inflammation and cell death on viral persistence.




Figure 9: Schematic representation of CHIKV pathogenesis and immune response in
humans. Following a mosquito bite, the virus infects different cells of the skin and disseminates
to secondary organs through blood vessels. After the incubation period of around 4 days, the
symptoms of the acute phase are triggered and accompanied by IFN-I response in
nonhematopoietic cells. One week after infection, the viral load decreases and ~70% of infected
patient recover and present evidence of CHIKV-specific adaptative immunity, whereas ~30% of
patients experience long-term sequela with persistent infection for several months or years.



             Vaccine, antiviral treatments, and strategies in humans and mosquitos


Two strategies against CHIKV and other arboviruses have emerged: the first is the development
of a vaccine for humans and the second the inhibition of viral infection in mosquito.




                      Vaccine and antiviral treatments in humans


To date, no specific treatments or licensed vaccines are available. Up to now, patients have
been treated with symptomatic treatments like anti-inflammatory drugs to treat chronic
arthralgia and myalgia. Chloroquine, a known drug against malaria, initially showed promising
results in patients, however, several years later it was documented that after 200 days of
treatment, patients complained more about joint pain than control group (Brighton 1984; De

                                                                                              44


Lamballerie et al. 2008). Another anti-inflammatory molecule, named bindarit, had been
shown useful in the treatment of CHIKV-induced arthritis in a mouse model (Rulli et al. 2011).


Regarding vaccines, a recent publication reported the success of an experimental CHIKV
vaccine (phase 2) which confers durable immune response and is safe for healthy volunteers
aged 18 to 60 (Chen et al. 2020). The volunteers received two intramuscular doses of the
vaccine and showed strong immune response to CHIKV after 72 weeks of the study (Chang et
al. 2014; Chen et al. 2020). This vaccine approach is based on a virus-like particle (VLP)
presenting structural proteins recognized by the immune system, suggesting a protective
immune response to the CHIKV.

Other vaccines are under development such as a chimeric vaccine with a VSV backbone and
CHIKV structural proteins (Chattopadhyay et al. 2013), and a recombinant measle-virus-based
chikungunya vaccine (Ramsauer et al. 2015).



                      Antiviral strategies in the mosquito


In response to insecticide resistance, alternative strategies are needed for controlling the
vector and preventing epidemics. Previously, the primary strategy was the use of synthetic
chemicals to kill adult vectors using aerial spraying. In parallel, the control of larvae has been
developed by chemical application, microbial larvicides and biological agents (predator fishes
that eat mosquito larvae). The obstacle to larval control is the ability of detect, access, and
eliminate the breeding zone, which is a costly task. Thus, new strategies have been developed
thanks to entomological and epidemiological approaches such as attractive targeted sugar
baits, the bacteria Wolbachia, the sterile insect technique and genetic manipulation (Achee et
al. 2019). The impact of Wolbachia in the inhibition of arbovirus in the mosquito will be
discussed below (Chapter 3).

3 Cellular responses in Alphaviruses-infected mammals and insects

Soon after viral detection, different cellular pathways are activated to control viral replication
such as innate immune response and apoptosis. In vertebrates, the innate immune response
seems essential to limit viral replication, whereas in the mosquito vector competence seems to
be linked to a basal immune response. In parallel, it is not clear if the apoptosis induced in
infected mammals and mosquitos is an anti-viral or pro-viral response. These two pathways
linked to others and the viral strategies to counteract cell defense will be discussed in this
chapter.



             Innate immune response


                      In mammals


Following the bite of an infected mosquito, the infection of fibroblasts and other cells by
alphaviruses leads to the production of Type-I IFN, as described in the previous chapter. The
production of IFN-I is triggered by the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The PAMPs include surface glycoproteins,
single-strand RNA, and double-strand RNA.



-   The Toll-like receptors
The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound glycoproteins found at the PM and in
endosomes. They are composed of an extracellular leucine-rich domain that mediates the
recognition of PAMPs and an intracellular domain, Toll-Interleukin-I resistance (TIR) that
mediates the recruitment of downstream proteins. The dimerization of TLRs is induced by the
binding of PAMP to the TLR, which induces change receptor conformation and allows recruiting
adaptor proteins and initiating the signaling pathway. The dsRNA produced during alphavirus
replication and internalized in the endosome can be detected by TLR. TLR3 was identified as
being essential against viral dsRNA (Lai et al. 2011; Priya, I. K. Patro, and Parida 2014) and is
expressed in the endosome and phagosome and at the surface of fibroblasts. Following TLR3


                                                                                               46


stimulation, the expression of IFN-I is promoted by IRF3 and IRF7 (Interferon regulatory factor)
and Nuclear factor NF-NB transcription factors through the activation of adaptor protein TRIF
(TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFNβ, also called TICAM1). Indeed, TRIF binds to TLR3
and recruits TRAF3 or TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor). The association with TRAF3
allows recruiting TBK-1 (TANK-binding protein 1) and IKKH (Inhibitor of nuclear factor Kappa-B
factor Kinase subunit epsilon), which catalyze IRF3 and IRF7 phosphorylation to promote their
nuclear translocation and binding to the IFN-I promoter (Pfeffer 2011). The TRAF6 association
leads to receptor-interacting protein RIP1 recruitment, the transforming growth factor β-
associated kinase TAK1 and IKK α and β (Figure 10 “Infected cell”). The inactive NF-NB is retained
by its inhibitor INB in the cytoplasm. INB phosphorylation by IKK leads to the degradation of IkB,
which allows NF-NB nuclear translocation and the transcription of target genes comprising IFN-
I and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNFα (Takeda and Akira 2015).

Her et al. have shown an increase in CHIKV susceptibility in human and mouse fibroblasts with
defective TLR3 signaling. Moreover, antibodies against CHIKV generated in Tlr3 -/- mice present
a lower neutralizing capacity in vitro (Her et al. 2015). Moreover, the immune response has
been characterized in the brain of CHIKV-infected mice with up-regulation of antiviral genes
and cytokines such as TLR3, TRAF6, TRIF, IFNβ, IL-6, Mx-2, and OAS. They confirmed the role of
TLR3 by pretreatment with Poly I:C (a TLR3 agonist) accompanied by the reduction of CHIKV
titer in the brain and the protection of mice (Priya, I K Patro, and Parida 2014). Interestingly,
differences have been identified in immune response intensity and viral replication by
comparing the ECSA CHIKV genotype without mutation at position E1 226 (A226) and with
mutation (A226V). The 226V mutant showed relatively lower induction of TLR3 and 7, IFNβ,
OAS-3, Mx in a mice neuroblastoma N2a cell line. Knowing that the CHIKV 226V strain is more
virulent, the associated downstream antiviral response could participate in higher pathogenesis
(Priya et al. 2013).

The ssRNA of alphaviruses can be recognized by TLR7 and TLR8 present only in the endosome
compartment and activate a signaling pathway through the adaptor myeloid differentiation
primary-response protein 88 (MyD88). TLR8 leads to the activation of NF-κB through the TRAF6
and IKK complex, whereas TRL7 activates IFN-I production through TRAF6/3 and IRF3/7 factors.




                                                                                               47


To conclude, IRF3/7 and NF-κB participate in the activation of IFNβ and pro-inflammatory
cytokines and are essential against alphaviruses infections. NF-κB is involved in an antiviral,
protective response and in the induction of cell death, which will be discussed in the following
section.



-   Detection of cytoplasmic viral RNA by cytoplasmic nucleic acid receptors

In addition to the Toll-like receptors, another mechanism can detect viral RNA and control
infection: the TLR-independent mechanism. IFN-inducible RNA helicase RIG-I (retinoic acid-
inducible gene product I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 MDA-5 can detect
cytoplasmic RNA and induce IFN expression (Priya et al. 2013). These proteins present a C-
terminal helicase domain, accompanied with ATPase activity and a caspase-recruitment
domain (CARD) in the N-terminal region. The activation of RIG-I and MDA5 induces a
conformational change that allows exposing the CARD domain and mediating several
interactions. For example, the CARD domain can bind to MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral
signaling protein), which is anchored in the membrane of the mitochondrion and acts as an
adaptor protein leading to the activation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Moreover, by this interaction, the
MAVS can participate in the activation of caspases involved in the apoptotic cell death pathway.
The association of MAVS with TRADD (TNFR1- Associated death domain protein) in a complex
involving TRAF6, FADD and IKK complex leads to the activation of NF-κB, while the complex
involving TRAF3 leads to the activation of IRF3/7 and the induction of IFNβ production (Figure
10 “Infected cell”).

Interestingly, it has been shown that VEEV and RVFV infections lead to a macromolecular
reorganization of IKKβ that subsequently produces a lower molecular weight complex, and IKKβ
seems to be involved in viral replication and the production of VEEV. Indeed, a decrease in RNA
copies and infectious particles has been observed with IKKβ inhibitor treatment and by using
mammalian cell IKKβ-/-; the infection of in vivo mice pretreated with this inhibitor increased
their survival. Finally, based on proteomics analysis, it has been suggested that nsP3 could
interact with IKKβ, suggesting that the IKKβ function is required for VEEV replication (Amaya et
al. 2014).




                                                                                             48


The infection of human primary synovial fibroblasts with CHIKV has shown an increased level of
miRNA-146a expression, previously reported in synovial tissues affected by rheumatoid
arthritis. The miRNA are small non-coding RNAs that bind to target messengers and play an
important role in the regulation of infection, immune response, and inflammation. miRNA-146
expression is controlled by NF-NB and can directly downregulate the level of TRAF6 and IRAK1
(IL-1 receptor associated kinase 1), leading to the suppression of NF-NB signaling. During CHIKV
infection, it has been shown that the increase of cellular miRNA-146a results in the
downregulation of TRAF6 and IRAK1, suggesting a mechanism that exploits the RNA silencing
pathway by CHIKV to modulate immune response in fibroblasts (Selvamani, Mishra, and Singh
2014).




Figure 10: Type-I interferon production and JAK-STAT signaling pathway activation after
Alphavirus infection. The detection of ssRNA and intermediated dsRNA structures involve
different pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Toll-like receptors TLR3, TLR7 and 8 and
retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I – like receptors (RLRs)) like MDA5 and RIG-I activate a
signaling cascade involving adaptor protein MyD88, TRIF and Interferon response factors (IRF)
3 and 7. The pathways lead to the expression of IFN-I (IFN α and β), which is secreted in the
extracellular compartment to activate the Jak-STAT pathway by activation of IFNAR. Binding to
IFNAR leads to the activation of associated-receptors Janus kinase (JAK1) and Tyrosine kinase
(TYK1), which activate STAT by phosphorylation and dimerization and bind to IRF9 (forming the
ISGF3 complex). The transcription factor STAT-IRF9 translocates to the nucleus and induces
interferon stimulated gene (ISGs) transcription. The ISGs will protect infected and uninfected
cells, leading to the control of viral dissemination.

-   Pathway activated by IFN-I: The JAK-STAT signaling pathway

The production of IFNα and β activates the antiviral signaling pathway in the infected cell and
in uninfected neighboring cells to prevent their infection. IFNα/β is secreted into the
extracellular environment and recognized by the interferon-alpha receptor IFNAR (composed
of IFNAR1 and 2 subunits). The activation of IFNAR activates the receptor-associated Janus
kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which trigger the activation of transcription factors
STAT1 and STAT2 by phosphorylation and dimerization. Active STAT with IFN-regulatory factor
9 (IRF9) form the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which translocates to
the nucleus and binds to IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) sequences to activate antiviral
genes (Ivashkiv and Donlin 2014) (Figure 10 “Uninfected cell”).

An extensive study of SINV identified several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as ISG15
and RNase L (Lenschow et al. 2007). For CHIKV, an antiviral role of OAS3 in infected HeLa cells
has been reported (Bréhin et al. 2009). It has been also shown that IFN-I controls CHIKV
infection in non-immune cells in the mouse and the production of IFN by fibroblasts is
controlled by MAVS downstream of RIG-I and MDA5 (Schilte et al. 2010). Moreover, it has been
shown that IRF1 protects in vivo mouse against CHIKV infection in non-hematopoietic muscle
cells after 20 days, suggesting a protective role of IRF1 in the post-acute phase (Nair et al. 2017).

The OAS 2’-5’-oligoadenylate synthase proteins catalyze ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) into 2’-
5’-linked adenosine oligomers and these oligomers activate RNaseL that degrades both viral
and cellular RNAs into short fragments. This process inhibits virus replication of diverse RNA
viruses like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, family Rhabdoviridae), human parainfluenza virus-3
(HPIV, family Paramyxovirus). Moreover, OAS/RNaseL has been shown to induce apoptosis (A.
Zhou et al. 1998).

The Mx GTPases is a group of guanine-hydrolyzing enzymes. The human genome encodes MxA
and MxB but only MxA demonstrates an antiviral activity. The MxA protein can bind virus
structures and it has been shown that recognition of the Thogoto virus (THOV, family
Orthomyxoviridae) nucleocapsid leads to the inhibition of viral replication (Kochs and Haller
1999). Moreover, during SFV infection of human HEp-2 cells the antiviral activity of MxA has
been shown through the inhibition of viral replication and non-structural proteins synthesis
(Landis et al. 1998).


                                                                                                  50


Old-World Alphaviruses evolved to escape the immune response of vertebrates and it has been
discovered that the nsP2 of Old-World alphaviruses can affect the expression of ISGs by action
of nsP2 on STAT1 and by action on general transcriptional shut-off in vertebrate infected cells.
It has been shown that the C-terminal domain of CHIKV nsP2 promotes the nuclear export of
STAT1, avoiding STAT1 binding and consequently preventing the induction of ISGs (Göertz et al.
2018). Moreover, it has been shown that nsP2 of SFV, SINV and CHIKV can translocate to the
nucleus and induce the rapid degradation of RPB1, a subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex
(Ivan Akhrymuk, Kulemzin, and Frolova 2012). However, the degradation of RPB1 is
independent of the protease activity of nsP2, suggesting that nsP2 utilizes a cellular proteolytic
process for the degradation of RNA pol II. Rapid (around 6-8 hours post-infection) general
transcriptional shut-off can finally prevent all the different antiviral responses, not only immune
response but also cell death. Moreover, the non-structural protein NSs of Bunyamwera virus
(Bunyavirus) has been shown to interfere with mRNA transcription by targeting RNA
polymerase II and a mutant NSs is accompanied by a higher induction of IFN than WT (Thomas
et al. 2004; Weber et al. 2001). The non-structural protein NS1 of non-arbovirus Influenza A
virus (IAV, family Orthomyxoviridae) presents multiple functions of which a major one is the
deregulation of RNA Polymerase II, leading to a global transcriptional downregulation and
affecting antiviral response and virulence (Zhao et al. 2018).

New-World alphaviruses have also evolved to inhibit host transcription but, interestingly, it is
the capsid, and not nsP2 that is responsible for transcriptional inhibition, by forming a complex
with cellular factors inside the nucleus that consequently obstruct trafficking and lead to
decreased mRNA transcription (Lundberg, Carey, and Kehn-Hall 2017).



                      In the mosquito


The immune pathway in insects has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster
(Hoffmann 2003), after which global transcriptome analysis of the vectors Anopheles, Aedes
aegypti and Culex gave abundant genetic information about vector-borne interactions and the
involvement of immune response and cell death in vector competence. In this first section, we
will describe the immune pathways in the mosquito activated during arbovirus infection.

-   RNA interference (RNAi) pathway
RNAi in insects plays an important role in controlling and limiting virus infection. The RNAi
pathway was first discovered in the fruit fly Drosophila (Galiana-Arnoux et al. 2006). This
insect’s response utilizes virus-generated double strand RNA (dsRNA) to induce small
interfering RNA (siRNA) that allows targeting viral RNA for degrading and blocking viral
replication. Up to now, three different RNA interference pathways have been characterized:
silencing RNA (siRNA), micro RNA (miRNA) and PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA). siRNAs are
generated from dsRNA either derived from virus for example or encoded by the insect genome.
miRNAs are generated from cell transcripts and allow gene regulation at translational level.
piRNAs are transcribed from the cellular genome and occur in the germ line.

In this part, only the siRNA pathway will be described as predominantly responsible for antiviral
activity. The intermediate viral dsRNA is recognized by Dicer-2 (member of the RNase
endoribonuclease family) in complex with R2D2. The dsRNA is cleaved into 21 nucleotide siRNA
by Dicer-2 and loaded into the pre-RISC (pre-RNA-induced silencing complex) complex where
it is unwound, and the guide strand generated is used to target viral RNA by base pairing. The
recognition is ensured in RISC and the RNase activity of the Argonaute-2 (Ago-2) protein cleaves
the recognized viral RNA genome (Figure 11). In flies, the loss-of-function by mutations of the
Dicer-2 gene (dcr-2) or ago-2 fails to control viral replication. In Aedes and Anopheles species
infected by arbovirus, virus-derived siRNA have also been detected. In SINV-infected Ae.
aegypti, the RNAi pathway was activated by the production of virus-specific siRNA and the
silencing of RNAi components Dicer-2 and Ago-2 resulted in a transient increase of SINV
replication (Campbell et al. 2008). Keene and colleagues have shown that co-injection of the
O’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV)-GFP virus and dsRNA silencing Ago2 or Ago3 in Anopheles
gambiae result at 6 days post-injection (dpi) in an increase of viral replication and production.
Interestingly, they also silenced ONNV-nsP3 and showed a significant decrease in infection at
3 and 6 dpi, revealing an important role of nsP3 in viral replication and maybe in the control of
antiviral vector response (Keene et al. 2004). Additionally, an RNAi inhibitor B2 (viral
suppressor of RNAi (Sullivan and Ganem 2005)) gene adding into SINV genome has been shown
to increase the mortality rate of the mosquito and viral replication, indicating that an immune
response is involved in the control of viral replication and virus-induced pathogenic effects on
the vector (Cirimotich et al. 2009). Additional evidence for the importance of RNAi in limiting

arboviral infection in a permissive vector was obtained in studies using DENV-2 in the Ae.
aegypti mosquito (Sánchez-Vargas et al. 2009).

More recently, Mathur et al. described that CHIKV nsP2 and nsP3 exhibit an RNAi suppressor
activity in the Ae. aegypti Aag2 cell line, involving the helicase domain and the macrodomain,
respectively (Mathur et al. 2016).



-   The Toll pathway

The Toll pathway has been characterized as playing an essential role in the fly’s defense against
Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and viruses by the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
The expression of AMPs in the conserved signaling pathways Toll and IMD is regulated by the
activity of transcription factors of the NF-κB family (Mussabekova, Daeffler, and Imler 2017).
The Toll and IMD pathways share similarities with the inflammatory pathways regulated by
Toll-like receptors in mammals (interleukin-1 receptor and the TNF receptor). First, the
recognition of pathogen-derived ligands by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as
peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRP) triggers the cleavage of the neurotrophin-like
cytokine Späetzle, which circulates in the hemolymph as an inactive precursor and is cleaved
by proteolytic processing, allowing its activation and binding to the transmembrane receptor
Toll (Weber et al. 2003). Then, the associated adaptor proteins MyD88, Tube and the kinase
Pelle induce the phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the negative
regulator Cactus, allowing the release and translocation of NF-κB protein Rel1 (Dorsal in
Drosophila) to the nucleus and activation of Toll-pathway related genes like antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) (Figure 11).

The activation of the Toll pathway in the mosquito midgut has been reported (Sanders et al.
2005) at the early-stage of Ae.aegypti infection by SINV. The activation of the Toll pathway has
been also demonstrated in the midgut of Ae.aegypti infected by DENV at the early stage of
infection (3 dpi) (Ramirez and Dimopoulos 2010). Finally, silencing of MyD88 leads to increased
DENV infection and the transient activation of Rel1 reduces DENV infection in the midgut (Xi,
Ramirez, and Dimopoulos 2008). The activation of the Toll immune response in the midgut of
a major vector of DENV seems important for the control and reduction of the viral load which



                                                                                              53


could limit the infection. Also, it seems to be linked to efficient infection, possibly participating
in the permissiveness of the midgut.




Figure 11: Innate immune pathways in the mosquito: siRNA, Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT
pathways. The siRNA pathway is initiated when a virus-derived double-strand RNA (dsRNA)
in the cytoplasm is detected by Dicer-2 and R2D2 and cleaved into 21 base pairs (bp) siRNA
in length by Dicer-2. The siRNA is loaded in pre-RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
unwinds and degrades one of the siRNA strands and uses it to target and degrade a single-
strand viral RNA. Protein B2 of the flock house virus (FHV-insect virus only) can block siRNA
signaling. It was proposed that nsP2 and 3 of CHIKV also present an RNAi suppressor activity.
In the Toll pathway, the detection of PRRs triggers the cleavage of the cytokine Späetzle which
allows signaling through MyD88, Tube and Pelle and the degradation of Cactus. The
degradation of the negative regulator Cactus which was bound to Rel1, allows the nuclear
translocation of Rel1. The IMD pathway is activated by ligand binding to receptor triggering
through Imd, FADD and Dredd, a caspase and kinase activation and the nuclear translocation
of the Rel2 transcription factor. The JAK-STAT pathway is activated when Upd binds to the
receptor and activates the kinase receptor-associated Hop, which phosphorylates STAT. The
phosphorylation of STAT allows dimerization and nuclear translocation.



-   The IMD pathway

The immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is, like the Toll pathway, initiated by ligands binding to
PGPR and followed by signaling through adaptor protein IMD (Kleino and Silverman 2014).
Several caspase-like proteins and kinases then lead to splitting the pathway into two branches
for the activation of Relish (in Drosophila)/Rel2 (in mosquito). IMD activation recruits dFADD
that recruits the caspase-8 homolog Death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like protein DREDD, leading to

                                                                                                  54


the polyubiquitination of IMD. TAK1 binds to the polyubiquitin chain and is responsible of the
JNK pathway by assembly and activation of the IKK complex (IKKβ and IKKɣ). The IKK complex
mediates the phosphorylation of Rel2, which is cleaved by DREDD and can be translocated to
the nucleus and regulate the transcription of target-genes (Figure 11).



-   The JAK-STAT pathway

The JAK-STAT pathway is also a well conserved pathway in insects which was first discovered
in Drosophila and orthologs of STAT. Components have been predicted in several Anopheles
species and in Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. In the fly, the pathway is triggered by the
binding of Unpaired (Upd) to the cell surface receptor Dome, leading to its dimerization,
activation, and phosphorylation of receptor-associated Hop Janus kinases. This is followed by
the recruitment and phosphorylation of the STAT transcription factor, which can dimerize and
translocate to the nucleus to activate the expression of effector genes (figure 11).
The activation of Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways has been described in response to SINV and
DENV in Ae. aegypti and WNV in Culex pipens (Luplertlop et al. 2011; Zink et al. 2015).


A transcriptomic analysis of Aedes aegypti permissive and resistant strains infected with DENV
showed an enrichment of several immune-related transcripts of Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT
pathways in resistant but not in permissive mosquito strains. Moreover, many immune
transcripts were more abundant in the carcass (without midgut) of the resistant strain, but in
the midgut these transcripts were less abundant than in the permissive strain (Sim et al. 2013).
These results could suggest that the immune response in the midgut of the permissive strain is
necessary for efficient infection by Dengue virus, perhaps to lower the viral load at a specific
level allowing the passage through the midgut barrier and then dissemination. On the contrary,
the results obtained from resistant mosquitoes suggest that the infection of the midgut did not
induce a significant immune response leading to a higher viral load which could be detected
after the escape of from the midgut barrier, probably through the hemocytes. In the first case,
the mosquito can become chronically infected and in the second case the viral infection and
propagation were stopped. Was the cell antiviral immune response of a permissive vector
controlled by the virus through the evolution of the interaction?


                                                                                             55


-   Wolbachia
In addition to antiviral immune signaling pathways, other extrinsic factors can be involved in
the control of viral infection, such as the bacteria Wolbachia.

Wolbachia is an intracellular bacterium that can manipulate the reproduction of the insect
host. The transfer of the bacteria in laboratory Aedes mosquito strains inhibits viral
dissemination. Indeed, the artificial administration of the Wolbachia wMel strain (from
Drosophila) in Aedes aegypti and albopictus vectors increases resistance to DENV and CHIKV.
The same result was obtained in Drosophila melanogaster injected with CHIKV and Culex
quinquefasciatus infected with West Nile Virus (Glaser and Meola 2010). However, most of the
results were obtained with a high density of Wolbachia, higher than that detected naturally in
the mosquito. The presence of Wolbachia seems to impact arbovirus infection by the
upregulation of innate immune pathways like Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT, suggesting a first line
that rapidly blocks virus infection. Moreover, the competition for lipid metabolism and
autophagy modulation have also been suggested (Sinkins 2013).



To conclude this part, it is suggested that a specific level of immune response is required for
vector competence and in a compartment-dependent manner. It also seems obvious that other
intrinsic, extrinsic factors and signaling pathways are involved in efficient replication such as
control of cell death during viral replication. Indeed, apoptotic cell death is another efficient
antiviral response that can completely suppress viral replication. However, until now, it has not
been clear whether apoptosis plays a role in determining the outcome of arbovirus infection.


             Apoptosis


Apoptosis is a very well conserved pathway in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms, and it is
a tightly controlled process where the cell, in response to a wide range of stimuli like DNA
damage, oncogenic factors, virus infection and signals from immune cells activates different
self-destruction pathways. An apoptotic cell presents a characteristic morphology including
chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and loss of phospholipid asymmetry in the
membrane, in contrast with necrosis. Apoptosis culminates with the engulfment of the
apoptotic cell by phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, preventing the leakage of cytoplasm and

                                                                                              56


the activation of inflammatory response. The induction of apoptosis by different stimuli will
ultimately activate protease effectors responsible for the collapse of the cell.

               3.2.1.1 The apoptosis signaling pathway


-   Caspases: the proteases effectors of apoptosis
In 1993, Yuan and colleagues showed the involvement in apoptosis of a cysteine protease CED-
3 in Caenorhabditis elegans (Yuan et al. 1993). Since then several studies have identified at least
14 distinct mammalian caspases with their orthologs present in species ranging from
nematodes to dipteran Drosophila and mosquitoes. The first mammalian caspase, called
caspase-1 or interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE), was involved in inflammatory response
and at least eight caspases can be activated during apoptosis (Salvesen and Dixit 1997).
Caspases cleave many cellular proteins during apoptosis. They are synthesized as inactive
precursors (procaspases) and their activation is guided by proteolytic cleavage. They are
classified into two categories, the “initiator” and “effector” caspases which include caspases 2,
-4, -5 -8, -9, -10 and -3, -6, -7, respectively. Once activated by autocleavage, an initiator caspase
will activate an effector caspase through cleavage at specific internal aspartic acid (Asp)
residues that separate large and small subunits (Shi 2002). Once activated, the effector caspases
cleave cellular substrates such as actin, nuclear lamin or DNA-dependent protein kinase.
Apoptosis can be triggered by two distinct pathways: one activated by the binding of ligands of
death receptors and generally called “extrinsic” pathway and the second one involving
mitochondria and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins and called “intrinsic” pathway
(Figure 12). However, the two pathways are interconnected by the caspases and share the same
proteins regulated in apoptosis.




-   Death receptors and mitochondrial signaling pathway
Death receptor-mediated apoptosis is activated by stress stimulation sensed by receptors of
the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family including the TNF receptor (TNF-R), TNF-related

                                                                                                  57


apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R) and Fas (also called CD95 or Apo-1). The death
receptor ligands are secreted by immune cells and involved in the control of immune response,
while the receptors can be expressed at the plasma membrane of different cell types. Among
the soluble ligands, the best characterized are members of TFNα, Fas ligand FasL and TNF-
related apoptosis inducing ligand TRAIL. The death receptors are transmembrane proteins,
composed of an extracellular ligand-binding region, a membrane-integrated region, and a
cytoplasmic death domain. The binding of FasL or TRAIL to the extracellular region of death
receptors Fas or TRAIL leads to the oligomerization of the receptor and subsequently to a signal
transduction involving the formation of the multi protein Death-inducing signaling complex
(DISC). DISC includes Fas-associated death domain FADD recruited by the cytoplasmic death
domain region of the receptor, and procaspase-8/10. Caspase-8 is activated by association to
DISC and can activate caspase-3/7. The binding of TNF to TNF-R requires the TRADD
intermediate for the association of FADD and procaspase-8/10. TRADD can also be associated
with RIP1 and TRAF2, leading to the activation of the NF-NB signaling pathway (Muppidi,
Tschopp, and Siegel 2004).




-   Regulation of caspase-mediated apoptosis by the IAP family

The apoptotic pathway is always ready to be activated by the continual expression of
procaspases and the IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) family of proteins is essential for
inhibiting apoptosis in several distinct ways. The IAP proteins contain several BIR domains
(baculovirus IAP-repeat) containing the anti-apoptotic function and one RING domain that
presents a ubiquitin ligase activity. Their function is neutralized by inhibitor molecules, referred
to as IAP-antagonists. The IAP family includes XIAP (X-linked IAP), c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 in
mammals. A high level of IAPs binds to caspase and inhibits caspase-mediated apoptosis: for
example, c-IAP2 and XIAP promote the ubiquitination and degradation of caspase-3/7 (Huang
et al. 2000). The IAP-antagonists can participate in the induction of apoptosis. In mammals, IAP-
antagonists group Smac and HtrA2/Omi and are localized at the mitochondria. They contain an
IAP-binding motif (IBM) conferring the ability to bind physically to IAPs (Figure 12) (Vasudevan
and Ryoo 2015).




                                                                                                 58


In parallel, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis can be activated by caspase-8 in the Fas death
receptor-dependent pathway. It was shown that Bid, localized in the cytoplasm, can be cleaved
by caspase-8 and the truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to the mitochondria, leading to
mitochondrial damage (Li et al. 1998). The damage of the mitochondria is defined by
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) which promotes the release of
cytochrome c, triggering the formation of the multiprotein complex called the apoptosome.
Cytochrome c binds to the apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) which oligomerizes
into the functional complex apoptosome and activates procaspase-9 which in turn activates
caspase-3 (Figure 13), (Xu et al. 2014; Zou et al. 1999).

-    Regulation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by the Bcl-2 family proteins

    The Bcl-2 proteins present either pro- or anti-apoptotic properties and all contain four
conserved bcl-2 homology (BH) motifs (BH-1-BH4) and a TM motif for anchoring to membranes
including mitochondrial membranes, the nuclear envelope, ER, and lysosomes. Understanding
of Bcl-2 proteins is derived from massive investigation in humans, the mouse, the nematode
C.elegans and the fly Drosophila melanogaster. In mammals, the anti-apoptotic proteins include
six proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Bfl1/A1 and Mcl1, while the pro-apoptotic proteins
can be divided into the multi-domain Bax family (Bax, Bak and Bok), and the eight BH3-only
proteins including Bim, Bad, Bid, Noxa and Puma. The Bcl-2 proteins regulate intrinsic apoptosis
through specific binding to the mitochondrial membrane and the final step is the
oligomerization of Bax or Bak (and Bok) at the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the
formation of pores and the release of cytochrome c (Banjara et al. 2020). The anti-apoptotic,
pro-survival, Bcl-2 proteins are associated with the intracellular membrane and their anti-
apoptotic action is antagonized by pro-apoptotic proteins. For example, in C. elegans, the
orthologue of Bcl-2, CED-9, sequesters the Apaf-1 orthologue CED-4 at the mitochondrial
membrane and prevents the activation of caspase CED-3 (Spector et al. 1997). The role of pro-
survival bcl-2 is not limited to apoptosis; indeed, it has been proposed in processes like
autophagy or homeostasis. It has been discovered for instance that the Bcl-2 protein family can
be involved beyond apoptosis in calcium trafficking and metabolite transport across the
mitochondria, which participate in mitochondrial energy metabolism (Danial, Gimenez-Cassina,
and Tondera 2010).

Figure 12: Death receptors- and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in mammals. The
death receptors Fas, TRAIL and TNF form the DISC after binding to their ligands and trigger the
activation of initiator caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 can activate effector caspase-3 and/or
cleave the BH3-only protein Bid. The truncated Bid (tBid) is linked to mitochondria-mediated
apoptosis by the inhibition of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and association with pro-apoptotic Bax and
Bak. The formation of pores in the mitochondria membrane triggers the release of cytochrome
c into the cytoplasm and the formation of the apoptosome through the recruitment of Apaf-1,
dATP and procaspase-9. The initiator caspase-9 is activated by its association with the
apoptosome and upstream by IAP-antagonists released from the mitochondria. Active Caspase-
9 cleaves caspase-3 leading to the degradation of nuclear components like lamin, DNA
fragmentation and cellular skeleton disruption. The apoptotic bodies subsequently formed are
recognized and phagocyted by professional and non-professional cells.


-   p53-mediated apoptosis

Transcriptional factor p53, thoroughly studied in cancerology, is increasingly analyzed in the
fields of virology and immunology for its central role in the transcriptional regulation of
apoptotic and immune response-related genes. Chapter 4 provides a description of p53 and its
interplay with viruses. In this part, the induction of the apoptosis dependent p53 signaling
response will be described. Transcription factor p53 can induce the transcription of apoptotic
genes involved in the intrinsic pathway as well as the extrinsic pathway. For example, after DNA
damage recognition by p53, fas is upregulated transcriptionally as well as trail. Several
members of the Bcl-2 family are targets of p53: bax was the first gene identified and a Bax-

                                                                                             60


deficient mouse exhibited a decrease in p53-mediated apoptosis (Yin et al. 1997). Other pro-
apoptotic targets like Puma, Noxa Bid or Apaf-1 can be p53-upregulated (Moroni et al. 2001;
Oda et al. 2000). Interestingly, the p53 induced transcription of Bid promoted the convergence
of extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.



               3.2.1.2 Regulation of apoptosis during alphavirus infection


During a viral infection, apoptosis is generally described as a defense mechanism induced to
limit virus replication and production and prevent the infection of neighboring cells. On the one
hand, many viruses have developed the capability to delay or inhibit apoptosis either by the
induction of cellular anti-apoptotic proteins or by the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of
their own (Figure 13). On the other hand, it has been shown that apoptosis can be a pro-viral
pathway for replication and dissemination.

The first cell death analysis was documented using SINV and SFV. The infection of baby hamster
kidney (BHK) cells, rat prostatic adenocarcinoma (AT-3) cells and mouse neuroblastoma (N18)
cells with SINV results in apoptosis clearly observable at 24 hpi, resulting in nuclear
condensation and membrane blebbing (Levine et al. 1993). In this same study, they transfected
AT-3 cells with the bcl-2 gene and showed a conversion of lytic SINV infection to persistent
infection, examining the viability and production of viral particles in the supernatant, indicating
the involvement of the mitochondria in SINV-induced apoptosis. Another study demonstrated
that SFV infection of AT-3 cells induces apoptosis and that the overexpression of Bcl-2 led to
cell survival and drastically reduced the percentage of infected cells. They suggested that the
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 function worked at an early stage of SFV infection, participating in the
inhibition of virus replication, however the double positive cells (viral glycoproteins plus bcl-2)
underwent apoptosis later. These results might signify that the restriction of viral replication
and delaying cell death could efficiently infect AT-3 cells and produce new viral particles
(Scallan, Allsopp, and Fazakerley 1997). Lundstrom and colleagues showed that the
overexpression of bcl-2 in rat RIN cells protected the SFV-infected cell from undergoing
apoptosis until 72 hours post-infection (Lundstrom, Pralong, and Martinou 1997). Another
study confirmed the synthesis of bcl-2 during the early stages of SFV infection and that no
apoptotic cells were detected at those time points. Moreover, bcl-2 expression in BHK-21 and

                                                                                                61


AT-3 cells did not confer protection at later time points and the infection did not lead to
cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. They concluded that cell death during SFV
infection in BHK-21 and AT-3 cells was not triggered by the ‘intrinsic’ pathway of apoptosis
(Kiiver, Merits, and Sarand 2008). Finally, more recently, Urban and colleagues demonstrated
that SFV infection led to apoptosis that did not require TRAIL or TNF-mediated signaling, but
mitochondrial Bak leading to cytochrome c release and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-
3 (Urban et al. 2008). Interestingly, they demonstrated that among BH3-only proteins, only Bid
was associated with SFV-induced cell death, given that caspase-8 and Bid cleavage occurred
downstream of Bak. They suggested that Bid cleavage served to amplify the induction of
apoptosis during SFV infection.
Taken together, these studies using SFV revealed that cells infected by SFV undergo apoptosis,
however it remains controversial as to which signaling pathways lead to host cell death. We
suggest that these differences in conclusions could come from the mammal cell lines and the
viral molecular approaches used. Moreover, we propose that finally both intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways are involved during SFV infection.


The in vivo mouse infection of VEEV is associated with cell death in the brain, demonstrated by
the TUNEL assay (DNA fragmentation) and morphological changes (Jackson and Rossiter 1997).
Finally, when mice were infected with SINV, the apoptotic cells were detected principally in the
brain and contained viral antigens, suggesting that apoptosis was triggered in virus-infected
cells (Lewis et al. 1996).

The role of caspases in alphaviruse-induced apoptosis has been investigated. Nava and
colleagues showed in BHK cells infected by SINV, that the activation of caspases results in the
cleavage of the intracellular target PARP (Poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase) at 24 hpi, which is
involved in DNA repair. Then, using zVAD-FMK pan-caspase inhibitor, they showed a decrease
in SINV-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Using a more specific inhibitor, CrmA,
which inhibits more specifically caspase-8 and caspase-1 (involved in IL-1β production) they
obtained the same result, suggesting the involvement of caspase-1 or caspase-8 in SINV-
induced apoptosis maybe through the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP (Nava et al.
1998). Another team showed that the cleavage of PARP-1 was detected at 20-24 hpi and the
cleavage of caspase-3 at 16-20 hpi in mouse primary fibroblasts infected by SINV. These results

demonstrate that PARP-1 activity ceased immediately after caspase-3 activation, reinforcing
the previous result (Nargi-Aizenman et al. 2002). Finally, the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-
SY5Y is permissive to CHIKV (Solignat et al. 2009) and presents several apoptotic features
starting between 24-36 hpi (Dhanwani et al. 2012): the detection of CHIKV glycoprotein E1 and
cytochrome c translocation to cytoplasm at 16hpi followed by the detection of cleaved caspase-
3 and cleaved-PARP at 24 and 36hpi. In parallel, a decrease of Bcl-2 from 36 to 48hpi was
detected. The morphological changes and viability of CHIKV infected cells are associated with
apoptotic protein activation with complete cell death between 36 and 48hpi. The infection is
also accompanied by a significant alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and
an elevation of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) evaluated by an increase of Glutathione (GSH)
level at 36 and 48 hpi. GSH is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein with one part anchored
in the mitochondria while the other is cytoplasmic. GSH is involved in mitochondrial cell death
and, interestingly, it has been shown that the origin of the cytotoxicity and kinetics of GSH
depletion and S-glutathionylation (formation of protein-GSH mixed disulfides) could determine
whether cells undergo apoptosis or necrosis (Di Stefano et al. 2006). This result suggested that
the involvement of ROS through an elevation of GSH could determine if a cell undergoes
apoptosis or necrosis during CHIKV infection and maybe by other alphaviruses. The other cell
death pathways such as necroptosis and pyroptosis will not be presented and discussed in this
manuscript by choice, however some studies have shown their induction in the context of
certain RNA virus infections and have raised many new and fascinating questions (Kaczmarek,
Vandenabeele, and Krysko 2013).

To conclude this section, the infection of different cell lines with different alphaviruses seems
to lead to the late induction of apoptosis involving the mitochondria earlier and the caspases of
extrinsic and/or intrinsic apoptosis afterwards.

The dynamics of the mitochondria is considerably altered during apoptosis, and the infection of
human astrocytoma cells U87MG by VEEV results in the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential at 6 hpi accompanied by an increase of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) inducing a
cytopathicity impact of VEEV infection. In parallel, the infection of C6/36 mosquito cells reveals
a less susceptible mitochondrial dysfunction at 6hpi. The viral capsid of VEEV in U87MG cells is
localized at the mitochondria which starts to become fragmented and presents a perinuclear
accumulation (Keck et al. 2017). Several virulent factors have been described as associated with
the mitochondria and inducing apoptosis. For example, the NSs of the Rift Valley Fever virus
(RVFV) was detected in the mitochondria of infected hepatic HepG2 cells, contributing to ROS
accumulation, and the ROS levels were correlated with the activation of NF-κB and p53
responses. ROS accumulation contributes to innate immune response and apoptosis through
the activation of the host signaling response such as NF-κB and AP-1. (Narayanan et al. 2014).
In this study, NF-κB /p65 activation occurred earlier than p53 and an increase of the pro-
apoptotic Noxa p53-target gene has been shown.



                                                                                               64


Interestingly, the mitochondrial induction of caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation was
demonstrated in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human HeLa cells infected with SFV.
Previously, it has been shown that Bax/Bak were efficient for apoptosis induction during SFV
infection, however cells lacking Bax/Bak continue to die in a caspase-dependent manner. It has
also been demonstrated that caspase-8 with MAVS anchors directly on the mitochondria in a
FADD-dependent manner, without the activation of TNF-associated proteins and or an effect
on MOMP. In this context, the activation of caspase-8 and 3 was very fast (detectable at 8 hpi).
Moreover, caspase-8 and MAVS-deficient MEFs cells delayed cell death but were not protected
from caspase-3 activation, suggesting another SFV-induced caspase-3 activation. It was only
when Bax/Bak were knocked out that the depletion of caspase-8 and MAVs induced a
protective effect against SFV-induced cell death (El Maadidi et al. 2014). Thus, these results
showed that the mitochondrion was involved in SFV-induced cell death and the absence of
MOMP could be explained by the timing of the analysis.



Macrophages and monocytes are believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of
alphavirus-mediated arthritis. Krejbich-Trotot and colleagues evaluated the permissiveness and
cellular response of a human monocyte acute leukemia MM6 cell line infected by Ross River
virus (RRV). After the infection of MM6 cells with MOI 1, growth kinetics was detected every
day until 7 days of infection and the virus titer increased slightly between 1 to 3 dpi with a
maximum of 103 PFU/ml (compared to 108PFU/ml in VeroE6 or HEK-293 cell lines) and
decreased to 100 PFU/ml after 3dpi. Surprisingly, the very low replication and production rate
of RRV was not associated with the control of viral infection by Type-I interferon production
and cytokine expression. At day 5, MM6 infected cells underwent apoptosis with Bax
mitochondrial localization and cleavage of PARP. Moreover, the few cells rescued from
apoptosis presented a viral genome analyzed by RT-qPCR for up to 45 days (Krejbich-Trotot et
al. 2016). These results indicated that RRV can persistently infect monocytes. Moreover, the
very late apoptosis induction suggests that in the absence of apoptosis the cells were still
infected without inflammatory response. This cellular condition could participate in the chronic
form of RRV and maybe other arthritogenic-alphaviruses. For CHIKV, it is still poorly understood
what promotes the persistent infection of CHIKV in muscles. Recently, it has been shown that
CHIKV infection of mouse muscle induced arthritis during the chronic phase and presented a

                                                                                             65


weak level of viral RNA in myofibers, dermal and muscle fibroblasts for at least 16 weeks after
infection. However, after 7 dpi, viral RNA drastically decreased and the subgenomic promoter
was active only during the first week (acute and post-acute phases). The chronic phase
presented several characteristics of arthritis and these results seem to indicate that genomic
RNA coding for non-structural proteins participates in the induction of the chronic phase.
However, the signals that switch off non-structural protein translation on the genomic RNA are
still unknown. During the chronic phase it has been demonstrated that the cellular populations
positive to CHIKV detection are the skin fibroblasts, skeletal muscle cells and synovial tissues
(Young et al. 2019). These results indicate that a subset of infected cells survive CHIKV infection,
i.e. they were not killed or did not succumb to lytic infection. However, the mechanism that
protects these infected cells from cell death, and how they can become chronically infected, is
still unknown. The non-translation of subgenomic RNA coding for nucleocapsid and structural
proteins could participate in the persistence of viral RNA and subsequently in chronicity. To
conclude, we propose that the non-structural proteins of CHIKV are involved in the control of
cell death during the chronic phase.

In addition, it has been shown that CHIKV RNA were found adjacent to the periosteum
(membrane that covers the outer surface of bones) and it has been suggested that fibroblasts
and osteoclasts could be the positive population of CHIKV RNA. As has been suggested, the
infection of osteoclasts can perturbate the function of these cells which could also explain the
histological damage observed. However, it is still unknown what promotes these symptoms
during the chronic phase. Whereas chronic inflammation has been clearly identified in this
tissue, viral replication has not been detected, but the presence of CHIKV RNA in in vivo mice
has been demonstrated. Additional studies on apoptotic features in these survival populations
of cells could contribute to better understanding of the mechanism in long-term pathogenesis
and could contribute to the development of treatments. However, it seems that using only an
in vitro system will not be sufficient and rodent and non-human primate (NHPs) models are
necessary to consider the complex environment of joints and muscles. The study of CHIKV
pathogenesis in NHP hosts could be very interesting (Broeckel et al. 2015; Higgs and Ziegler
2010).

The induction of apoptosis seems to occur principally at the beginning of infection in in vitro
systems. However, the first cycle of alphavirus replication occurs around six hours after entry,

                                                                                                 66


indicating that apoptosis is not induced between 6 and 20 hours of infection. This observation
could indicate that apoptosis must be inhibited or delayed in different ways to allow viral
replication and escape from antiviral response. Several associated pathways can delay and
crosstalk with apoptosis, like autophagy, cell death inducers (RE stress, oxidative stress) and
the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Moreover, it seems important to discuss the activity of nsP2 presented previously, regarding
the general transcriptional shut-off of infected cells from 6-8 hours post infection. Indeed, it
has been shown that the transfection of CHIKV nsP2 in VeroE6 led to significant cytopathic
effects (CPE) and the mutation of nsP2 NLS abrogated the inhibition of the antiviral interferon
JAK-STAT pathway, whereas combined mutation in NLS and a conserved proline P718S allows
a non-cytopathic RNA replicon (Fros et al. 2013). The nsP2 of alphaviruses presents multiple
activities involved in RNA replication, the inhibition of innate immune response through the
JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and it participates to a large extent in the cytopathic effects.

In conclusion, Alphavirus infection induces extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic cell death.
Moreover, viral proteins may control apoptosis and connect signaling pathways such as
endoplasmic reticulum stress, the transcription pathway, and oxidative stress in order to
produce new virions. Lastly, the control of cell death and immune response could influence the
mechanism involved in alphaviral persistence.



              3.2.1.3 Apoptosis-autophagy balance and crosstalk with other pathways


Joubert and colleagues have shown a cross talk between apoptosis and autophagy pathways
where autophagy can play a pro- or anti-viral role during CHIKV infection.
Briefly, autophagy is a degradative system that controls the clearance and recycling of cellular
constituents. It is initiated by the formation of a double-membrane (phagophore) that requires
elongation and maturation in vesicles called autophagosome. The autophagosomes sequester
cytoplasmic constituents and organelles, which are degraded by hydrolytic enzymes after fusion
between autophagosomes and lysosomes (forming the autophagolysosome). Figure 14
presents an overview of the autophagy pathway and proteins involved in the mechanism.



                                                                                               67


Figure 14: An overview of the autophagy pathway in mammals. Autophagy (also called
macroautophagy) is initiated by the recognition of cargo molecules in the cell thanks to target-
specific autophagy receptors such as p62 and NDP52 with PE LC3-II, leading to the formation
of membranes from the Endoplasmic reticulum which involves Beclin-1. The formation,
elongation, and maturation of the autophagosome require several Atg proteins (Atg5, Atg12,
etc.). Following closure, the autophagosome is transported by the microtubule, leading to its
fusion with lysosomes, forming the autolysosome. Fusion in mammal cells requires LAMP-2 and
Rab proteins such as Rab5 and Rab7 (not presented in the figure). Next, the acidification of the
autolysosome allows the action of hydrolytic enzymes, the hydrolases. The sequestered
materials are degraded into amino acids or fatty acids and transported back to the cytoplasm
for reuse in cellular metabolic processes. PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; LAMP-2:Lysosomal-
associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (Adapted from Kocaturk and Gozuacik 2018)



The induction of autophagy has been demonstrated during several alphavirus infections such
as SINV, SFV and CHIKV. During the CHIKV infection of the HEK293 cell line, which stably
expressed LC3-GFP, an accumulation of GFP-LC3-postive puncta from 4 to 48 hpi was shown.
The induction of autophagic flux by Rapamycin pretreatment increased the number of infected
cells and viral RNA in the supernatant of cells. However, the inhibition of autophagic flux by
treatment with 3-MA or by transfection of siRNA beclin-1 led to a significant decrease of CHIKV
RNA production in the supernatant and number of infected cells (Krejbich-Trotot, Gay, et al.
2011). These results indicate that autophagy is induced early in viral infection (4hpi) and could
be required for effective CHIK replication. Another study, following the CHIKV infection of HeLa
cells showed an increase in LC3-II expression and a decrease of p62 receptors from 15 to 24hpi,
indicating an enhancement of autophagic flux. In parallel, the depletion of beclin-1, Atg6 and 7
and p62 is associated with an increase of virus-induced cell death. Moreover, in CHIKV infected
HeLa and primary human labial fibroblasts (HLFs) it was shown that p62 colocalized with

                                                                                              68


ubiquitinated viral capsid and LAMP1 (receptors of lysosomes) and resulted in an autophagy-
mediated antiviral response, whereas CHIKV nsP2 can interact with NDP52 next to the
replication complex and could promote viral replication (Judith et al. 2013), (Figure 15).




Figure 15: Dual effect of p62 and NDP52 on CHIKV capsid and nsP2 during autophagic
flux. NDP52 can interact with nsP2 and participate in viral replication while p62 interacts with

protein 3B and 3C; ER: Endoplasmic Reticulum; TGN: Trans Golgi network; NDP52: nuclear

Additional results following SINV infection in mice have shown that the inhibition of neuronal
Atg5 resulted in increased mortality. It has been suggested that p62 can interact with the viral
capsid, promoting the clearance of the latter through the autophagy pathway, which could be
important for the survival of infected cells (Orvedahl et al. 2010).

There is evidence that points either to an anti-viral or a pro-viral role of autophagy during
alphavirus infection. Therefore, apoptosis and autophagy are two crosstalk pathways that also
communicate with other signaling pathways. The hypothesis that apoptosis could be delayed
at the early stage of CHIKV infection by anti-apoptotic pathways has been put forward by some
teams. Abraham and colleagues investigated the crosstalk of pathways in U-87 MG cells

                                                                                             69


infected by CHIKV. From 48 to 96hpi, they showed apoptotic induction by the loss of MMP,
PARP-1 cleavage and DNA fragmentation in dose-dependent CHIKV. Before apoptosis, at 24hpi
autophagy was triggered and earlier, at 12hpi, the activation of ER stress was identified by the
detection of unconventional splicing of the X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1). During ER stress,
the global shut-off of the cell can be regulated by the phosphorylation level of initiation factor
eIF2α from 24 to 72hpi. The eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2α can in turn regulate mRNA
translation and it has been shown that the activation of eIF2α increases at 72 hpi. (Abraham et
al. 2013). To conclude, autophagy and ER stress occurring during the CHIKV infection of U-87
MG cells could delay apoptosis and subsequently induce efficient viral replication.

Joubert et al. also showed that during CHIKV infection of human and mouse cells and in vivo
mouse, autophagy was triggered by ER and oxidative stress, delaying the induction of apoptosis.
ER stress was regulated by the phosphorylation of Inositol-requiring transmembrane
endoribonuclease 1 α (IRE1α). IRE1α is present in the ER membrane and transduces the signal
of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR response is involved in CHIKV infection and
can be disabled by nsP2 mediated-shut off (Fros et al. 2015; Khongwichit et al. 2016). IRE1α was
activated by phosphorylation (p-IRE1α), and during CHIKV infection p-IRE1α was detected
during the early phase of infection with an increase between 4 to 24hpi. The kinetics of IRE1α
phosphorylation correlated with the induction of LC3-II. Finally, the production of ROS during
CHIKV seemed to participate in CHIKV-induced autophagy and both ER and ROS could be
essential for the induction of autophagy. Finally, in CHIKV infected-human HFF Atg5-/- the
percentage of cleaved-caspase-3 increased, whereas in MEFs bax-/-, bak-/- the percentage of
cleaved caspase-3 decreased drastically 24 hours after infection. These results confirm first,
that extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis are activated and, second, demonstrate the antiapoptotic
function of autophagy during CHIKV infection (P. E. Joubert et al. 2012), (Figure 16).

CHIKV infection in mammals (Adapted from Joubert et al. 2012).


Another interesting analysis showed a pro-viral effect of apoptosis influencing CHIKV infection
of through the detection of viral particles in apoptotic bodies. Indeed, CHIKV infection of HeLa
cells and primary fibroblasts led to the detection of viral particles in apoptotic blebs during
apoptosis and demonstrated the ability of infected apoptotic bodies to infect neighboring non-
infected cells through the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies containing CHIKV particles. More
interestingly, the apoptotic blebs containing CHIKV were capable of infecting and replicating in
macrophages,    previously shown to be refractory to infection, without inducing a pro-
inflammatory response (Krejbich-Trotot, Denizot, et al. 2011).



Finally, another strategy has been developed by several different enveloped viruses employing
apoptosis features. At the late stage of apoptosis, the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells
exposes a marker recognized by macrophages for the engulfment of apoptotic blebs, named
phosphatidylserine (PS). The PS is recognized by PS receptors belonging to the TIM1, TIM4 and

                                                                                             71


TAM (Axl, Tyro3 and Mer) families. In viable cells, the PS are retained on the cytoplasmic side
by flippases, and during apoptosis the distribution of phospholipids is disrupted, resulting in the
externalization of PS guided by scramblases (Hankins et al. 2015). The budding of new viral
particles at the plasma membrane can lead to the passive distribution of PS, in the absence of
flippases, between the inner and outer part of the membrane. Consequently, the new virions
present PS at the outer leaflet of their membranes, leading to the binding to nonspecific
receptors and uptake of the virus, for example, by macropinocytosis, allowing the infection to
hijack the innate immune system. This mechanism has been named “apoptotic mimicry” and
was discovered for different virus genera such as alphaviruses (EEEV, RRV, CHIKV and SINV),
flaviviruses (DENV, WNV, Yellow fever virus YFV), polyomavirus SV40, vesiculovirus VSV,
ebolavirus EBOV and Marburgvirus MARV (Amara and Mercer 2015).

               3.2.2.1 The apoptotic pathway in Drosophila and Aedes


Apoptosis in insects has been well characterized and described thanks to in vivo genetic
manipulation of the fly Drosophila melanogaster. As in vertebrates, cell death in invertebrates
plays important roles during the development of the embryo and in the adult, in the
homeostasis of tissues and during pathogen infections (Mollereau 2009). Apoptosis in
Drosophila is also controlled by initiator and effector caspases that are expressed ubiquitously
and synthesized as inactive procaspases negatively regulated by members of the Drosophila IAP
(DIAP) family (Hay and Guo 2006). Based on sequence homology with Drosophila genes involved
in apoptosis, numerous genes presumed to regulate apoptosis have been identified in other
insects, like the mosquito Aedes (Bryant et al. 2008; Liu and Clem 2011). In Drosophila, the
expression of the DIAP antagonist reaper, hid and grim (RHG) induces the inhibition of DIAP1
and subsequently caspase-9 orthologue Dronc activation (Figure 17). It has been shown that
the inhibition of DIAP1 is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in fly cells compared to mammal cells
(Vasudevan and Ryoo 2015). In Aedes homologues of IAP-antagonists have been characterized
named Michelob_x and IMP which induce the activation of AeDronc (Wang and Clem 2011).
The activation of initiator caspases leads to the activation of effector DrICE in Drosophila and

AeDrICE or Aecasp7 in the mosquito (Feng et al. 2016) (Figure 17). Controversy exists regarding
the role of the Drosophila mitochondria in apoptosis. On the one hand, Ark apoptosome
formation is required for the induction of apoptosis, without cytochrome c (Zimmermann et al.
2002). On the other hand, it has been shown that caspase activation occurs at the mitochondrial
level and includes RHG proteins and proteins of the Bcl-2 family (Clavier et al. 2016).




Figure 17: Comparison between the apoptotic pathway in Drosophila, Aedes and

homologues of Apaf-1 in mammals, promote the activation of initiators caspase Dronc and
AaDronc (homologue of caspase-9). The inhibitor DIAP1 in Drosophila and AeIAP1 can
negatively regulate the activity of the initiator caspase and subsequently the effector caspases
DrICE and AeDrICE or Aecasp7. Several antagonists of IAP in Drosophila have been described,
Reaper, Hid and Grim and two in Aedes, called Michelob_X and IMP, and can be p53 target
genes.

function of the vector-virus has been described previously. Apoptosis is another known efficient
antiviral response in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, it seems that apoptosis is not
always antiviral and can be used by some viruses using caspase cleavage for their own viral
replication (Richard and Tulasne 2012) or for dissemination using apoptotic bodies.



               3.2.2.2 The effect of apoptosis on arbovirus outcome


In this part we present the significance of apoptosis during the arbovirus infection of permissive
and resistant mosquitoes and the opposite conclusion about the role of apoptosis in
determining vector competence.

Regarding the lack of tools for studying apoptosis in the mosquito, two different approaches
using SINV/Ae.aegypti have been developed through the sequencing and annotation of the
Aedes aegypti genome and the well conserved protein function between Drosophila and Aedes
(Bryant et al. 2008).




-   Effect of apoptosis inhibition or induction on virus outcome


The first approach used RNAi to inhibit or induce apoptosis during SINV infection and the second
one by the engineering expression of pro-apoptotic genes in the SINV genome.
In the former approach, Wang and colleagues showed that silencing Aeiap1 by the injection of
dsRNA in Ae. aegypti increased the mortality of mosquitoes and increased the apoptotic level
detected by caspase activity. The activity of caspase was higher in the midgut of Aeiap1 dsRNA
than in the rest of the mosquito (carcass). The mortality rate can be rescued by silencing
Aedronc. Then, they analyzed the impact of inducing or inhibiting apoptosis on the SINV-GFP
escape barrier. They showed a higher GFP intensity in the midgut of Aeiap1 dsRNA mosquitoes
than in control and a lower GFP intensity in the midgut of Aedronc dsRNA mosquitoes,
suggesting that the activation of caspase increased viral replication in the midgut while the
inhibition of caspase activation decreased SINV replication. Moreover, Aedronc infected-
mosquitos presented a lower rate of SINV dissemination in their salivary glands, suggesting that
the inhibition of apoptosis by silencing caspase Dronc decreased dissemination from the midgut


                                                                                               74


(Wang et al. 2012). It seems that a caspase activity is required for the dissemination of SINV
from the midgut to the secondary organs and could participate in the remodeling of the basal
lamina. It was previously demonstrated that caspase activity in a baculovirus-infected
lepidopteran host induced the remodeling of the basal lamina and facilitated dissemination
across the midgut barrier (Means and Passarelli 2010). These first studies seem to indicate that
apoptosis does not present an antiviral effect on SINV. However, the injection of dsRNA in
whole mosquito affects the apoptosis pathway in a nonspecific manner (infected or not by
SINV), and it could be a bias in a context of arbovirus infection.


Another study, during the DENV infection of permissive and refractory (Midgut Infection Barrier
MIB profile, cf. Figure 7) Aedes aegypti, showed an increase of initiator Aedronc and Aedredd
(orthologue caspase-8) and effector Aecaspase16 expression at 24 and 36 hours post-infection
in the midguts of DENV-MIB refractory mosquitoes compared to DENV-infected permissive
mosquitoes. A drastic decrease of caspase expression was detected after 48 hours in DENV-
MIB. The authors then analyzed the effects of RNAi knockdown of Aedronc and Aecaspase16
on DENV development in DENV-MIB refractory mosquitoes. The knockdown of initiator Aedronc
but not Aecaspase16 increased the development of DENV in infected MIB-mosquitoes at day
13 (Ocampo et al. 2013). Taken together, it seems that Dronc activity is important in SINV and
DENV infection and could be involved in midgut infection and/or the midgut escape barrier.


It seems be more relevant to analyze the role of apoptosis only in infected cells, and moreover
it was previously reported that only a small number of epithelial cells were infected by
arbovirus, suggesting that the manipulation of whole mosquitoes in a non- tissue-specific
manner could induce a misleading interpretation.
In the second approach, the engineering of pro-apoptotic genes directly in the SINV genome is
a solution to analyze the role of apoptosis only in infected cells (O’Neill et al. 2015). In this
study, they cloned the pro-apoptotic protein Reaper (DIAP antagonist) from Drosophila
(SINV/reaper) in the SINV genome to examine the ability of SINV to infect Aedes aegypti in vivo
after the induction of apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis in the midgut of infected
mosquitoes has been detected by the TUNEL assay and effector caspase-7 orthologue activity.
At 3 days post-bloodmeal infection, the area of infection in the SINV/reaper mosquito was
lower than in infected control and at 5 and 7 dpi, the area of infection in the midgut was not

                                                                                              75


different between the SINV/reaper and SINV control mosquitoes. The same results were
obtained by achieving viral replication and dissemination in the carcass of infected mosquitoes.
These results suggested that the expression of reaper in infected cells delays viral replication at
the initial stage of infection but does not avoid the dissemination from the midgut. The analysis
of the amount of virus in the saliva of infected mosquitoes also showed a delay in SINV
replication at 10 dpi but no differences at 14dpi. Finally, the SINV/reaper infected mosquitoes
presented a lower survival rate than SINV infected control mosquitoes. Moreover, nucleotide
sequencing of SINV/reaper infected mosquitoes showed rapid and strong selection against the
maintenance of Reaper expression.


In addition to these two approaches, another study was conducted, based on the expression of
the Culicoides Inhibitor Apoptosis Protein (CsIAP) from C. sonorensis cells in mammalian cells
before Bluetongue BTV virus infection. The stable expression of CsIAP in the BSR mammal cell
line suppressed apoptosis induced by BTV infection and the same result was obtained after
infection with African horse sickness virus AHSV (another arbovirus of the genus Orbivirius).
They indicated that CsIAP was an inhibitor of mammalian caspase-9 and then suggested that
the suppression of apoptosis in insect cells could involve a caspase-9 homologue (Vermaak,
Maree, and Theron 2017). Previously, another study showed that the expression of Aedes
albopictus IAP1 in BTV-infected BHK cells delayed BTV-induced apoptosis for 24 hours and
decreased virus production (Li et al. 2007). These results suggested that arbovirus-induced
mammal cell death can be controlled and inhibited, participating in the persistence of the virus
in mammal cells. Moreover, we wonder whether the virus could block IAPs in the insect vector
and in the mammal host. Interestingly, African Swine Fever virus (ASFV) was revealed to encode
a homologue of IAP that promotes cell survival and is able to activate the transcription of NF-
κB in human Jurkat cells, allowing the modulation of immune response; moreover, NF-κB can
inhibit apoptosis by the transcription of antiapoptotic genes such as IAP or Bcl-2 (Rodríguez et
al. 2002). These results suggested an important role of IAPs in the host and vector in controlling
cell fate and it could be interesting to overexpress mammalian IAPs in cells infected by
arbovirus, inducing the lytic cycle, to see if mammalian IAP is sufficient to block apoptosis
through initiator caspases.

Taken together, these results suggest that the induction of apoptosis during infection plays an
anti-viral defense role and that arbovirus could have evolved mechanisms to avoid the
induction of apoptosis in natural vectors.


-   Rapid and long-term effect of cell death in determining vector competence

In a permissive (susceptible) infected mosquito, the cellular response in the initial stage of
infection in the midgut seems important and even decisive for vector competence.
Vaidyanathan and Scott examined the midgut epithelial cells of laboratory refractory Culex
pipiens pipiens infected by WNV at 3 days post-feeding (Vaidyanathan and Scott 2006).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed cellular changes consistent with apoptosis
such as chromatin condensation, the detachment of cells and the engulfment of apoptotic
bodies by neighboring cells. Moreover, the cytoplasm and vesicles in the apoptotic cells were
positive for virion detection. To analyze the dissemination of WNV in the mosquito, the viral
titer of WNV fed Culex was detected at 7- and 10-days post feeding, and no mosquito was
detected positive (Vaidyanathan and Scott 2006). Unfortunately, the midgut epithelial cells of
susceptible strains were not examined. These results suggest that apoptosis is associated with
WNV infection and the midgut infection barrier but did not allow concluding that apoptosis
contributes to resistance.

The infection of susceptible and less susceptible Culex tarsalis strains with Western Equine
Encephalomyelitis virus (WEEV) showed that the infection of susceptible strains causes
pathology in the midgut epithelium between 2- and 4-days post feeding detected by sloughed
cells in the lumen. Moreover, in situ, necrotic cell death was detected in the more susceptible
strain and not in the less susceptible and control strains (Weaver, Lorenz, and Scott 1992).
Another study reported cytopathologic lesions in epithelial cells of the midgut of mosquito
Culiseta orally infected with Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV) at 3 days post
feeding. The degeneration of midgut epithelial cells was accompanied by the disruption of
basal lamina. They suggested that EEEV virus-associated pathologic changes promote
dissemination to secondary organs (Weaver et al. 1988).

More recently, a midgut transcriptome analysis of Aedes aegypti fed with CHIKV has shown
increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) associated with a decrease of the basal
lamina component collagen IV between 20-48 hours post infection (Dong, Behura, and Franz

                                                                                            77


2017). The remodeling of the basal lamina could participate in the midgut escape barrier.
However, the MMP could have a proapoptotic effect (Tamura et al. 2004) and activate the
effector caspase (Means and Passarelli 2010), thus it is tempting to combine the apoptotic
effect and/or caspase activity on MMP in midgut barrier escape.

The detection of arbovirus in salivary glands in laboratory conditions occurred between 10- and
14-days post feeding. Structural pathology in the salivary glands of Ae albopictus
intrathoracically inoculated with SINV at 10 days post-infection was reported (Bowers,
Coleman, and Brown 2003) and apoptotic TUNEL positive cells in the lateral lobes of the salivary
gland where SINV were detected but not in the median lobe (Kelly, Moon, and Bowers 2012). It
has been shown that SINV can infect the lateral lobe but does not seem to infect the median
lobe of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus (Bowers et al. 1995; Gaidamovich et al. 1973). The
dissemination of WNV to the salivary glands of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus was revealed at
14 days post infection and the WNV-induced pathology detected at 14, 21 and up to 25 days
post infection (Girard et al. 2006). In another study, they showed that the long-term infection
of salivary glands was still associated with apoptosis and decreased virus release into saliva.
They hypothesized that salivary gland pathology induced by WNV could affect the feeding
behavior of mosquitoes and subsequently transmission (Girard et al. 2007).


To conclude, it seems that the cell death could be involved during the infection of the insect
vector and could have a pro- and/or an anti- viral effect, maybe depending on the timing and
the organ infected. As it is known that arboviruses cause persistent infection with no cytopathic
effects in the insect vector, the pathology of the mosquito for instance, may not have been
sufficiently investigated. Studies presenting the permissiveness and resistance of vectors have
shown the increasing complexity of virus-insect interactions.


-   Cellular factors involved in cell death regulation
Quite recently, using an in vivo Drosophila model, a team identified that the injection of
Drosophila with baculovirus Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus
(AcMNPV) and Flock House virus (FHV) rapidly induced (1 hour post injection) the upregulation
of hid and reaper in the gut and fat body. The infection of the Drosophila DL-1 cell line showed
the same results at 24 and 36 hpi. Because reaper and hid are p53-target genes, they injected


                                                                                              78


viruses in Drosophila p53-/- mutants and first observed a decrease of the target genes reaper
and hid and indirect apoptotic features with the activation of caspase Dronc. The inhibition of
apoptosis has been associated with an increase of viral infection and the necrotic evolution of
infected cells at 4-7 days post injection. They suggested that a rapid induction of apoptosis p53-
dependent as an innate immune response could be associated with the susceptibility and
resistance of arbovirus infections in their vector. To investigate this hypothesis, they infected
susceptible and resistant laboratory strains of Aedes aegypti with DENV and identified an
increase of Michelob_mx mRNA at 3 and 18 hours post blood meal in resistant mosquito but
not in susceptible mosquitoes (Liu et al. 2013). However, the signal responsible for p53
activation during arbovirus infection was not elucidated.

Finally, alphaviruses cause significant cytopathic effects in vertebrate cells. The hypothesis that
host transcriptional shut-off is linked to the cytopathicity and/or cell death of alphavirus
infections is still misunderstood. Interestingly, in the mosquito, alphavirus infection is not
associated with RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1 homologue degradation. It has been shown
that SINV infection does not induce the degradation of the RPB1 homologue in mosquito cells,
suggesting that viral infection does not induce transcriptional shut-off as in vertebrate cells (I.
Akhrymuk et al. 2012).



-   Oxidative stress response
During arbovirus infection, oxidative stress was detected in both mammalian and insect cells.
In insects, oxidative stress is defined as the loss of homeostasis between the accumulation of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the production of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide
dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) or glutathione transferase and reductase (Felton and Summers
1995). During blood feeding, the midgut is in contact with sugar, iron, heme and other
components of vertebrate blood and mosquitoes have evolved a protective adaptation against
damage caused by heme and iron uptake. Indeed, heme can induce lipid peroxidation, protein
degradation and ultimately cell death. Once in the epithelial cells, these components are
detoxified, and a strong antioxidant and protective response is engaged (Whiten, Eggleston,
and Adelman 2018). Concomitantly, pathogens present in the blood could take advantage of
this antioxidant response, blocking cell death, to infect and replicate into midgut epithelial cells.
To test the hypothesis that arbovirus infection and subsequently vector competence could be

                                                                                                  79


influenced by the antioxidant response of blood feeding, Henrique and colleagues performed
catalase knockdown in Aedes aegypti and infected them with DENV and ZIKV. The RNAi-
mediated knockdown of catalase challenged with H2O2 resulted in the reduced lifespan of
mosquitoes and oviposition. Then, the incapacity of ROS degradation after H2O2 treatment
reduced the ability of DENV to infect the midgut of Ae. aegypti but curiously not that of Zika
virus (Henrique et al. 2017). The same result was obtained in Anopheles gambiae infected with
the parasite Plasmodium falciparum: by reducing mitochondrial ROS generation in the midgut,
they observed an increase in mosquito susceptibility to the malaria parasite (Gonçalves et al.
2012). A proteomic approach was used to characterize several protein modifications in the
midgut of Aedes aegypti infected by DENV and CHIKV seven days after oral infection
(Tchankouo-Nguetcheu et al. 2010). The CHIKV infection induced an increase in the protein
expression involved in detoxification, and both viruses increased proteins involved in
antioxidant response but not the same. Taken together, these results suggest that the oxidative
response first induces a protective response in favor of virus infection and, second, the
responses in the midgut of the mosquito is not similar in virus/mosquito combinations.
Interestingly, oxidative stress in mammals can lead to the post-translational modification of
p53, leading to the regulation of genes involved either in survival or in cell death (Liu, Chen, and
St. Clair 2008).


-   Apoptosis-Autophagy crosstalk during arbovirus infection of the mosquito
The well conserved autophagic flux between vertebrates and invertebrates allows analyzing
insect autophagy-arbovirus interactions for the first time in a useful Drosophila organism. The
first studies identified the ortholog adapter protein p62 in the insect called ref(2)p and showed
that the ref(2)p null allele mutant renders sigma virus (which is not an arbovirus, family:
Rhabdoviridae) infection in Drosophila permissive, suggesting an anti-viral response
(Contamine, Petitjean, and Ashburner 1989). While Drosophila is neither hematophagous nor a
natural vector of arboviruses, it provides very useful information thanks to easier genetical
manipulation compared to Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.

The in vivo genetic model Drosophila has been used as an insect model for SINV analysis. It has
been shown that the over-expression or inhibition of the Akt-mTOR pathway (involved in the
negative regulation of autophagy) in flies, increases or decreases SINV replication, respectively.
In parallel, SINV infection of Drosophila cells led to the phosphorylation of Akt and its activation.
                                                                                                  80


Moreover, using an Aedes albopictus mosquito C636 cell line, the chemical inhibition of Akt and
TOR induced a decrease in viral replication and viral particle production. It was shown that the
pathway was in fact involved in the control of the invertebrate cellular cap-dependent
translation pathway as a survival response and further investigations were needed to
characterize the regulation of autophagy (Patel and Hardy 2012).

Using a natural vector, the infection of Aedes aegypti with DENV resulted in the induction of
autophagy and apoptosis while the knockdown of Aedronc decreased DENV infection (Eng, van
Zuylen, and Severson 2016). The role of caspase Aedronc in viral infection has been described
previously with DENV and SINV by Ocampo et al (2013) and O’Neill et al (2015), respectively.
Eng et al also showed that in the midgut of resistant mosquitoes, DENV infection led to the
upregulation of Aedronc, AeIAP1 and Mx at 48 hours post blood meal compared to the midgut
of susceptible mosquitoes. In parallel, in whole resistant mosquitoes infected by DENV,
autophagy genes (Atg1, Atg5, Atg8, Atg12) were upregulated from 24 to 60-72 hours post blood
meal and autophagosome biogenesis was confirmed. More interestingly, several other
apoptosis-related genes were transcriptionally activated during autophagy, like Aedes p53
(Aep53) and IAP orthologs (IAP5, IAP9 and AeBruce). They proposed a mechanism in which
effector Aecasp7, activated by AeDronc, could promote either apoptosis or autophagy. The
latter is an important process in vector infection (Figure 18); however it is unknown how
caspase7 activates autophagy (Eng et al. 2016).

Recently, impaired autophagic flux accompanied by higher caspase activation and higher fly
mortality was shown in Drosophila lacking p53 (p53-/-) and treated with paraquat (ROS
inducer). Indeed, they observed that p53-/- flies were more sensitive to paraquat than control
w1118 flies. More interestingly, they also showed that the p53 isoforms called p53A (∆Np53)
and p53B (p53) were differentially regulated in the context of oxidative stress with an increase
in p53B transcripts but not p53A ones. Thus, as the sensitivity of p53-/- flies to paraquat was
similar to autophagy-defective mutant flies and as it has been demonstrated that p53 is a
regulator of autophagy, they hypothesized that p53-/- could present a defective autophagic
flux. Targeting ref(2)P/p62, which is normally degraded during autophagy and accumulated in
atg8-/- mutants, they observed a higher level of ref(2)P in p53 null flies. Since no Atg8
expression was identified in w1118 flies, they suggested that the sensitivity of p53-/- flies
treated with paraquat was associated with impaired autophagy. In addition, they proved that

                                                                                             81


oxidative stress induction in the p53-/- mutant led to an increase in apoptosis, reflected by
Drice and Dcp-1 caspase activity (Figure 18). Finally, they demonstrated that the p53A isoform
allowed the activation of caspases which in turn inhibited autophagy. On the contrary, by
overexpressing p53B they did not observe caspase activation but the activation of functional
autophagy instead. This study demonstrated the importance of p53 A and B isoforms in
response to oxidative stress and their opposite responses (Robin et al. 2019).

induction in Drosophila and arbovirus infection in Aedes.



Finally, to my knowledge the existence of phosphatidylserine (PS) orthologs and equivalent
mechanisms of “apoptotic mimicry” in mosquitoes and other insects has not been studied or
published. Nevertheless, in the Drosophila fly, PS ortholog receptors at the cell surface of
hemocytes (macrophages), called Draper and Integrin βv (Tung et al. 2013) have been
identified. The abdominal injection in Drosophila with Drosophila C virus (DCV) and the infection
of S2 cells revealed the induction of apoptosis and the presence of DCV in the hemocytes of
flies. By inhibiting PS recognition and blocking the receptors, they showed that infected flies
died earlier and suggested that PS-mediated phagocytosis plays an important antiviral role
against DCV infection (Nainu et al. 2015).

                                                                                              82


To conclude, during arbovirus infection in insects, several signaling pathways such as apoptosis,
oxidative stress, autophagy and other interconnected pathways seem to be involved in the
cellular outcome and subsequently in permissiveness and resistance to vectors.




4 Role of p53 and p53 isoforms during arbovirus infection in
  mammals and insects

             Human p53


                      Discovery of p53


Thanks to a virological approach p53 was first described as a protein that binds to the large A
antigen of the Simian virus SV40 (DeLeo et al. 1979; Lane and Crawford 1979; Linzer, Maltzman,
and Levine 1979). Then, p53 was studied extensively in the field of cancer research, firstly as an
oncogene in 1980 (Jenkins, Rudge, and Currie 1984; Land, Parada, and Weinberg 1983) and
finally as a tumor suppressor in 1990 (Baker et al. 1989; Chandar et al. 1992; Masuda et al.
1987). The clue to p53’s function as a tumor suppressor came from the finding that p53
deficient mice developed spontaneous tumors (Donehower et al. 1992). Another important
discovery revealed mutations in p53 alleles in a family presenting the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
These patients presented an increased risk of developing tissue sarcoma, and breast, bone and
brain tumors (Srivastava et al. 1990). At the time it was noticed that nearly half of all human
tumors were linked to mutations in the p53 gene.

p53 was given the title that clearly defines its function: “the guardian of the genome”. Indeed,
tumor suppressor p53 is responsible for ensuring the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in
response to several stimuli and defining cell fate. Since the discovery of p53 in 1979, more than
one hundred thousand articles on it have been published, making it the most studied protein.
One of the first activities of p53 investigated was its ability to bind DNA in a specific sequence,
mediating its transcriptional activation function; indeed, hundreds of genes are targeted by
p53. The activation of p53 can be engaged by several signals such as DNA damage, hypoxia,
oncogene signaling, pathogen detection and oxidative stress, and the cellular downstream

responses controlled by p53 are involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, immune
response, metabolism, DNA repair and senescence.



                     The p73/p63 and p53 family


Almost twenty years after the discovery of p53, two additional members, called p63 and p73,
have been identified, suggesting that p63 and p73 were ancestors of p53 and that p53 has
evolved by duplication and mutation (Blandino and Dobbelstein 2004). The disruption of the
p73 gene in mice has been associated with profound defects in homeostasis and neuronal
development but no susceptibility to spontaneous tumorigenesis was observed (Yang et al.
2000), whereas p63-/- mice presented major defects in their limb and epithelial development
(Yang et al. 1999), suggesting that both ancestor functions were principally involved in
development and morphogenesis. Regarding the structure of the mammal gene and protein
domain, p53 and p73/p63 share a similar N-terminal domain and only p73/p63 contain a sterile
alpha motif SAM in the C-terminal region. The SAM domain is necessary in protein-protein
interactions (Thanos and Bowie 1999).



                     Human p53 and p53 isoforms


The p53 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17 and presents 13 exons. To date,
it has been reported that the human p53 gene can express twelve p53 mRNAs in a tissue and
cell-dependent manner (Figure 19). The twelve different mRNAs result from alternative
promoter (P1 and P2) usage and alternative splicing (intron-2 and intron-9). The human p53
gene contains two promoters: one upstream of exon-1 and an internal promoter in intron-4,
resulting in four C-terminal mRNA variants (full-length p53, Δ40p53, Δ133p53 and Δ160p53).
The transcript from the P1 promoter can encode the full-length p53 (FLp53 or p53α) and
Δ40p53 (or Δ40p53α) due to the internal initiation of translation from codon 40 (ATG40) or the
alternative splicing of intron-2. These transcripts can also exist with two other different 5’
regions from the alternative splicing of exon-9 by retaining either exon-9β or exon-9ɣ and




                                                                                           84


encoding p53β or Δ40p53β proteins, and p53ɣ or Δ40p53ɣ proteins, respectively (Khoury and
Bourdon 2010).
The transcript from the P2 promoter, located within intron-4, encodes Δ133p53 (or Δ133p53α)
which is a N-terminally truncated protein, initiated at start codon 133, and Δ160p53 (or
Δ160p53α) translated due to ATG160 in the Δ133p53 transcript (Marcel et al. 2010). These
transcripts can also exist with two other different N-terminal regions by alternative splicing and
encode Δ133p53β, Δ133p53ɣ, Δ160p53β and Δ160p53ɣ (Figure 19, A).


                      Structure of p53 and p53 isoforms


The FLp53 (p53α or p53) is active as a tetramer, dimers of two homodimers, each containing
the 393 amino acid long protein composed of seven functional domains (Figure 19, B). The N-
terminus is composed of two transactivation domains (TAD1 -residues 1 to 40 and TAD2 -
residues 40 to 62) which are essential for the activation of the subset of p53-target genes (Venot
et al. 1999). FLp53 is composed of a proline-rich domain (PRD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD)
and a hinge domain (HD). The C-terminus is composed of an oligomerization domain (OD) which
allows p53 to form a tetramer organized as a dimer of dimers and a regulation domain (α) where
many post-translational modifications occurs (acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
SUMOylation, methylation, etc.) which are involved in the stability and activity of p53. The
export and import of p53 between the nucleus and cytoplasm occur due to one NES and three
NLS, distributed in oligomerization and regulation regions.

Figure 19: Human p53 gene organization (A) and the structure of the p53 protein and p53
protein isoforms (B).
A) The human p53 gene is composed of eleven exons (marked as colored boxes from 1 to 11)
and theoretically expresses twelve isoforms from alternative promoters - - P1 and P2, splicing
sites (α, β and ɣ) or translational initiation codon ATG. The promoter P1 located upstream from
exon-1 allows transcribing the full-length p53 from ATG1 and the Δ40p53 isoform from ATG40.
Internal promoter P2 is in exon-5 and produces Δ133p53 and Δ160p53 from ATG133 and
ATG160, respectively. The α, β and ɣ isoforms are produced by the different alternative splicings
of intron-9: α results from the entire splicing of intron-9, whereas β and ɣ are generated by the
retention of small parts. Legend: grey box regions =non-coding sequence.
B) The human p53 protein isoforms. The full-length p53 (from ATG1) contains two complete
transactivation domains (TAD1 and 2), rich proline domain (PRD), DNA-binding domain (DBD),
hinge domain containing NLS (HD), oligomerization (OD) and at the C-terminal regulatory region
(in red). The Δ40p53 isoform lacks the 40 first amino-acids included in the 1st TAD, the Δ133p53
and Δ160p53 isoforms lack both TAD and a part of DBD. The C-terminal isoforms from
alternative splicing are represented in red (α), in green fuchsia (β) and blue fuchsia (ɣ). The

                       Stabilization of p53


In undamaged cells, the low level of p53 is strictly controlled and engages the regulation of
transcript expression but mostly protein stabilization. Indeed, the amount of p53 protein is
determined more by its rate of post-translational degradation than by the translation of mRNA,
and this degradation is ensured by the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2 for mouse double
minute 2 (also called HDM2 for human double minute 2). Without stressful conditions, MDM2
binds to p53 in the nucleus and ubiquitinates it, promoting its exportation to the cytoplasm
where it is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the 20S and 26S proteasomes. Under diverse
stress conditions, modifications of p53 will induce its stabilization, accumulation, and
activation. It has been shown that the major mechanism controlling p53 stabilization is the
impact on MDM2-p53 interaction. The phosphorylation of p53 in the N-terminal and C-terminal
regions leads to a conformational change of the molecule which influences the interaction
between MDM2-p53. These phosphorylations are guided by protein kinases such as ATM
(ataxia-telangiectasia), JNK (Jun NH2-terminal kinase), p38, ATR (A-T and Rad3-related) and
others. One of the phosphorylations described most is on Serine 15 (Ser15) located in the
transactivation domain: for example, after DNA damage, the mediator ATM can phosphorylate
Ser15 on p53 as well as MDM2 (Banin et al. 1998). After Ultra-Violet or oxidative H2O2
treatment, JNK is responsible for the phosphorylation of p53 at Threonine 81, Thr81
(Buschmann et al. 2001). The phosphorylation of specific sites allows the induction of other
modifications in the process of p53 activation like the acetylation of serine, for example by
acetylase p300 belonging to histone acetylase family members CBP/p300. These mediators
enhance the DNA-binding activity of p53 and subsequently its transcriptional activity
(Avantaggiati et al. 1997). These few post-translational modifications give an overview of the
complex web governing the stabilization of p53 (Figure 21 “Regulation” and “Stabilization”
frames). In response to p53 activation, different pathways can be activated or inhibited due to
the transcription of p53-target genes. Pathogens have evolved various means to control cell
fate by p53 stabilization at the post-translational level in vertebrates, which will be discussed in
the following sections.

                       A transcription factor

-   Cell-cycle
The cell cycle is a fundamental cyclic sequence in the life of a cell and is divided into four phases
(Figure 20): 1) daughter cells produced after cell division of the mother cell undergo a sequence
of growth (G1) where proteins and membranes are synthesized; 2) the replication of DNA (S);
3) a second phase of growth (G2); and 4) the phase of mitosis where DNA is divided equally to
obtain two new daughter cells. A quiescent, nondividing phase can be adopted by cells (G0).
The cell cycle process is guided by an evolutionary conserved family of protein kinases called
cyclin-dependent kinases CDKs. The on/off switching of different CDKs and checkpoints allows
promoting or putting on standby the different stages of the cell cycle. The activities of CDKs
that allow the accumulation of corresponding cyclins are regulated by phosphorylation,
protein-protein interactions, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In addition to cyclin-CDK,
sensors regulate the passage from G1 to S or S to G2, etc. in the different steps of the cell cycle.
For instance, during the G1 phase, a transcription factor E2F is sequestered by a protein of the
retinoblastoma (pRb) participating in the efficient progress of the G1 phase and while this stage
is finishing, cyclin-CDK complexes (cyclinD-CDK4/6) induce the hyperphosphorylation of pRb.
The phosphorylation of pRB induces the release of E2F. E2F-dependent transcription
participates in the entry of the S phase through the restriction point, called R and induces the
transcription of cyclin A and B which activate CDK2 in a positive feed-back loop by
phosphorylation of pRB (Ezhevsky et al. 1997; Poon 2016).

                                                      cycle and CDK-cyclin complexes. The
                                                      cell cycle is divided into four phases:1) G1
                                                      where cell growth occurs; 2) the DNA
                                                      replication phase called S; 3) a second
                                                      growth stage, G2; and 4) the mitosis stage.
                                                      A nondividing cell can rest in G0 quiescent
                                                      phase. The cyclin/cyclin dependent kinase
                                                      (cyclin/CDK) strictly controls the efficient
                                                      process of a stage and the passage to the
                                                      new one (Adapted from Poon 2016).

Another checkpoint during G1 allows verifying if any DNA damage is detected and, if this is the
case, DNA repair is necessary. The mechanism assessing this checkpoint is a p53-dependent
mechanism: in the absence of DNA damage p53 is degraded through proteasome and DNA
damage detection by sensors inducing the activation of ATM and ATR, presented previously,
and p53 is activated. One of the transcriptional targets is p21, also called CDK interacting protein
1 or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein 1 (p21CIP1), which binds and inhibits the complex
cyclin A/E-CDK2, diminishing pRb phosphorylation and stopping the cell in the G1 phase (Deng
et al. 1995; Dulić et al. 1994) (Figure 21 “Cell cycle”). Another target gene, gadd45, is activated
after different stress and DNA damage. Gadd45 participates in the checkpoint in the G1 phase
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and can contribute to p53 stabilization via p38 (Salvador, Brown-
Clay, and Fornace 2013). Several DNA viruses, which integrate their genome inside the cell
genome, oncogenic viruses and even RNA viruses, take advantage of cell cycle control via p53
and other transcription factors, or p53 stabilization, for their own replication. They will be
presented in the following section.

-   Apoptosis
The apoptosis signaling pathway in mammals has been described previously and p53-mediated
apoptosis has been introduced listing p53-target genes such as bax, noxa, puma and apaf-1
(Figure 21). Moreover, the stabilization of p53 can be controlled by phosphorylation and
specific p53 response is mediated by the particular site of phosphorylation.

-   Autophagy

The regulation of autophagy can also be dependent on p53 and p53 plays a key role for the
activation or inhibition of autophagy (Figure 21). Indeed, under glucose starvation stress,
autophagy can be initiated indirectly by p53 through the inhibition of mTOR by the direct
transcription of Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or by blocking Akt
signaling that ultimately inhibits mTOR (Feng et al. 2007).
The inhibition of autophagy by p53 can be mediated by direct binding to the RB1-inducible
coiled-coiled protein 1 (RB1CC1) involved in the stabilization and phosphorylation of ULK1
(Morselli et al. 2011). Another function of p53 in autophagy is the accumulation of dsRNA in the
cell, from viral infection or DNA damage and abnormal transcription or stress, which can be
controlled by protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR).


                                                                                                 89


The PKR phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiator factor 2α (eIF2α) to shutdown
protein translation of the cell and it has been hypothesized that cytoplasmic p53 could degrade
dsRNA and indirectly activate PKR (Galluzzi, Kepp, and Kroemer 2010).




Figure 21: The complexity of the p53 regulation-activation stage and regulation of
targeted pathways. The control of p53 stabilization is influenced by the interaction of MDM2-
p53. Under nonstress cellular conditions, MDM2 binds p53 and monoubiquitinates beforeexport
to the cytoplasm for polyubiquitination and proteasome degradation. Under stress conditions,
like DNA damage or oxidative stress, sensors and mediators (ATM/ATR and JNK) will
phosphorylate p53, preventing its degradation and so induce its accumulation. A sufficiently high
level of p53 protein participates in the control of adequate cellular response: 1) the control of
cell cycle arrest through p21 pathway; 2) the transcription of pro-apoptotic proteins for apoptosis;
3) indirect action on mTOR and Beclin-1 for autophagy induction.



-   Type-I interferon signaling and p53 interaction during viral infection
Several reports in the field of cancerology have hesitated to link p53 and IFNs based on the
observation that p53 and interferon share antioncogenic activities. In 2000, Mecchia and
colleagues observed in melanoma cell lines an increase of the IFN-dependent accumulation of
p53 (Mecchia et al. 2000), and in 2003 Takaoka et al. demonstrated a link between p53 and
IFNα/β through the direct transcription of p53 mRNA by ISGF3 activated by IFN and its key role


                                                                                                 90


in antiviral response at an early stage of MEF infection with VSV (Takaoka et al. 2003). It was
shown that VSV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections induced the Ser15 phosphorylation
of p53 via ATM kinase and certain p53 target genes like mdm2 and puma were upregulated,
whereas p21 and noxa were not, indicating that p53 was efficiently activated and the response
engaged was different between viral infection and DNA damage. Interestingly, p53 mRNA
increases in infected WT MEFs but not in IFNAR-/- MEFs, whereas the Ser15 phosphorylation
of p53 was still detectable in IFNAR-/- MEFs, indicating that the transcription of p53 is
dependent on IFN but not its activation. MEFs p53-/- were infected more by VSV than WT MEFs
and VSV-induced apoptosis was reduced in p53-/-, suggesting a pro-apoptotic role of p53 in
MEFs. In parallel, in vivo mice p53-/- infected with VSV all died while 80% of the WT infected
survived. They suggested an increase of p53 mRNA dependent on IFN leading to an increase
of apoptosis dependent on p53. Previously, several investigators linked IFN Type-I and
apoptosis (Clemens 2003).



A few years later, Muñoz-Fontela et al. demonstrated another p53 function in the activation of
the IFN signaling pathway during the VSV infection of in vitro mouse MEF and human HCT116
and mice (Muñoz-Fontela et al. 2008). Firstly, to analyze the proapoptotic function of p53 to
impair viral infection they treated MEFs WT and p53-/- or not with broad-spectrum caspase
inhibitors and infected with VSV-GFP. As reported previously, p53-/- infected animals produced
a higher viral titer than WT. However, the WT treated with caspase inhibitors still reduced viral
replication while the cell-death level was like that obtained in p53-/-. Additional experiments
confirmed the higher VSV-GFP replication in the absence of p53 expression in EJp53 cell lines.
EJp53 presents a (TET)-regulatory p53 system accompanied with cell cycle arrest without the
induction of apoptosis: the inhibition of VSV-GFP replication seems to be independent of the
apoptotic-p53 function. They then showed the upregulation of ISGs Mx1, IRF7, RIG-I and IRF9
(containing ISGF3 complex, cf. Figure 10). Using a Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay,
they demonstrated a specific p53 binding region in the IRF9 promoter and determined that the
role of p53 in enhancing the IFN signaling pathway was clearly due to its transcriptional activity
and not its post-translational activity (Figure 22).




                                                                                               91


Figure 22: Type I interferon signaling pathway mediated by p53 activity. The Type-I
interferon production and signaling pathway can be influences by p53 activity during viral
infection through a positive feedback loop of the transcriptional induction of Interferon regulatory
factor 9 (IRF9).



Interestingly, IFN can upregulate IFIXα1 which downregulates post-translationally MDM2,
allowing the accumulation of p53 (Ding et al. 2006). Finally, it has been reported that after IRF7
expression through ISGF3, IRF7 can activate IFNα transcription, and that IFNα expression is
delayed by IFNβ expression (Marié et al. 1998).

Taken together, these results suggest that under viral infection, p53 regulates the IFNβ
signaling pathway by the direct transcription activation of IRF9 which associates with STAT and
translocates to the nucleus for the expression of ISGs including IRF7. IFN expression indirectly
allows the stabilization of p53 by the expression of Mdm2 antagonists and the positive
feedback loop of IFN production through IRF7 allows participation in p53 accumulation (Figure
22).



                                                                                                 92


To conclude, these discoveries indicate that p53 plays a key role in innate immune response by
rapid apoptosis and autophagy crosstalk or by reinforcing the type I IFN signaling pathway.
Moreover, this system guides p53 stabilization in infected cells and in neighboring uninfected
cells, suppressing viral dissemination more rapidly. The guardian of the genome is a suitable
name and we can clearly understand the evolutionary reasons that drove viruses to induce p53
agonists and antagonist factors.



             Drosophila and mosquito p53


                     Dmp53/Dp53 and p53 isoforms in Drosophila


The Dmp53 gene resembles the mammalian p53 gene in its structure and functionality,
however Drosophila presents a single p53 family gene that can potentially encode four p53
isoforms (Zhang et al. 2015). Dmp53/Dp53 or Dp53B is an orthologue of mammal FLp53, Dp53A,
also known as DΔNp53 and Dp53C, resembles human Δ133p53 and Δ40p53 like mRNA is
transcribed from an internal promoter and contains an N-terminal truncated TAD. Finally, the
Dp53E isoform bears a smaller TAD (Figure 23). The Dp53B protein includes one full
transactivation domain (TAD) where Dp53A and Dp53C contain a truncated TAD for almost the
60 first amino acids, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), nuclear localization signal (NLS),
oligomerization domain (OD) and C-terminal regulatory domain (CTR) (Marcel et al. 2011).
Studies on Drosophila p53 provided new insights on the role of p53 in cellular fate and on p53
and p53 isoform interactions and the consequences on p53-mediated cellular responses. In the
absence of p63 and p73, it has been understood that Dp53 and p53 isoforms ensure the control
of cell death, autophagy, cell differentiation, embryogenesis and lifespan in a sex-dependent
manner (Ingaramo, Sánchez, and Dekanty 2018).

Historically, Dp53A was the first p53 isoform discovered but it was mistaken for Dp53, indicating
why this isoform is that most studied (Ollmann et al. 2000). Studies on irradiated imaginal discs
referring to the post-embryonic development of fly, mutated for Dp53, have shown reduced
apoptosis and normal cell cycle arrest, suggesting a specific apoptotic engagement of Dp53.
Then, the Dp53A isoform was characterized as the main isoform mediating apoptosis through
reaper transcription following DNA damage (Brodsky et al. 2000).




                      Recent discovery of two p53 isoforms in Aedes

The sequencing and uncomplete annotation of the mosquitoes Aedes albopictus, Aedes aegypti
and Anopheles gambiae have led to the identification of two p53 sequences in the mosquito
(Figure 24). Indeed, Chen et al. created a phylogenetic tree based on p53 amino acid sequences
derived from 22 mosquito species, several other insects (order Diptera) and a control outgroup
from a snail sequence. Then, by predicting amino acid sequences from p53 homologues derived
from mosquito species and species of flies they identified two paralogues of p53, named “p53-
1” and “p53-2” in the four mosquitoes species studied (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Culex


                                                                                              94


 quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae) with a single homologue in fly species (Drosophila
 melanogaster, ceratitis capitatal and Bactrocera dorsalis). They confirmed this result using two
 different phylogenetic methods (neighbor joining and stronger method, namely the maximum-
 likelihood method) (Chen et al. 2017). They suggested a duplication origin of p53 isoforms of
 mosquitoes and further studies are needed to better characterize p53-1 and p53-2. Based on
 DBD amino acid predicted sequences it was estimated that the p53-1 of Aedes aegypti shared
 67% similarity with Ae. albopictus and 50% with Cx. quinquefasciatus and for p53-2, 82% and
 63%, respectively (Figure 24). Anopheles gambiae showed less than 28% similarity for both
 paralogues with three other mosquito species.

             Control of p53 pathways during viral infection


                      Function of p53 during “non-arboviral” infections

-   SV40 and p53

The discovery of the large T-Antigen protein of SV40 (Polyomavirus, small DNA genome 5.2 kb)
has started the investigation of interactions between oncogenic virus proteins and p53. In
humans, the question of whether Simian Virus 40 (SV40) can cause human tumors is highly
controversial (Poulin and DeCaprio 2006). The infection of host cells with SV40 leads to cell
transformation by the control of the cell cycle by the passage from G1 to the S phase (O’Reilly
1986). It has been shown that the T-antigen can bind to pRb, releasing E2F and activating its
transcriptional activity that mediates the passage to the S phase (Figure 25). In parallel, the T-
antigen can also block p53 then sense the aberrant passage to the S phase and thus inhibit
apoptosis (Ludlow 1993). In mouse fibroblast 3T3 cells it has been shown that the T-antigen can
also bind to TAD1 of p53 and control acetylation by the recruitment of p300/CBP, encouraging
p53 DNA-binding activity and maybe target genes for cell transformation (Hermannstädter et
al. 2009). However, p53 still controls SV40 at an early stage of infection before T-antigen
detection. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that p53 was activated in non-T-antigen positive
cells and could bind to the T-antigen promoter, stopping its transcription by preventing factor
Sp1 (specificity protein 1) binding (Drayman et al. 2016).




-   p53 and HPVs

Another DNA virus, Human papilloma virus (HPV), leads to persistent infection associated with
cervical cancer. HPVs viruses are small double-strand DNA viruses which present a tropism for
squamous epithelial cells. HPVs are classified into five genera, named alpha α, beta β, gamma
γ, mu μ and nu ν which are also subdivided into species referenced by numbers. The majority
of HPV infections are benign and resolved without progression to cancer. The different HPV
types are usually referred as “low risk” (wart-causing) or “high risk” (cancer-causing) and the
diversity of pathology is reflected by phylogenetic relationships between HPV types. The high
risk HPVs can cause several types of cancer such as cancer of the oropharynx, vagina, penis and
anus, and it has been revealed that oncoproteins E6 and E7 are essential for the oncogenic cell

                                                                                               96


transformation phenotype (Ghittoni et al. 2010; Moody and Laimins 2010). Indeed, the E6
oncoprotein mediates the degradation of p53 involving the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome
(Scheffner et al. 1990; Scheffner et al. 1993). In parallel, it has been demonstrated that the E7
oncoprotein can bind to pRb, promoting its degradation and subsequently perturbating cell
proliferation (Dyson et al. 1989). Moreover, studies of the efficiency of E7 in targeting pRb
showed that the oncogenic potential of some HPVs was dependent on this efficiency of E7 to
bind to pRb (Caldeira, Dong and Tommasino 2005). More recently, it has been proposed that
E7 can also indirectly interfere with p53 function independently of E6 through the deregulation
of cell cycle genes under the control of the p53-p21-DREAM pathway (Fischer et al. 2017). The
DREAM (Dimerization partner DR, RB-like, E2F and multi-vulval class B MuvB) complex is
essential for the good progress of the cell cycle. Indeed, the DREAM complex mediates the
repression of cell cycle genes during the G0 phase (quiescence) and organizes periodic gene
expression with peaks during the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Figure 25). This strict
coordination is provided by additional factors: the RB-like pocket proteins p130 and p107 in the
DREAM complex, which repress cell cycle gene expression during the G0 phase, whereas MYB-
like 2 MYBL2 and forkhead box M1 FOXM1 coordinate gene expression during replication and
G2/M phases (Sadasivam and DeCaprio 2013). The HPV E7 oncoproteins can disrupt the p130-
DREAM complex, promoting the S phase, either by interaction and disruption of p130, or by
interaction with p21, the inhibitor of Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 activation (Nor Rashid et al.
2016).


-   p53 and HIV
The lentivirus HIV-1 responsible for the development of AIDS (Acquired ImmunoDeficiency
Syndrome) also evolved to block p53 pathways in immune cells through viral factors. Greenway
and colleagues reported that the viral protein Nef can interact with p53 and decrease its
transcription activity in MOLT-4 cells that subsequently inhibit apoptosis and could allow longer
cell viability beneficial for viral replication (Greenway et al. 2002) (Figure 25). In parallel,
another viral factor, Vif, can control the stabilization of p53 acting on p53/MDM2 interaction in
order to mediate G2 cell cycle arrest, suggesting a contributable effect on virus production (Goh
et al. 1998; Izumi et al. 2010). The dual effect on p53 seems to be perfect control of cell fate
during viral infection.



                                                                                              97


The control of p53 and p53 pathways seems to be an important mechanism shared by several
different viruses, making research necessary to elucidate the issue of therapeutic strategies
targeting p53 in a tissue dependent manner.

In the old-world alphavirus infections, only one study has shown that SFV induced apoptosis in
BHK cells and also in lung carcinoma cells deleted for the p53 gene, suggesting a p53-
independent apoptosis (Glasgow et al. 1998). To my knowledge, no studies on the involvement
of p53 during CHIKV in mammals and insects have been published.

In parallel, more investigations into the role of p53 during flavivirus infections have revealed
p53-dependent cell death. The infection of the human liver Huh-7 cell line with DENV led to
apoptosis detected by TUNEL and PS externalization and a decrease of mitochondrial
transmembrane potential. In a p53-deficient cell line (H1299), virus-induced cell death was
non-detectable (Nasirudeen, Wang, and Liu 2008). Curiously, previous studies have shown the
induction of apoptosis in liver cell lines HepG2 (WT p53) and in Hep3B (p53-/-) and at 7 dpi. All
the infected p53-/- cells died, whereas p53 WT was persistently infected for 3 months with
DENV. Moreover, viral particles produced from Hep3B were significantly more efficient in new
cell attachment compared to HepG2 (Thongtan, Panyim, and Smith 2004). They proposed that
DENV-induced apoptosis was p53-independent, however, p53 could play a role in lowering viral
particle production, thereby avoiding apoptosis.

Interestingly, a recent study, using the HepG2 cell line, has shown that RNAi knockdown of p53
was linked to increasing virus production and decreasing Type-I interferon (IFNβ) secretion in
supernatant at 24 hours post infection. The percentage of apoptotic cells was the same in both
infected cells (Hu et al. 2017). Taken together, these results seem to indicate that in both
studies, Dengue virus infection was controlled by p53, through the IFN pathway and not the
apoptotic pathway.

In the mosquito, it has been shown that infection of the Ae.albopictus C636 cell line with DENV
induced the upregulation of isoform p53-2 and not p53-1 at 24, 36 and 48hpi (Chen et al. 2017).
In order to investigate the function of the p53-2 isoform during DENV infection, they


                                                                                              98


hypothesized different functions of p53-1 and p53-2 in oxidative stress response and cell death,
as has been previously shown for oxidative stress response in DENV-infected C636 associated
with antioxidant defense and antiapoptotic effects (Chen et al. 2012). The knockdown (KD) of
p53-2 but not p53-1 increased cell death and oxidative stress in a DENV-infected C636 cell line
over time. Moreover, among six antioxidant genes, only one has been shown to significantly
decrease in KD p53-2 infected cells, i.e. the catalase CAT. The activation of CAT confirmed the
transcriptional activity of p53 during DENV infection (Chen et al. 2018).

The outbreak of Zika virus in 2014 in Brazil is associated with microcephaly in newborn
infants. Indeed, infections during pregnancy were linked to spontaneous abortion,
stillbirth, fetal malformations, or microcephaly. ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda in 1947
and it has been detected in Africa and Southeast Asia, causing self-limiting febrile disease
in humans. It has been demonstrated that there are two distinct lineages: African and
Asian. Following the outbreak in Brazil there have been extensive efforts to develop a new
animal model as ZIKV does not cause infection and disease in wild type adult mice. Even if


                                                                                             99


the mice present significant differences in their placenta anatomy and gestation period
compared to human, they are very useful for reproducing ZIKV pathogenesis regarding its
neurotropic nature of infection. It has been shown that ZIKV infection in animal models
(mice, macaques) is associated with the activation of immune responses, inflammation,
and neural damage in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Moreover, the comparison of
African and Asian lineages in Stat2-/- mice has revealed a higher expression level of type I
and type II IFNs and cytokines in African lineages compared to Asian ones (Tripathi et al.
2017).

Several other investigations have rapidly identified a considerable induction of apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest response in humans proliferating neural progenitors. In 2016, Ghouzzi
et al. showed the accumulation of p53 perhaps by Ser15 phosphorylation, associated with
the induction of cleaved caspase-3 apoptosis in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs)
(Ghouzzi et al. 2016). Later, two additional studies reported a central role of ZIKV capsid in
apoptosis induction by p53 stabilization acting on the p53/MDM2 axis, and suggesting a
role of capsid-mediated pathogenic process in neurodevelopment disruption and
subsequently microcephaly (Slomnicki et al. 2017; Teng et al. 2017). Finally, Frumence and
colleagues showed that human lung epithelial A549 cells were susceptible to the South
Pacific epidemic strain of Zika virus and demonstrated that their infection led to IFNβ
production, IRF3 and IRF7 expression and then the expression of ISGs genes such as
IFIT1/ISG56 and IFIT2/ISG54. Moreover, they demonstrated that A549 infected cells
undergo apoptosis through caspase-9, caspase-3 activation, and the cleavage of PARP at
48 hours post infection. The induction of apoptosis occurred at the maximum of virus
production and was also associated with the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS.
Interestingly, they challenged A549 cells with IFNβ prior to and post Zika virus infection
and revealed a drastic diminution in the production of ZIKV particles at 48 hpi and an
increase in cell viability at 48 and 72 hpi. Moreover, the activity of caspase -3/7 decreased
drastically, by the same magnitude as cells incubated with pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk
(Frumence et al. 2016). They showed that the infection of A549 induced the release of
IFNβ, which presents an antiviral effect. However, IFNβ also presented a protective role by
preventing apoptosis induction. Thus, they hypothesized that the early release of IFNβ
could lead to the sufficient survival of ZIKV-infected epithelial cells that promote viral

replication by delaying apoptosis. The accumulation of p53 was investigated but it would
be most interesting to study the effect of A549 p53 +/+ and A549 p53-/- on ZIKV infection.

The pathogenicity of West Nile virus has been also related to p53 apoptosis in infected
U2OS and SH-SY5Y cell lines where the viral capsid can sequester HDM2/MDM2 to interfere
with p53/HDM2 interaction (Figure 25). The complex of non-structural viral protein NS2B-
NS3 induces caspase 8 activation and the viral capsid, caspase 9 and 3 activation (Yang et
al. 2008). The induction of apoptosis seems to promote viral infection and could explain
the pathogenic process.

To conclude, the activity of p53 during several different viral infections seems to be linked
either to pro- or anti-viral effects, but in any case, it seems to play a central role.



                      Modulation of p53 transcriptional activity by p53 isoforms during viral
                      infection


Human p53 isoforms can regulate p53 transcriptional activity and subsequently regulate the
p53 signaling pathway, and even this axis has been shown to be regulated or exploited during
viral infection.

Once again, the regulation of p53 transcription activity by p53 isoforms has been investigated
in the field of cancer, because it has been observed that p53 isoforms appear to be
dysregulated in different types of cancer (Bourdon et al. 2005). It has been hypothesized that
p53 isoforms could exert an effect either on their own, thanks to their intrinsic properties
and/or by modulating full length p53 activity. Firstly, it has been shown that in transfected cells,
Δ40p53 can associate p53 as heterodimers and promote the translocation of p53 from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus via the reduction of MDM2-mediated polyubiquitination and inhibit
p53-mediated growth suppression (Ghosh, Stewart, and Matlashewski 2004). Interestingly, in
cell lines H1299 (p53-/-) expressing Δ40p53 or not and cultured in starvation condition, it has
been reported that Δ40p53 alone can decrease the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, which is a
parameter of autophagosome formation (Zang et al. 2017). Previously, it was indicated that
p53 can inhibit autophagy through the phosphorylation of PKR/eIF2α by dsRNA degradation
and in this study it was demonstrated that Δ40p53 and p53 present an exonuclease activity

                                                                                                101


participating in dsRNA degradation and the inhibition of starvation-induced autophagy by
blocking PKR phosphorylation. They also showed that after DNA damage induction, Δ40p53
promoted p53 nuclear translocation and inhibited p53 activity-induced cell death; however,
the dominant negative effect of nuclear Δ40p53 on p53 is contradictory and further studies are
needed. Nonetheless, taken together, these results suggested that during viral infection
producing dsRNA, Δ40p53 and p53 could promote an antiviral response by inhibiting autophagy
and cell death activation. Moreover, it has been reported that ISG15 could be directly targeted
by p53 in response to dsRNA but not in a p53-dependent manner during an RNA virus NDV
(Newcastle Disease virus, family Paramyxoviridae) infection (Hummer, Li, and Hassel 2001).

Studies on two other isoforms, p53β and Δ133p53, have shown that in human fibroblasts p53β
could increase p53 transcriptional activity in a promoter-dependent manner to promote
cellular senescence, whereas Δ133p53 diminished this p53-mediated replicative senescence
(Fujita et al. 2009). Indeed, in a Luciferase reporter system, it was demonstrated that p53β
could associate p53 and upregulated bax but not p21, suggesting that this isoform favors the
expression of apoptotic genes. As the Δ133p53 isoform lacks TADs, it cannot induce
transcription and play a dominant-negative role by association with p53. For instance,
overexpression of Δ133p53 with p53 was associated with the inhibition of apoptosis.
Moreover, the association of heterodimers Δ133p53/p53 promoted cell survival at a low level
of oxidative stress (Gong, Pan, Yuan, et al. 2016) in HCT116 cell lines and DNA double-strand
break (DSB) repair in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (Gong, Pan, Chen, et al. 2016).
Finally, Δ133p53 seems to be involved in the development of inflammation and autoimmune
disease (Campbell et al. 2012).

Concerning viral infection, the first evidence of p53 isoform (Δ133p53 and p53β) regulation
was highlighted during Influenza A virus infection of human epithelial A549 cells (Terrier et al.
2012). Firstly, they observed that total knockdown of p53 in A549 cells was associated with an
increase of viral replication and production, and then siRNA silencing of Δ133p53 induced a
decrease of viral production. In parallel, the siRNA silencing of the p53β transcript led to an
increase in viral production. In the absence of p53, no viral decrease has been observed in the
presence of isoforms, whereas the co-expression of p53 and Δ133p53 led to a considerable
increase of viral production and it was inhibited in the presence of p53β. Taken together, these
results suggest an inter-connected response of p53 and p53 isoforms during viral infection

                                                                                             102


where Δ133p53 presented a pro- and p53β an anti-viral effect. The different responses
involved in p53 and p53 isoforms like apoptosis, cell cycle and immune response could be
controlled by viruses.

Recently, Wang and colleagues have shown that KO of p53 in A549 using CRISPR/Cas9
technology was associated with a lesser percentage of infected cells and viral RNA copies
compared to WTp53. They demonstrated that attenuated viral dissemination was linked to
neither an initial entry process nor a decrease of caspase-3 activity in infected p53 KO cells, but
to a direct inhibiting effect of p53 on Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs)
controlled by IAV (Wang et al. 2018). The mechanisms by which IFITMs inhibit virus infection is
not clearly understood, however it has been demonstrated that IFITMs may block virus entry
and virus-endosome fusion. In the context of IAV infection, it has been shown that IFITMs
restrict IAV exit by blocking fusion pore formation from late endosomes (Brass et al. 2009).
Moreover, Wang and colleagues have reported that Δ40p53 isoform expression in infected
A549 cells is associated with a higher percentage of infected cells and fewer transcript levels of
IFITMs, revealing a new role of Δ40p53 during IAV infection. To explain the effect of p53 during
IAV infection, they suggested that p21 may impact IAV infection via protein kinase PAK1
previously reported to enhance the viral titer of IAV (Pascua et al. 2011). Interestingly, the
decrease in IAV infection contradicted the results obtained previously by Terrier’s study where
the decrease of p53 was associated with an increase in IAV production (Terrier et al. 2012).
These two studies used A549 cell lines but not the same system to knockout p53.

To conclude, studies on p53 and p53 isoforms in the context of viral infection have revealed
new mechanisms by which the cells and virus exploit the effect of the protein on cell fate.
Therefore, it seems obvious that the relative expression of p53 isoforms in a cell, tissue and
time-dependent manner is one of the most important factors involved in p53 signaling
pathways and highlights the attention that should be given during p53 research.

OBJECTIVES

  The chikungunya virus is a re-emerging virus representing a public health issue worldwide.
The recent outbreaks have caused disabling diseases in humans with joint and muscle pains.
Currently, there are no vaccines or adapted treatments for the disease. Thus, the investigation
of alphavirus biology in the mammal host and insect vector is crucial. Indeed, the chikungunya
virus is an arbovirus transmitted to vertebrate hosts by the Aedes mosquito vector. At the
cellular level, the chikungunya virus exhibits lytic infection in mammalian cells, whereas it
causes persistent infection in mosquito cells. The involvement of apoptotic cell death as an anti-
viral activity has been investigated in mammalian and mosquito cells. However, the cellular
mechanisms mediating the induction of apoptosis and its function following viral infection
remain enigmatic. As presented in the introduction, the central role of p53 for the control of
apoptosis, cell cycle and immune response is increasingly studied in the context of virus
infection. The main objective of my project was to study the potential function of p53 during
chikungunya infection in mammals and insects.

  The first objective was focused on the implication of full length p53 during chikungunya virus
infection in a human muscle cell line and in insects using the in vivo model Drosophila
melanogaster and Aedes mosquito cell lines. In the human muscle cell line and in Drosophila
melanogaster, we have investigated the effect of p53 depletion on viral replication and cellular
response, focusing on cell death and interferon Type-I signalling pathways. For the mosquito
cells we have examined the impact of two CHIKV particles, one produced in mammals and other
one in mosquito cells, on p53-target genes.

  In the second area of investigation, we have developed molecular and cellular tools to study
the potential function of p53 isoforms ∆40p53α and ∆133p53α during chikungunya virus
infection in a human muscle cell line. To do this, we have generated CRISPR/Cas9 cell lines
overexpressing endogenous ∆40p53 in p53 wildtype and p53-/- cell lines. In parallel, we have
generated inducible cell lines overexpressing ∆40p53α and ∆133p53α.

CHAPTER 1) Opposite effect of p53 on CHIKV infection in a human

1 Objectives

In this first part, the objective was to investigate the potential role of p53 protein during
chikungunya virus infection in a human muscle cell line and in insects using the in vivo model
Drosophila melanogaster and in vitro mosquito cell lines. In order to study the potential
function of p53 we first analyzed the p53-target genes involved in cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis. In parallel, interested by the recent discovery concerning the influence of p53 on
antiviral innate immunity we investigated the Type-I interferon production and signaling
pathway. Using another approach, CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we investigated the function of
p53 in a human primary immortalized muscle cell line and in Drosophila melanogaster.

insect cells incubator.


Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) LR2006 strain from La Réunion and Sindbis virus (SINV) Toto 1101
strain infectious molecular clones were used to generate replicative viruses: from the plasmid
clone, viral RNA (vRNA) was generated by in vitro transcription using mMessage, mMachine kit,
Ambion. Then, 5.106 BHK-21 cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS 1 X, resuspend in Opti-MEM

and then mixed with 0.5M sucrose (MP Biomedicals) and 50mM HEPES (GibcoTM Thermo
Scientific) for conservation at -80°C. Viral stocks were titrated by TCID50 and plaque assay on
VeroE6.


             Generation of TP53 CRISPR-mediated knockout LHCN-M2 cell line
To analyze the potential role of p53 during CHIKV infection in LHCN-M2 cells, Knock-Out (KO)
cells were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The several steps from design of a single-
guide RNA (sgRNA) specific for the gene of interest to the validation of KO cells are presented
as following:



                       sgRNA design
The design of single guide RNA (sgRNA) was performed on CHOPCHOP website. The sgRNA must
be next to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence of gene of interest for Cas9 cleavage
and length of 19-21 nucleotides with 50% of GC. Some parameters were chosen to select sgRNA
with the highest efficiency score, the highest out-of-frame score, and the smallest risk of off-
targets (Table 3). In order to increase the efficiency of KO we have decided to design two
different sgRNA, if possible, at the beginning and n the middle of the gene of interest in order
to generate two double-strand breaks.
Then, sgRNA were cloned in Addgene lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid (Figure 26). Note that as the
lentiCRISPRv2 contains a U6 promoter, a Guanine (in green) was added when primer started
with another nucleotide during design of primer to increase transcription efficiency. To finish,

the BsmBI digestion generate an overhang on the plasmid. The sequences in red were added
on forward and reverse primers for cloning plus a Guanine G / Cytosine C when the latter was
not present on the primer.

                       Cloning in lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid

Firstly, the lentiCRISPRv2 vector was digested with BsmBI restriction enzyme (NEB) in NEB
BufferTM 3.1 for 1h at 55°C then 20minutes at 80°C for inactivate enzyme. Then, digested
product was purified from agarose gel using Macherey-Nagel™ NucleoSpin™ Gel and PCR Clean-
up Kit.
In parallel, each pair of primers (2μg) were annealed using an annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8, 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) for 3minutes at 90°C following by incubation of 15minutes
at 37°C.
Ligation of annealed primers and digested lentiCRISPRv2 was performed using a ligation kit
(Rapid DNA ligation kit, Roche) for 30minutes at Room Temperature (RT) and then transformed
into DH5α E. coli competent bacteria. On growth colonies, PCRs were realized to detect the
insert DNA in lentiCRISPRv2 using the forward of primer of interest and reverse in the backbone.
The positive clones were amplified and purified before being digested for verification.


                      Lentivirus production

The generation of lentivirus allow to generate stable cell lines expressing the sgRNA of interest
and the Cas9 nuclease. Day first, 2,5.106 HEK 293T cells were seeded in cell culture dish in 8 mL
DMEM + 10% FBS. The next day, cells were co-transfected using calcium phosphate co-
precipitation method by adding 8.3 μg of HIV packaging construct with a CMV promoter
(psPAX2, AddGene 12260), 8μg of the lentiCRISPRv2_sgRNA of interest and 2.5μg of VSV
glycoprotein-expressing construct with CMV promoter (pVSVg, AddGene 8454). Media were
changed 16 hours after transfection, and 24 hours later supernatant were harvested, filtered
through 0.45 μm pore-sized membranes and stored at -80°C before transduction of target cells.




                      Stable cell line generation

Target cells were seeded in P6-well plate at 2.105 density in 2mL of medium and transduced day
after with lentivirus previously produced. Day after transduction, cells were treated with
puromycin to select only cells where the lentiCRISPRv2_sgRNA had been incorporated into
DNA. This puromycin selection was maintained until all non-transduced control cells were

analyzed.

To confirm TP53 gene knockout we used SDS-PAGE using different p53 antibodies described
below (6. Western Blot).


              Infection of knockout cell lines with CHIKV

LHCN-M2 Wild Type (WT), sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 were seeded whether in 48-well plate at
30 000 cells/well, or in 6-well plate at 250 000 cells/well or in 12-well plate at 140 000 cells/well
and the day after recounted to adapt the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Cells were incubated
with CHIKV MOI 0.1 for 1h30 at 37°C and then washed once with PBS 1X and culture in LHCN-
M2 medium for 6, 8, 12,16, 24, and 36 hours. At these different times, cells were collected for
different analysis. Cells were seeded in a BioSafety level 2 (BSL2) laboratory and for CHIKV and
SINV infections, cells were manipulated in BioSafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory.


              Transfection of plasmid Flag-RIG-I 2CARD

LHCN-M2 immortalized cell lines WT, sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 were cultured in complex
LHCN-M2 medium and transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were seeded in 6-well plate at
250 000 cells/well and the day after transfected with 10 or 100 ng of plasmid Flag-RIG-I CARD
for 24 hours, kindly provided by Dr. Ratinier (Versteeg et al. 2013). The plasmid expresses the
two CARD domains of retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) which activate MAVS and allow the
induction of IFN production and signaling pathway.

secondary antibody (1/200) (F0257, Sigam Aldrich) in solution A for 45 minutes at 4°C. After
that, cells were washed twice with PBS 1X and immunostained cells were analyzed using flow
cytometer FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences.


             Western blot

After CHIKV infection in 6-well plate and at different times post-infection, cells were lysed in
200μl of cell Lysis Buffer 1X (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4,
1 μg/ml leupeptin, Cell Signaling Technology®) supplemented with Phosphatase and Inhibitors
Protease 1X (Sigma) and Dithiothreitol (DTT) at 1mM. Cell lysates were sonicated on ice and
after 30 minutes of incubation on ice, centrifuged 10 minutes, 11 000g, 4°C. The supernatants
were transfered in new tubes and a Bradford protein quantification was performed. 50μg of
cell extracts were loaded on SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane as
indicated on manufacturer’s protocol (Biorad). Membranes were blocked in 10% milk, PBS 1X,
0.1% Tween20 for 2 hours at Room temperature (RT) and incubated with appropriated primary
antibodies overnight in agitation at 4°C. Day after, membranes were washed three times for 5
minutes with PBS 1X, 0.1% Tween20 at RT and secondary antibodies were incubated 2h in
agitation at RT. After three new washes, proteins were revealed with SuperSignal TM
chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific) using ChemiDoc® imaging system (Biorad).

             Cell viability assays

In order to monitor the effect of viral infection on LHCN-M2 Wild Type (WT), LHCN-M2
sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 viability, the ATP was quantified in cells and supernatants using
CellTiter-Glo® luminescence cell viability assay kit (Promega). Cells were plated on 96-well plate
day one at 10 000 cells/well in 100μl of LHCN-M2 medium. At 8, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours, 100μl
of cell titer was added on cells and ATP quantification was measured by luminescence using a
plate reader (Victor2 plate reader, Perkin Elmer).


             Subcellular fractionation

To analyze the repartition of specifics proteins between the cytoplasmic and nucleic fractions
in CHIKV-infected cells, subcellular fractionation was carried out. Cells were seeded in T-150
flask at 5.106 cells/T-150. Day after, cells were infected with CHIKV at MOI 0.1 for 1 hour 30 at
37°C until medium change. At 8, 16 and 24 hours post-infection, cells were wash with PBS 1X,
trypsinized and centrifuged 600g, 5minutes at 4°C. Pellets were washed once with PBS 1X and
centrifuged again 600g, 5 minutes at 4°C before separation of nucleus and cytoplasm using
firstly solution A (10mM Hepes, 10mM NaCl, 1mM KH2PO4, 5mM NaHCO3, 1mM CaCl2 and
0.5mM MgCl2) supplemented with 1mM Dithiothreitol (Sigma), 5mM EDTA (Sigma) and 1X
Phosphatase and Inhibitors Protease (Sigma). The resuspended pellet in 500μl of solution A
was placed into a tissue/cells grinder 1mL, Loose pestle (Wheaton) and 30 repetitions of moving
the pestle up and down were applied. Then, the mixture was centrifuged 600g, 5 minutes at
4°C and supernatant (~420 μl - cytoplasmic fraction) was placed in a new 1.5mL tube

supplemented with 6X Laemmli and heated 10 minutes at 95°C for virus inactivation and
Western blot analysis.
The pellet (nucleic fraction) was then resuspended in 500μl of solution B (10 mM TrisHCL pH
7.5, 300mM sucrose and 1mM EDTA pH 8) supplemented with 0.1 % of NP-40 (Sigma) and 1X
Phosphatase and Inhibitors Protease (Sigma). Once again, resuspended pellet was place into
tissue/cells grinder 1mL, Loose pestle (Wheaton) and 30 repetitions of moving the pestle up
and down were applied. The exploded nucleus was centrifuged 600g, 5 minutes at 4°C and
washed with complete solution B twice before being resuspended in 60μl of same solution
supplemented with 6X Laemmli and heat 10 minutes 95°C. Cytoplasmic and nucleic fractions
were stored at -20°C before analysis by SDS-PAGE using same protocol described in section 6.
Western blot. The Tubulin and Lamin A were used to control the separation of cytoplasm and
nucleus, respectively.


             In vivo Drosophila melanogaster

Flies were reared on standard medium at 25°C. The following strains were used: w1118(wild-
type), p535A1−4null allele (Bloominutesgton Stock center, BL6815). These two strains were given
by Professor B. Mollereau (ENS, Lyon, LBMC – Apoptosis and neurogenetics), (Rong et al. 2002).
In this study we used only 3 to 6 days old adult male flies.


                         Detection of Wolbachia by PCR and tetracycline treatment


Flies were diagnosed for Wolbachia strains by PCR and positive Wolbachia flies were treated
with Tetracycline into fly medium at final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL for at least two
generations and tested again. Three independent flies per line were tested: flies were freeze 15
minutes at -20°C and then squashed in 50μl of squashing Buffer (10mM TrisHCL pH 8.2, 1mM
EDTA, 25mM NaCl and 200μg/mL proteinase K) for 30 minutes at 37°C before proteinase K
inactivation by heating 10 minutes at 95°C. PCR detection of Wolbachia strains was carried out
using following primers: wsp81Fw 5’- TGGTCCAATAAGTGATGAAGAAAC-3’ and wsp691Rv 5’-
AAAAATTAAACGCTACTCCA-3’ (W. Zhou, Rousset, and O’Neil 1998).

                      Fly injection


Three to six-day old male flies were injected intrathoracically with 46 nL of appropriate MOI of
virus (200 PFU per D. melanogaster) using a nanoinjector (Nanoject II, Drummond Scientific)
(Roy et al. 2020). CHIKV LR2006 strain and SINV Toto 1101 strain were collected in supernatants
24 hours post-infection of VeroE6 cells, filtered at 0.2μm and store at -80°C without sucrose
and Hepes before TCID50 and plaque assays titrations.
After injections, at the indicated time points, different numbers of flies were pooled and
harvested either for total RNA extraction using NuceoZOL reagent (Macherey Nagel) or for
TCID50 using crushing medium (DMEM, 4% FBS, amphotericin 2.5 μg/mM, Nystatin 100U/mL,
Gentamicin 50 μg/mL and penicillin/Streptomycin 50 g/mL).


                      Survival curve


For survival curve, two independents experiments were carried out. First day, 15 flies of each
strain (w1118 and p53-/-) were injected either with CHIKV virus or with Mock medium and
incubated until we observed the death of all of one of the two strains (CHIKV vs. Mock). Each
day, alive and dead flies were counted, and experiments were analyzed using “Survival” table
of GraphPad Prism 6 software®.


                      RNA extraction of whole fly


For total RNA extraction, two injected male flies were pooled in 500 μl of NuceoZOL reagent
and crushed using a manual polypropylene pestle (Sigma-Aldrich).           Crushed flies were
centrifuged, 12 000g, 5 minutes at 4°C and supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C
before RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol NucleoSpin® RNA Set for
NucleoZOL (Macherey Nagel).
Then, RNA was reverse transcribed in complementary DNA (cDNA) using PrimeScript TM RT-PCR
kit (Takara). Specifics cDNA were quantified by qPCR using SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (Takara) using
AriaMx system (Agilent).

In mammals: innate immune antiviral activity of p53 in human skeletal muscle
    cells infected with CHIKV

              Infection of an LHCN-M2 cell line by CHIKV induces stabilization of p53 protein


 As it has been reported that CHIKV infects satellite muscle cells, we decided to use the
 immortalized human skeletal muscle cell line LHCN-M2 (Zhu et al. 2007) which represents a
 relevant cellular model for CHIKV studies. First, we investigated the permissiveness of cells by
 detecting the percentage of infected cells over time by flow cytometry, targeting the viral
 capsid, and the efficiency of viral replication via quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-
 qPCR), targeting a fragment of nsP2 (Figure 27 A. and B.). We observed that CHIKV (MOI=0.1)
 could infect and replicate efficiently in LHCN-M2 overtime with an exponential phase from 12
 to 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and a decrease of CHIKV-positive cells from 24 to 48 hpi
 associated with cytopathic effects (CPE) and the complete destruction of an infected cell layer
 after 48 hours. Then, the stabilization of p53 protein was investigated in CHIKV-LHCN-M2
 infected cells at 24 hpi (Figure 27 C.) and we observed that CHIKV infection led to p53
 accumulation at 24 hpi. The positive control of p53 stabilization was obtained by the treatment
 of LHCN-M2 with 0.8 μM of doxorubicin which induced DNA damage.

Figure 27: The efficient infection and replication of CHIKV in LHCN-M2 cells was
associated with p53 stabilization. The LHCN-M2 cells were infected with CHIKV at MOI 0.1.
At different time points post infection, cells were either collected and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for viral capsid immunostaining (A.) or collected for RT-qPCR assay
(B.), or protein expression by western blot (C.).
A. CHIKV infection kinetics in LHCN-M2. Cells were infected with CHIKV, fixed in 4 % PFA at
    different time points before immunostaining with a primary antibody raised against SFV
    nucleocapsid protein (SFV-C antibody) which reacts with the CHIKV capsid protein, and then
    analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. Data are the mean ± SD of three independent
    experiments.
B. CHIKV replication analysis in LHCN-M2. Cells were infected with CHIKV, then harvested at
    different time points post infection with Buffer RA1 (Macherey Nagel) supplemented with β-
    mercaptoethanol, after which viral replication was analyzed by RT-qPCR. The quantification
    of CHIKV nsp2 RNA was measured and normalized on housekeeping gene 5S rRNA (n=2).
C. CHIKV capsid expression and p53 protein stabilization in LHCN-M2 at 24 hpi. SFV-C mouse
    antibody was used to detect CHIKV capsid and p53 DO-1 mouse antibody was used to
    detect p53 protein stabilization in CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2. The antibody raised against
    housekeeping protein β-actin was used as an internal control (n=3).

gene mRNA expression involved in cell cycle arrest (P21 and GADD45) and apoptosis (PUMA,
BAX and anti-apoptotic BCL-2), and the interferon beta (IFNβ) expression and IFN Type-I
signaling pathway by targeting Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs: MX1 and IFIT1) over time
(Figure 28 A. and B.). We observed no significant regulation of Bcl-2, p21, Gadd45 and Bax
mRNA. However, the Puma mRNA seemed to be upregulated at 24 hours post infection but the
results were not significant because of the variability of the data (Figure 28 A.). From 12 to 36
hours post infection, the targets genes tended to decrease during CHIKV infection. In parallel,
IFNβ mRNA and Interferon stimulated genes Mx1 and IFIT1 increased drastically from 12 to 36
hours post infection (Figure 28 B.).
The infection of LHCN-M2 with CHIKV at MOI 0,1 induced the production of IFNβ and the Type-
I interferon signaling pathway, whereas the cell cycle genes and apoptotic genes dependent on
p53 transcription were not transcriptionally induced. Then, as we observed p53 accumulation,
we generated p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to investigate its
potential activity.

             Effect of LHCN-M2 p53 deletion on CHIKV infection and cellular outcome


                      Generation of p53 knockout LHCN-M2 (sgRNA_p53) and luciferase
                      (sgRNA_luc) control cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 technology

To investigate the role of p53 protein in LHCN-M2 infected by CHIKV we generated p53
knockout LHCN-M2 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. To avoid off-targets, sgRNAs were
designed with the lowest risk of off-target score and the highest efficiency score. To start, we
wanted to study the role of p53 without looking in detail at the different p53 isoforms. Thus,
the induction of double-strand DNA damage was managed at the level of the first promoter of
the p53 gene, upstream and downstream of ATG40 (Figure 29). We thought this would damage
the promoter part of the coding transcript of full-length p53 and ∆40p53. We were not able to
correctly target the short promoter region of ∆133p53, considering the necessary
characteristics of single guide RNA design. Thus, we decided not to consider the ∆133p53
isoform. The transcript of the ∆133p53 isoform could theoretically be expressed in cells.
Next, each sgRNA was annealed and then cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 vector and used for
the generation of VSVg pseudo-particles which allow the insertion of the sgRNA-Cas9 sequence
into the LHCN-M2 genome thanks to the flanked HIV-LTR. Adherent LHCN-M2s were transduced
with pseudo-particles containing specific sgRNA-Cas9 and 24 hours later selected with
puromycin antibiotic treatment. To increase the efficiency of p53 knockout, both sgRNAs (400
and 402) were co-transduced (Figure 29 A.).

The CRISPR/Cas9 control cell line was generated by transduction of the sgRNA targeting
luciferase gene. Indeed, luciferase comes from the firefly and the sgRNA luciferase (sgRNA_luc)
is theoretically not able to target human genes. Thus, the LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc cell line
underwent different steps for the generation of CRISPR-mediated knockout without presenting
a specific protein knockout. After antibiotic selection, the cells were cultured for one week
before the analysis of the p53 profile by Western blot.

In order to be sure of the knockout, the LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 cells were treated with
doxorubicin to detect possible p53 stabilization after DNA-damage (Figure 29 B.). These results
showed an undetectable level of p53 protein and accumulation after doxorubicin treatment,
suggesting a loss of p53 expression in the LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 cell line. The generation of
control CRISPR LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc cell line presented a higher quantity of p53 protein in
untreated cells and a higher p53 stabilization after doxorubicin treatment, compared to treated
LHCN-M2 WT. As the CRSIPR/Cas9 system is based on double-strand DNA breaks, integrated in
the host genome and constitutively active, it seemed that the double-strand breaks induced by
Cas9 could activate the p53 signaling pathway after DNA-damage detection. Indeed, it has been
recently demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 technology induces a p53-mediated cell cycle arrest
through the p53-p21-pRb axis (Haapaniemi et al. 2018).

Moreover, we compared the cell viability of LHCN-M2 WT, sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 by ATP
quantification using the CellTiter-Glo® luminescent assay kit (Promega). We observed that cell
viability and growth in sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 were higher than LHCN-M2 WT but the
differences were not significant (Figure 29 C.). Observation under the microscope of cellular
morphology at 48 hours post-seeding showed a similar density of sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53
cells compared to WT cells (Figure 29 D.).

Taken together, these results first indicated that we generated a p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cell
line without any detectable p53 protein and p53 protein isoforms, using two different
antibodies which recognize all p53 isoforms as targeting a DNA-binding domain. These results
also indicated that it seemed essential to have this CRISPR/Cas9 control sgRNA_luc cell line to
analyze the effect of specific protein knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, especially for our
investigation into the transcriptional factor p53 function during CHIKV infection.

After the generation and validation of p53 knockout LHCN-M2, the first objective was to study
the effect of p53 knockout on CHIKV infection.

                      Infection of p53 knockout LHCN-M2 with CHIKV


LHCN-M2 WT, sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 were infected with CHIKV at MOI 0.1 at several time
points (from 2 hours to 48 hours) and the intracellular viral capsid was detected by
immunostaining. The percentage of infected cells was analyzed by flow cytometry assay.
The results showed that the susceptibility of LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 was significantly higher than
sgRNA_luc and WT infected cell lines from 6 to 36 hours (Figure 30 A.). Viral production was
assessed by TCID50/ml on VeroE6 and showed that more infectious particles were produced
from sgRNA_p53 than WT and control sgRNA_luc cell lines (Figure 30 B.). Viral replication was
evaluated by RT-qPCR targeting a fragment of nsP2 sequence. The viral fragment was
normalized either on a gene transcribed by Polymerase III (5S rRNA) to take into account the
cellular transcriptional shut-off mediated by viral nsP2 through the degradation of subunit RPB1
of Polymerase II (Figure 30 C.), or on housekeeping genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (the
average expression of GUSB, RPL22 and RPL27- Figure 30 D.). The quantity of nsp2 RNA
normalized on 5S rRNA mRNA showed no differences in viral replication comparing the three
cell lines, whereas the normalization on the average expression of gusb, rpl22 and rpl27 mRNA
demonstrated a higher viral replication in sgRNA_p53 than in sgRNA_luc. Given that CHIKV nsP2
induces the degradation of subunit RPB1 of RNA polymerase II, the housekeeping genes
transcribed by RNA polymerase II decreased drastically from 12 hpi but not the 5S rRNA as
transcribed by RNA polymerase III (data not shown). Using 5S rRNA transcribed by RNA
polymerase III we obtained a constant expression level of the housekeeping gene between
mock and infected cells. We suggest using housekeeping genes transcribed by polymerase II
because it is representative of the state of the cell. However, we decided to normalize the viral
and cellular RNA on housekeeping gene 5S rRNA for the following experiments.

                       Effect of p53 knockout on cell viability and p53-target genes during
                       CHIKV infection



To investigate the impact of p53 knockout on cell viability and cytopathicity during CHIKV
infection, we examined cell viability using the CellTiter-Glo® luminescent assay kit (Promega)
and we observed cellular morphology and cytopathic effects under the microscope (Figure 31
A. and B.).


The cell growth of CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 decreased significantly from 24 to 48
hpi compared to LHCN-M2 WT and sgRNA_luc (Figure 31 A.) and this result is associated with
larger observable CPE in CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 from 24 hpi (Figure 31 B.). Taken
together, these results showed that p53 knockout enhances CHIKV infection and impairs cell
viability, suggesting an antiviral effect of p53 protein during CHIKV infection.
In parallel, we investigated the regulation of p53-target genes involved either in cell cycle arrest
(P21, GADD45) or in pro- or anti-apoptotic response (Bax, PUMA and Bcl-2). Our data (Figure
32) showed no significant differences in the regulation of the five target genes in infected
sgRNA_p53 compared to sgRNA_luc.


In conclusion, the increase of cellular mortality in p53 knockout infected cells and the absence
of specific p53-target gene regulation, suggests a protective role of p53 and that CHIKV-
mediated cell death is p53-independent or engages other p53-target genes.

Thus, the p53 knockout of infected cells impaired the production of interferon and the induction
of Type-I signaling pathway after CHIKV infection. However, it was necessary to investigate the
capability of LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 to produce and respond to interferon to understand which
step of the p53-dependent immune response was blocked in our cellular model during CHIKV
infection.

                      Capacity of p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cells to induce the Type-I
                      interferon signaling pathway


We next explored the capacity of p53 knockout LHCN-M2 to induce Type-I interferon expression
and signaling pathway. To do this, LHCN-M2 WT, sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 were transfected
with an RIG-I CARD plasmid expressing only two CARDs domains, allowing the activation of the
signaling pathway for IFNβ production. Indeed, RIG-I includes two caspase activation and
recruitment domains (CARDs), which are essential for interaction with mitochondrial antiviral
signaling protein MAVS and subsequently the production of IFNβ. We analyzed the mRNA
expression of IFNβ, Mx1 and IFIT1, 24 hpi (Figure 34 A.). The box above figure 34 shows the
workflow of the experiment schematically. Our data showed that the expression of the RIG-I
CARD domain induced Type-I interferon response only in LHCN-M2 WT and LHCN-M2
sgRNA_luc. In transfected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53, the expression of IFNβ mRNA was upregulated
at a weaker level compared to sgRNA_luc. However, the level of expression of Mx1 in
sgRNA_p53 was equivalent to sgRNA_luc after the transfection of 10 ng of plasmid RIG-I.

Then, we transfected cells with plasmid RIG-I CARDs, collected the supernatants of cells 24
hours post transfection (Figure 34 B.) and challenged the three cell lines. The three cell lines
challenged with supernatants of WT and sgRNA_luc transfected cells, were able to express Mx1,
whereas the three cell lines challenged with supernatant of sgRNA_p53 transfected cells, were
not able to induce the Type-I interferon signaling pathway.

These results suggest that the level of IFNβ in the supernatant of p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cells
was insufficient to induce Mx1 expression. Other repetitions are required; however, this
experiment suggests that LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 can induce interferon signaling after RIG-I CARD
domain expression but, curiously, it produces weaker and not sufficient IFNβ to induce Type-I
interferon signaling pathway.

In conclusion, the antiviral effect of p53 in LHCN-M2 during CHIKV infection seems to be
correlated to Type-I interferon response independently of its antiviral apoptotic function. The
impairment of p53 knockout cells to induce antiviral response seems to be dependent on IFNβ
production and not on the expression of ISGs genes Mx1 and IFIT1.




                      Effect of p53 knockout on CHIKV-induced cell death


We have shown that more p53 knockout cells are infected by CHIKV compared to sgRNA_luc
cells. Moreover, more p53 knockout cells undergo cell death and cannot induce Type-I
interferon response after CHIKV infection. Thus, we suggest that in infected control sgRNA_luc
cells, the uninfected neighboring cells were protected against CHIKV infection and virus-
induced cell death, possibly due to the activation of the interferon Type-I signaling pathway.

As the infected p53 knockout cells presented earlier cytopathic effects (CPE) compared to the
control sgRNA_luc infected cells, we detected the cleavage of PARP (an indicator of late
apoptosis and activation of capase-3) and the expression of Bax (an indicator of mitochondrial
apoptosis). In addition, the expression of the viral capsid of CHIKV and p53 accumulation were
obtained (Figure 35). The western blot presented below is representative of what we observed
in three separate experiments for the viral capsid, p53 and PARP but not the expression of Bax
(n=1).

used to detect CHIKV, anti-p53 DO-1 to detect full-length p53 and anti-PARP. The antibody
raised to housekeeping protein β-actin was used as loading control.

Figure 37: Immunostaining of cleaved caspase-3 in CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc
and sgRNA_p53 and flow cytometry analysis (n=1).
LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 cells were infected with CHIKV at MOI 0.1 and fixed at
different times post infection for immunostaining, targeting cleaved caspase-3 (anti-cleaved
caspase-3 Asp175, #9664 CST). The percentage of positive cells was detected by flow
cytometry.



First, the viral capsid expression in CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 showed
a higher quantity of capsid in sgRNA_p53 cells from 12-16 hours post infection compared to
sgRNA_luc. The result of the Western blot assays was correlated to that of the flow cytometry

                                                                                                       135


assay on the percentage of infected cells (cf. Figure 30), with a higher quantity of CHIKV capsid
and earlier detection in sgRNA_p53 compared to sgRNA_luc. Moreover, we observed an
additional 25 kDa capsid form, from 16 hpi, only in the infected p53 knockout cells. This 25 kDa
capsid form was not detectable in infected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc from 16 to 36 hpi.

Secondly, the stabilization of p53 was analyzed using the DO-1 antibody which recognizes only
full-length p53 as the epitope is localized in the first TAD domain. On looking at the three
independent experiments, the profile of p53 stabilization in uninfected and infected LHCN-M2
sgRNA_luc presented a general trend with less accumulation in infected cells at early infection
(from 2 to 12 hpi) and then higher accumulation in infected cells (from 12 to 36 hpi), compared
to uninfected cells.

In addition, the inactive form of PARP (89 kDa) in CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 was
detectable much earlier, at 16 hpi, and increased overtime until 36 hpi, compared to sgRNA_luc
where we observed the cleaved form at 36 hpi only once. Previously, the infection of LHCN-M2
WT cells with CHIKV at MOI 1 showed the inactive form of PARP at 48 hours post infection
(Figure 36). Maybe that in CHIKV-infected sgRNA_luc the cleavage of PARP will be detectable
after 36 hours of infection and thus correlated to the percentage of infected cells.

Moreover, the expression of Bax was analyzed only once because we observed several
confusing regulations overtime. Bax is found in the cytosol and, upon the initiation of apoptotic
signaling, it undergoes a conformational shift and is integrated in the membrane of the
mitochondria, forming channels and leading to the release of cytochrome c. Thus, the
expression of Bax seems difficult to analyze, which is why we detected the release of the
cytochrome from the mitochondria by fluorescent microscopy assay.

Finally, PARP can be cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis. Thus, we analyzed the cleavage of
caspase-3 by immunostaining and flow cytometry assay (Figure 37). Our data showed that no
cleavage of caspase-3 was detected in sgRNA_luc infected cells, whereas the cleavage of
caspase-3 was detected in sgRNA_p53 infected from 24 to 36 hpi with around 20% of the total
population positive.

Taken together, these results first suggests that the stabilization of p53 seems regulated over
time (degraded in the early stage of infection and then stabilized in the late stage of infection),
maybe by the infection and second, p53 depletion induces an earlier inactivation of PARP

                                                                                               136


maybe cleaved by caspase-3 during CHIKV infection, supporting the previous results on cell
viability and cellular morphology, thereby indicating an antiviral role of the p53 protein allowing
the delay of CHIKV-induced cell death.



                      Nuclear translocation of p53 and NF-κB during CHIKV infection


As p53 is a transcription factor and can be subjected to several different post-translational
modifications guiding its response and nuclear translocation, it seems important to analyze if
its stabilization during CHIKV infection around 16 and 24 hpi promotes its nuclear localization.
To this end, we decided to test the nuclear translocation of p53 using the subcellular
fractionation technique and SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 38). The aim was to separate the nucleus
and cytoplasm of uninfected and infected LHCN-M2 cells and first detect the viral capsid and
second the distribution and accumulation of p53 between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
Moreover, using this technique, we investigated the nuclear translocation of transcription
factor NF-κB which is involved in interferon Type-I production after the detection of viral RNA
through RLRs and TLRs. In parallel, we tried to detect p53 using the immunostaining method
and confocal microscopy analysis to have a second and more qualitative method of detection.
Unfortunately, in the preliminary data, the detection of p53 in LHCN-M2 was not a success (data
not shown) and different protocols are now being formulated.

Figure 38 A. shows the subcellular fractionation of LHCN-M2 WT, sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53
infected with CHIKV with MOI 0.1 at 24 hpi. Ffigure 38 B. presents the subcellular fractionation
of sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 cells infected with CHIKV at MOI 0.1 and cell lysates collected at
8, 16 and 24 hpi. The complete separation of fractions was confirmed for targeting tubulin and
lamin A for the identification of cytoplasm and nucleus fractions, respectively. Figure 38 C.
shows the nucleus/cytoplasm ratio of p53 and NF-κB.

Targeting the CHIKV viral capsid, we could clearly observe a dissimilarity between LHCN-M2 WT
and LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc. We observed less p53 accumulation in infected LHCN-M2 WT
compared to sgRNA_luc. Moreover, we observed p53 in the nucleus of infected sgRNA_luc but
not in WT cells. Then, we observed a higher quantity of capsid in the nucleic fraction of infected
p53 knockout cells compared to the nucleic fraction of sgRNA_luc. Finally, the 25 kDa capsid
form was also detected only in infected sgRNA_p53, in both fractions.

   The cytoplasmic and nucleic fractions were separated as described in materials and method
   and then the same volume of different fractions was loaded on SDS-PAGE for Western blot
   assay. Viral capsid SFV-C antibody was used to detect CHIKV, anti-p53 DO-1 to detect full-
   length p53 and anti-NF-κB/p65 to detect NF-κB. The antibodies raised against housekeeping
   proteins Tubulin and Lamin A were used as loading and separating fraction controls.

The detection of p53 showed a higher accumulation and nuclear translocation in infected LHCN-
M2 WT and sgRNA_luc compared to uninfected cell lines at 24 hpi. Moreover, the accumulation
in infected sgRNA_luc was higher than in WT cells. These observations suggest that p53 is
stabilized and translocated to the nucleus of CHIKV-infected sgRNA_luc.

The detection of the transcription factor NF-κB first showed a higher quantity in the cytoplasm
of uninfected cells than in the nucleus compared to infected cells. Then, we observed that in
sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 infected cells, the quantity of NF-κB was higher in the nucleus than
in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the densitometry analysis of the second experiment (Figure 38 C.)
showed a higher increase of NF-κB detection in the nucleus of infected sgRNA_luc compared to
the nuclear fraction of infected sgRNA_p53.
These results suggest that NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus of both cell lines during CHIKV
infection, but the depletion of p53 impairs its nuclear translocation. This experiment must be
repeated to support this observation.


                      Effect of p53 knockout on the release of cytochrome c during CHIKV

In order to strengthen the subcellular fractionation results on viral capsid distribution in both
fractions (cytoplasm and nucleus) and to obtain an image of individual infected cells, the
distribution of CHIKV capsid in LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 cells was studied by
fluorescence imaging microscopy. Moreover, in order to investigate the involvement of
mitochondria during CHIKV-induced cell death we set-up the detection of cytochrome c release
(Figure 39).

In sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 uninfected cells, we observed punctuated staining of cytochrome
c in the cytoplasm and perinuclear zone, suggesting a mitochondrial localization of cytochrome
c. In contrast, the two infected cells showed diffuse staining of cytochrome c, indicating its
release in the cytoplasm at 24 hpi. In addition, by analyzing the DAPI fluorescence, we observed
that in the sgRNA_luc cells, the nucleus was smooth in mock conditions while the chromatin
was condensed in infected conditions. Finally, in infected sgRNA_p53 cells, we detected higher
chromatin condensation compared to infected sgRNA_luc cells, visualized by DAPI staining.

Figure 39: Analysis of CHIKV capsid and cytochrome c distribution in LHCN-M2
sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 by fluorescence imaging microscopy. Cells were infected with
CHIKV at MOI 0.1 for 24 hours and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The viral capsid and
cytochrome c were co-immunostained and the nucleus counterstained with DAPI. The targeted
proteins and DAPI were visualized by fluorescent microscopy assay (Obj. x40), (n=1).

The staining of the nucleus in infected sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 cell lines showed fewer
sgRNA_p53 cells on several panels during acquisition compared to sgRNA_luc, due to more
dead cells. The flow cytometry results showed a higher percentage of infected sgRNA_p53 cells
than sgRNA_luc cells and the microscopy analysis showed diffuse staining of capsid in the
cytoplasm of infected sgRNA_luc and greater intensity for stained capsid in sgRNA_p53 around
the nucleus. Thus, the microscopy analysis did not confirm the results obtained by flow
cytometry, perhaps due to the difference in the technique used. Thus, the experiment should
be repeated. In conclusion, this result suggests that during CHIKV infection the mitochondria
seemed to be involved in virus-induced cell death.

                      Discussion


The role of p53 protein during CHIKV infection in human LHCN-M2 cells has never been
investigated. However, it has been shown that p53 can be involved in several different viral
replication cycles as mentioned in the introduction of the manuscript. In our study, we
investigated and showed an antiviral role of p53 in CHIKV infection in a human immortalized
LHCN-M2 muscle cell line. Then, we studied the signaling pathway mediated by p53 during
CHIKV infection and showed its influence on Type-I interferon production and/or signaling
pathway independently of its apoptotic response.


We have initially showed that LHCN-M2 WT cells were permissive to CHIKV which led to
considerable viral replication and cytopathic effects until the complete destruction of the cell
layer. Moreover, we demonstrated the stabilization of full-length p53 in CHIKV-infected LHCN-
M2 WT cells and its nuclear translocation. In addition, we demonstrated an increase of Type I
interferon production and signaling pathway. In parallel, we did not observe the induction of
two specific p53 target genes that are involved in the induction of apoptosis. This result is in
accordance with a publication that showed that infection with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) induced
p53-independent apoptosis (Glasgow et al. 1998).


Then, to go further we generated p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.
We demonstrated a higher percentage of CHIKV-infected sgRNA_p53 cells compared to
sgRNA_luc control cells. The increase in the viral infection of sgRNA_p53 was linked to more
significant cytopathic effects and a decrease in cell viability. The CHIKV-infected sgRNA_p53 was
not able to express the IFNβ transcript and the ISGs genes, Mx1 and IFIT1. Interestingly, the
analysis of five p53 target genes (P21, GADD45, PUMA, Bax, Bcl-2) showed no activations during
infection. In conclusion, during CHIKV infection of a human immortalized LHCN-M2 skeletal
muscle cell line, the p53 protein plays an antiviral role influencing antiviral immunity
independently of its antiviral apoptotic response. To confirm this hypothesis, we must first
know if the p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cell line can induce an efficient Type-I interferon signalling
pathway. To test the capacity of the sgRNA_p53 cell line to produce IFNβ and activate the Type
I interferon signalling pathway and respond to IFNβ detection on receptor IFNARs, we
transfected cells with plasmid expressing only the two CARDS of RIG-I, allowing the constant

                                                                                             141


activation of IRF3/IRF7 and the subsequent expression of IFNβ. Interestingly, it seems that
sgRNA_p53 cells express less IFNβ mRNA than sgRNA_luc and WT transfected cell lines.
However, all the three different cell lines expressed Mx1 at the same level.


We tested the capacity of p53 knockout cells to produce IFNβ in their supernatant and activated
the Type I interferon signalling pathway to neighbouring cells. It seemed that p53 knockout cells
could not produce IFNβ in their supernatant, however, they could respond to the IFNβ and
induce the activation of the Type I interferon signalling pathway.
Considering that LHCN cell lines are hard-to-transfect, it could be interesting to use Polyinosinic-
polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)). Indeed, poly(I-C) is a synthetic analogue of double strand RNA
(dsRNA) recognized by TLR3, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of transcription
factors IRF3/7 and NF-κB.
p53 could be involved in the expression of one or several factors of the TLR3-TRIF pathway or
RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS pathway during CHIKV infection, thus explaining the inability of p53
knockout cells to produce IFNβ. In the absence of IFNβ in the supernatant of CHIKV-infected
LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 cells, the signal to protect nearby uninfected cells is absent, possibly
explaining why more p53 knockout cells are infected. To test this hypothesis, we are analysing
the expression level of different p53 target genes such as TLR3 or IRF9 and the activation of
transcription factor IRF3 by phosphorylation detection. In addition, we are monitoring the
capacity of IFNβ in the supernatant of sgRNA_luc control cells mediated by p53 during CHIKV to
protect the neighbouring cells from infection. To do this, the supernatant of infected sgRNA_luc
cells will be collected and filtered to retain the CHIKV particles and recover the supernatant
with IFNβ secreted on the uninfected sgRNA_p53 cells which are able to induce the expression
of ISGs. After being challenged with this supernatant, the p53 knockout cells will be infected
with CHIKV and the rate of viral replication and interferon Type-I signalling pathway will be
compared to sgRNA_luc cells. We assume that the IFNβ secreted by infected cells on nearby
uninfected cells could delay the cell death observed in p53 knockout infected cells.


It has been demonstrated that TLR3 can be regulated by p53 in HCT116 epithelial cells by
binding to the p53 consensus site in the TLR3 promoter in response to poly(I-C) (Taura et al.
2008). Furthermore, TLR3 regulates antiviral immunity in CHIKV infection in primary fibroblasts
in humans and mice (Her et al. 2015). These data allow us to propose for our analysis the

                                                                                                142


influence of p53 for the expression of TLR3, leading to the recognition of CHIKV in early
endosomes, and subsequently the expression of IFNβ. To test this hypothesis, it would be
interesting to explore the expression level of TLR3 mRNA and the status of IRF3 phosphorylation
in CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc cells and sgRNA_p53 cells.
The comparison of NF-κB translocation to the nucleus in sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53 cells
showed less NF-κB in the nucleus of p53 knockout infected cells. The p53 and NF-κB pathways
can crosstalk and in the absence of p53, the activation and translocation of NF-κB is reduced
during CHIKV infection. NF-κB can protect against or contribute to apoptosis and our data
suggest that the reduction of NF-κB is correlated to an increase in viral replication and virus-
induced cell death.
Using fluorescent microscopy analysis, it would be interesting to double stain the viral capsid of
CHIKV with TLR3, RIG-I or transcription factors (IRF3 and NF- κB) and thus examine if p53
stabilization occurs in infected cells and leads to the induction of TLR3 pathways and IFNβ
expression.


We observed a decrease in p53 stabilization from 2 to almost 12 hours in CHIKV-infected
sgRNA_luc cells compared to mock cells, suggesting that viral infection induced a degradation
of p53. CHIKV could control the immune response dependent on p53 at the early stage of
infection and perform efficient viral replication to produce new particles. The viral proteins
involved in the degradation of p53 could be investigated to ascertain whether nsP2 or capsid
are responsible, because of their catalytic activity. To do this, we have already generated an
inducible cell line overexpressing CHIKV capsid and nsP2.

During the replicative cycle of alphaviruses, viral RNA is released and synthesized into the
cytoplasm of the infected cells. To study the replication of CHIKV we analysed the viral capsid
of CHIKV and showed a nuclear localization of the CHIKV capsid with a higher quantity of capsid
in the cytoplasm and nucleus of p53 knockout infected cells compared to sgRNA_luc cells. The
viral capsid is expressed in the cytoplasm and possesses a nuclear import signal NLS and two
nuclear export signals NESs (Thomas et al. 2013). The function of the Old-World arthritogenic
alphavirus (CHIKV, SINV, SFV or O’NNV) capsid and the importance of its nuclear transport are
not well studied. However, the investigations on New-World alphaviruses (VEEV and EEEV) have
revealed that the capsid induces the transcriptional shut-off of e infected cells by stopping


                                                                                              143


nuclear transport (Lundberg et al. 2017). The function of transcriptional shutoff is ensured by
the nuclear localization of the non-structural protein nsP2 in the replicative cycle of Old-World
alphaviruses.

Consequently, we could suggest that the higher quantity of viral capsid is a consequence of the
increase in viral infection or we could hypothesize that p53 directly or indirectly controls the
translocation of the CHIKV capsid to the nucleus. It could be interesting to monitor the
interaction between p53 and the CHIKV capsid by Immunoprecipitation. Moreover, during the
infection of p53 knockout cells, we observed a 25 kDa form of the viral capsid protein, in
addition to the 32 kDa full-length viral capsid, suggesting a degradative process of the viral
capsid. In parallel, we showed previously that the inducible overexpression of the capsid alone
in LHCN-M2 cells was principally associated with the detection of the 25 kDa form (data not
shown). To date, this is the first study to report such a cleaved form of the CHIKV capsid protein.


Concerning the type of cell death pathway engaged in CHIKV-infected LHCN-M2, we could not
conclude on which pathway is activated during CHIKV infection of LHCN-M2. We observed the
cleavage of PARP1 in LHCN-M2 WT cells at 48 hpi and in p53 knockout cells from 16 hpi. We
analysed the presence of cleaved caspase-3 by flow cytometry assay in sgRNA_luc and
sgRNA_p53 infected cells. Our data indicated the cleavage of caspase-3 in sgRNA_p53 infected
cells but not in sgRNA_luc cells. These data need to be confirmed and it would be interesting,
in parallel, to pre-treat the three LHCN-M2 cell lines with a caspase inhibitor. For example, QVD
is a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor that blocks caspases -8, -9, -10, -12, -3 and -7 and
subsequently inhibits apoptosis. It might be informative if the cell death induced in CHIKV-
infected cells is delayed and if the cleaved-PARP detected from 16 hours in p53 knockout
infected cells is still detectable from 16 hpi or delayed. In parallel, it might be interesting to
investigate the role of Inhibitors of Apoptosis proteins (IAP) in mammalian cells for their impact
on caspase inhibition. The mammalian IAP could be overexpressed and the effect on CHIKV
replication and infection analysed.


In brief, we showed that full-length p53 induces an antiviral response by influencing the Type-I
interferon production and signalling pathway of the immortalized human muscle cell line LHCN-
M2 infected with CHIKV. It seems that the virus-induced cell death is independent of p53 or


                                                                                               144


that other genes not targeted could be involved. Moreover, the influence of p53 in antiviral
response seems to be correlated to the production of IFNβ, maybe by transcription of important
factor(s) involved in the pathway from the detection of the viral RNA to the activation of
transcription factors such as IRF3/IRF7 or NF-κB. The exact mechanism by which p53 influences
the Type-I interferon production and signalling pathway needs to be studied further.



In insects: in Drosophila melanogaster p53 expression impacts the
    viral replication of CHIKV and SINV

Studies of the p53 protein function in the natural vector Aedes albopictus mosquito infected by
alphavirus and other arboviruses are scarce. The incomplete annotation of Ae. albopictus
genome makes the study of specific protein functions very difficult. Quite recently, two p53
paralogues in the Aedes mosquito species, named p53-1 and p53-2, were discovered using a
phylogenetic approach. Thanks to this discovery, it has been shown that infection of the
mosquito C636 cell line by Dengue virus induced the upregulation of p53-2 mRNA expression.
The upregulation of p53-2 mRNA was associated with antioxidant response during Dengue virus
infection and it has been hypothesized that p53-2 participated in the decrease of virus-induced
stress.

We decided to investigate the potential function of p53 protein during alphavirus infections in
vivo in the Drosophila melanogaster insect model because of the availability of genetic mutants
and better genetic characterization compared to the mosquito Aedes albopictus. Thanks to
collaboration with Professor Bertrand Mollereau (ENS, Lyon – LBMC, Apoptosis and
neurogenetics) we obtained two strains of drosophila: Drosophila melanogaster w1118
wildtype strain and a mutant p53-/- strain which presents a deletion on the p53 gene generated
by CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

Our first goal was to investigate the potential function of p53 in the CHIKV-infected Drosophila
melanogaster WT strains w1118 and p53-/- without considering p53 isoforms. The data in this
part present the effect of p53 deletion on the viral replication of CHIKV (and Sindbis virus), the
survival of flies injected with CHIKV, and the viral production of CHIKV.

              Detection of Wolbachia spp. in Drosophila w1118 and p53-/- strains


We first investigated the absence or presence of the bacteria Wolbachia spp. in the Drosophila
strains w1118 and p53-/- as it has been shown that the presence of the bacteria can interfere
with viral replication (Aliota et al. 2016). To do this, we carried out PCR on two females and one
male, using published primers as described in Material and methods which recognize several
different bacterial strains. The w1118 strain was positive but not the p53-/- strain for Wolbachia
spp. Thus, w1118 was treated with 5mg/ml of Tetracycline for two generations (Figure 40 A.)
and we confirmed the elimination of bacteria with the same PCR (Figure 40 B.). The detection
of bacteria was carried out regularly as it has been shown that flies can be recolonized by
Wolbachia via the external environment.

p53-/- mutant strains (A.) and tetracycline treatment (B.). Two females and one male were
selected randomly and crushed to monitor specific PCR targeting several different Wolbachia
strains using wsp81Fw 5’- TGGTCCAATAAGTGATGAAGAAAC-3’ and wsp691Rv 5’-
AAAAATTAAACGCTACTCCA-3’ (W. Zhou et al. 1998).

The survival of flies injected with 200 pfu of CHIKV solution or mock solution was investigated
to analyze the impact of p53 deletion on virus-induced stress (Figure 41). First, the injection of
the mock solution in both strains did not impact the survival of flies. Interestingly, five days after
the injection of w1118 with 200 pfu of CHIKV, fifty percent of the flies died, and the other fifty
percent survived till the end of the experiment (day 20). In parallel, the survival of p53-/-

injected with CHIKV decreased drastically from 6 to 15 days and all the injected flies were dead
at day 20. In conclusion, the p53 deletion impaired the survival of flies infected with CHIKV.
Next, we investigated the viral replication of CHIKV and SINV and the viral production of CHIKV
to know if the death of p53-/- flies was due to a higher viral replication during the first day.
Thus, we focused our analysis on 2 to 4 days post-injection, when the survival was comparable
between the two strains (Figure 41).

drawn with GraphPad Prism 6 software (Kaplan-Meier survival plot).

                       and p53-/- strains


About 15 male flies aged 3 to 6 days were collected in culture medium tubes and injected with
200 pfu of SINV or CHIKV.

First, we did not detect significant differences in SINV replication, using RT-qPCR analysis, in the
w1118 strain compared to the p53-/- strain (from 36 to 72 hours post-injections). Interestingly,
from 72 to 96 hours post-injection the SINV replication in w1118 strain increased 4-fold
compared to the mock w1118 strain and in p53-/- only once leading to a significant difference
in SINV replication between w1118 and p53-/- at 96 hours. This first result suggested a negative
impact of p53 deletion on SINV replication.


                                                                                                147


Next, the same experiment been performed twice with CHIKV but for a shorter time course (72)
for practical reasons (Figure 42 A.). At 72 hours post-injection, we obtained two contradictory
results with one experiment showing higher CHIKV replication in the wildtype w1118 strain
compared to the p53-/- strain and another experiment indicating no differences between the
two strains. These two experiments suggested that we should analyze this viral replication over
a longer kinetic (96h) to consolidate the difference between the two strains.

In addition, we investigated the capacity of producing new infectious particles for the
dissemination of CHIKV by the two different strains. To do this, a TCID50/mL analysis was
carried out (Figure 42 B.). We observed considerable production of new infectious particles
from day 2 to day 4 in the w1118 strain. In the p53-/- strain, it seemed that between day 1 to
day 4, there was a production of new CHIKV infectious particles after which production
increased from day 4 to day 8, but at a lower rate in the p53-/- strain compared to the w1118
strain. As the experiment of TCID50 was monitored only once, it must be repeated to
consolidate this data. Taken all together, these results suggest that p53 is necessary for the
survival of infected flies and for the viral replication of SINV and CHIKV.

                      Discussion


The CHIKV and SINV replicated more efficiently in the w1118 strain than in the p53-/- strain. In
addition, the CHIKV-infected w1118 strain produced more infectious particles compared to the
p53-/- strain. The deletion of p53 seemed to impair the start of viral replication and production
but did not definitively inhibit viral replication over time. To be complete, this study with CHIKV
                                                                                               149


should be repeated at least twice, adding the time point 96 hours post-injection for viral
replication analysis. Nevertheless, all the infected p53-/- flies died at 15 days, while the w1118
flies presented 50 percent of survivors. Based on these data, we proposed different hypotheses
based on the different roles of p53 and p53 isoforms on signaling pathways.

The first is based on the demonstration of antioxidant response induced by a p53 isoform in
mosquito cells infected with Dengue virus (Chen et al. 2018). Indeed, Chen and colleagues have
shown that only one of the two isoforms discovered in mosquito, called p53-2, was upregulated
during Dengue virus infection and involved in the transcription of an antioxidant enzyme,
catalase, allowing the control of cellular stress induced by the viral infection. Moreover, the
p53-2 knockdown in infected C6/36 cells increased the cell death rate and decreased the
expression of catalase. In addition, the over-expression of p53-2 decreased the cell death rate
in infected C6/36 cells.

The second is based on the induction of autophagy by the p53 isoform in Drosophila. In
Drosophila, among the four p53 isoforms described, two were studied in greater depth, i.e. p53
A and B. It was shown that only isoform A is involved in mediating the apoptotic response to
DNA damage (Zhang et al. 2015). The p53 isoforms A and B could regulate opposite signaling
pathways, apoptosis, and autophagy, differentially (Robin et al. 2019). The treatment of
Drosophila p53-/- with ROS inducer (paraquat) was associated with a higher rate of mortality,
higher caspase activation and impaired autophagic flux. Whereas isoform A inhibited
autophagic flux, isoform B presented a protective response with a functional autophagic flux.

The Drosophila p53-/- strain did not express isoform A or B. The mortality rate of the p53-/-
infected strain was higher and viral replication/production was impaired compared to the
w1118 infected strain.



Firstly, we hypothesize that in the absence of one or two p53 isoforms, the antioxidant response
induced during CHIKV infection could not be activated. In this way, the virus-induced stress
increased and could not be controlled, inducing the impairment of viral replication, the
accumulation of ROS, and then the death of the flies.

Secondly, we suggest that during SINV and CHIKV infection of Drosophila, autophagy could
impact viral replication positively and be influenced by the activity of the p53 isoform. Given
                                                                                              150


that following stress induction (comparable to viral infection), the p53 B isoform presented a
protective response and a functional autophagic flux, we hypothesize that during SINV and
CHIKV infection, the p53 B-dependent autophagy participated in efficient viral replication and
increased the survival of the flies. It could be interesting to test this hypothesis, first by
analyzing the survival of the flies after the infection of different p53 isoform mutants strains:
Drosophila p53 A -/- (express the isoform B) and Drosophila p53 B-/- ( express the isoform A).
In this case, it would be expected that the survival of the D. melanogaster p53 B-/- strain would
decrease compared to the w1118 strain and that of the p53 A-/- strain would be comparable to
the w1118 strain. Then, the analysis of viral replication by RT-qPCR might indicate whether the
expression of p53 B isoform is correlated to a higher viral replication compared to the viral
replication rate in p53 -/- and p53 B -/- strains.




As Drosophila melanogaster is not the natural vector of CHIKV, the question of resistance and
permissiveness is interesting to discuss because it has recently been proposed that a rapid
apoptotic response mediated by p53 could be associated with the resistance of the vector by
the inhibition of viral propagation, whereas the inhibition of apoptosis and the engagement of
innate immune response following necrotic cell death could be linked to permissiveness (Liu et
al. 2013). Thus, based on our hypothesis, p53 seems important for the efficient infection of
Drosophila, rendering this in vivo model interesting and useful for genetic investigations.
However, thanks to the development and requirement of effective tools for genome editing in
the mosquito Aedes aegypti, it seems that the next important investigation will be on in vivo
mosquitoes infected with alphaviruses by blood feeding.

In mosquito cells: Infection of mosquito Aedes albopictus and Aedes
   aegypti cell lines with CHIKV

Results and discussion

             Effect of the origin of CHIKV production on the permissiveness and pro-
             apoptotic response of mosquito cell lines


As presented in the introduction of the manuscript, the functional role of apoptosis in mediating
insect immunity and/or participating in viral infection has been a topic of debate. Moreover,
although insects present an immunological memory (Flemming 2017), apoptosis plays an
important role in antiviral defense, maybe more effective than the antiviral effect in vertebrate
hosts. Due to the difficulties of getting genetic tools to manipulate apoptotic response in
mosquitoes, we decided to investigate the cellular response of mosquito cell lines infected with
CHIKV, targeting the pro-apoptotic gene Michelob_mx identified with a bioinformatics
approach and verified as an orthologue of Drosophila IAP-antagonist genes (Zhou et al. 2005).
We also designed primers targeting the p53 transcript and verified their specificity using the
blast prediction tool and by obtaining a standard curve.

In addition, to “mimic” the primary infection of a mosquito cell following a blood meal taken
from a vertebrate host, we infected mosquito cells with chikungunya virus produced either in
mammalian cells (BHK21) or in mosquito cells (C636). Indeed, posttranslational modifications
of proteins in mosquito cells are different from those in mammalian cells. These post-
translational modifications occur in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus
involving N-glycosylation. Compared to mammals, whose glycosylation has been studied
extensively, the investigation of invertebrate glycosylation is limited. N-glycosylation refers to
the attachment of a glycan to a specific asparagine of proteins, producing glycoproteins with
variable extended glycan structures. The majority of secreted proteins and membrane are co-
translationally N-glycosylated (Zhu, Li, and Chen 2019). As the alphavirus’s glycoproteins are
transported in the ER and the Golgi apparatus of mammalian and mosquito cells and then
anchored in the plasma membrane of the two cells, the particles produced present different
glycoprotein structures and different lipidic membrane compositions. These differences could
have an impact on the entry process and replication and also on the cellular response after the


                                                                                              152


detection of the viral genome. Thus, when mosquito cells are infected with a particle produced
in a mammalian cell, viral replication and /or the cellular response could be different to the cell
response obtained after infection with a particle produced in a mosquito cell.

Considering that during the infection of a mosquito, the first ingested viral particles are derived
from a mammal host and then by new particles produced in its own cells, we infected three
different mosquito cell lines (C6/36, U4.4 and Aag2) with CHIKV produced either in the
mammalian BHK-21 cell line or in the C6/36 cell line at MOI 0.1. At 8, 24 and 48 hours post-
infection, the infected cells were collected and CHIKV replication was analyzed by RT-qPCR
(Figure 43).

We observed an increase of CHIKV replication according to the relative expression of CHIKV
nsp2 in the three cell lines tested (Aedes albopictus C6/36 , Aedes albopictus U4.4, Aedes
aegypti Aag2) from 8 to 48 hours post infection, and this increase was the same for both viruses
tested. However, analyzing the quantity of viral RNA in the three cell lines, we observed that at
24 hours post infection, the viral RNA reached a value between 600 -800 in C6/36, a value of
100 in Aag2 and a very low level of expression in U4.4 with 4-6. Thus, the three cell lines seemed
to be permissive to CHIKV, however they did not allow the viral replication at the same level.
The differences between C6/36 and U4.4 could be explained by the dysfunctional antiviral RNAi
pathway in C6/36 at the origin of a premature stop codon in the dcr-2 gene (Brackney et al.
2010). Interestingly, in Aag2, which are Dcr-2 competent cells, the amount of CHIKV nsp2 RNA
was higher than that of U4.4 (Dcr-2 competent) cells and less than that of C6/36 cells. Given
that Aedes aegypti is the major vector of CHIKV, we suggest that the CHIKV is well adapted to
Aag2 cells. However, this experiment was conducted only once, so it must be repeated to
confirm the trend observed.

Figure 43: Comparison of CHIKV replication in Aedes albopictus (U4.4 and C6/36) and
Aedes aegypti (Aag2) mosquito cells lines with CHIKV produced in mammalian BHK-21
and mosquito C6/36 cells. The mosquito cell lines were infected with CHIKV produced in BHK-
21 and C6/36 cells at MOI 0.1 and collected for RT-qPCR analysis at 8, 24- and 48-hours post
infection. The expression level of CHIKV nsp2 was measured by RT-qPCR and normalized on
the housekeeping genes actin and rpl8 (n=1).


Then, using the three cell lines we investigated the effect of CHIKV-BHK21 and CHIKV-C6/36
infection on p53 expression and the p53-target gene Michelob_mx. First, we tried to detect
Aedes p53 protein by Western blot using several antibodies (DO-1, CM1 and DO-11 cf. “List of
primary antibodies used for Western blot” in Material and methods) but unfortunately none of
them worked (data not shown).
Next, the regulation of p53 and mx mRNA was carried out by RT-qPCR. Since the genome of
Aedes albopictus remains sparsely annotated the primers targeting p53 mRNA were validated
by prediction and mx mRNA discovered by bioinformatics analysis (Zhou et al. 2005). We
treated the cells with doxorubicin which induces DNA damage in mammal cells leading to the
stabilization of the p53 protein and increasing the expression of p53-target genes, orthologues
of mx. We treated cells with doxorubicin to obtain a positive control for mx upregulation and
ensure confidence in the primers used. The results showed that treatment with doxorubicin
induced different profiles of p53 and mx mRNA regulation over time in the three cell lines
(Figure 44). In the C6/36 cell line, treatment with doxorubicin induced a one-fold increase of
p53 at 8 hours and an increase in mx expression at 48 hours. In U4.4, the expression of p53
mRNA increased at 24 and 48 hours and mx mRNA increased at 8 and 48 hours. In Aag2, the
doxorubicin treatment tended to decrease p53 and mx mRNA expression. This experiment was
conducted only once, so it must be repeated to confirm the trend observed and conclude on
the efficiency of doxorubicin as a positive control in mosquito cell lines.

Then, we analyzed the cellular response following the infection of cells either with CHIKV-BHK21
or CHIKV-C6/36. The infection of C6/36 with CHIKV-BHK21 led to an increase of mx expression
at 8 hpi and 48 hpi with a decrease in the middle. Infection with CHIKV-C6/36 induced an
increase in mx expression at 24 and 48 hpi. In parallel, p53 gene expression increased slightly
at 8 hpi for both viruses and at a later time point the amounts were comparable to those of
mock cells.

mosquito cell lines infected by CHIKV produced in mammalian (BHK-21) and mosquito
(C6/36) cell lines (one experiment).
The mosquito cell lines were infected with CHIKV produced in BHK-21 and C6/36 cells at MOI
0.1 and collected for RT-qPCR analysis at 8, 24- and 48-hours post-infection. The expression
level of p53 and mx were measured by RT-qPCR and normalized against the housekeeping
genes actin and rpl8 before calculating the fold change, i.e. the ratio of the target gene in CHIKV
cells vs. mock cells. The mRNA level of mock cells was established at 1.




The infection of Aedes albopictus U4.4, dcr-2 competent cells with CHIKV-BHK21 led to the
upregulation of p53 mRNA, while infection with CHIKV-C6/36 induced the downregulation of
p53 mRNA. At 24 and 48 hpi, the amount of p53 mRNA remained higher in cells infected with
CHIKV- BHK21 than with CHIKV-C6/36. In parallel, the upregulation of p53 mRNA in CHIKV-
BHK21-infected cells was not associated with an increase of mx transcript. In addition, the



                                                                                               155


expression of mx mRNA decreased drastically from 8 to 24 hours for both viruses and then
returned to a value close to the mock condition.


Regarding the infection of the Aedes aegypti Aag2 cell line, we observed a downwards trend in
the p53 transcript from 8 to 48 hpi in CHIKV-BHK21- and CHIKV C6/36-infected cells. In parallel,
we also observed a downregulation of mx transcript in CHIKV BHK21-infected cells from 8 to 48
hpi. The infection with CHIKV-C6/36 led to a drastic decrease of mx at 8 hpi and then an increase
from 8 to 24- 48- hpi.


These data gave interesting results such as significant differences in the expression of the
apoptotic mx gene after infection of cells presenting a functional or dysfunctional antiviral RNAi
pathway and differences depending on viral particle composition. They will need to be repeated
to confirm these elements.
Indeed, it seems that infection of C6/36 induced an increase of mx transcript without cytopathic
effects (CPE) observable under the microscope (data not shown), which is intriguing. We could
not investigate the Aedes caspase activity in parallel due to lack of time and tools. In any case,
it seems that whether there was an RNAi innate immune response or not, the expression of the
p53 pro-apoptotic target gene was not accompanied by CPE. Was this response inhibited or is
it present at a low level, associated with the infection and necessary for the establishment of
chronicity in cells? Could the expression of p53 lead to the transcription of other target genes
that are not apoptotic during CHIKV infection? In order to investigate these questions, we
decided to focus on C6/36 infection with CHIKV produced either in BHK-21 or C6/36 cell lines.
The choice of using the C6/36 cell line initially was based on its permissiveness to CHIKV and
that it allowed studying the antiviral cellular response by overcoming the RNAi innate response.

              Time course of CHIKV infection in C6/36 cells and analysis of pro-apoptotic and
              antioxidant p53-target genes



The C6/36 cells were infected with CHIKV produced either in BHK21 or in C6/36, and the
supernatants were collected at different times post-infection to quantify the production of
infectious particles and the cells for RT-qPCR analysis (Figure 45 A, B, C and D). As before, we
observed a difference in viral replication between the C6/36 infected with CHIKV-BHK21 and
CHIKV-C6/36 (Figure 45 A.). From 2 hours, we detected more CHIKV-BHK21 viral RNA (log10 0.1)
than CHIKV-C6/36 (log10 0.01), suggesting that CHIKV resulting from BHK21 cells infected the
C6/36 cells more efficiently than CHIKV resulting from C6/36 cells. Then, from 6 to 12 hours, we
observed an increase in the replication rate for the two viruses with a higher detectable
quantity of CHIKV BHK-21.

In addition, the inoculum “Ino” (the viral inoculum is the start dilution with appropriate MOI
used to infect cells) of the viral titer (Figure 45 B.) shows that C6/36 cells were infected with the
same MOI (0.1) of CHIKV-BHK21 and CHIKV-C6/36. At 2 hours post-infection, no infectious
particles were detectable, indicating that the residual particles were eliminated. We observed
the same differences as qPCR analysis for virus production, with a higher quantity of viral
particles from cells infected with CHIKV-BHK-21 (105) than cells infected with CHIKV-C6/36
(4.103). Then, from 6 to 12 hours, the tendency was the same and after 12 hours the quantity
of viral particles was too high and the viral titration was saturated (data not shown).

Taken together, we could hypothesize that more CHIKV-BHK21 infectious particles infected the
C6/36 cells. Maybe the binding and entry of CHIKV-BHK21 was more efficient compared to the
binding of CHIKV-C6/36. Moreover, new infectious particles were produced 2 hours post-
infection, indicating that viral replication is faster than in mammalian cells. It seemed that the
differences in viral replication and production were the cause of very early events in the CHIKV
life cycle in the mosquito cell line.

CHIKV produced in BHK-21 (CHIKV-BHK21) and in C6/36 (CHIKV-C6/36) cells at MOI 0.1 and
collected for RT-qPCR analysis at 8, 24- and 48-hours post-infection and TCID50 at 2, 6, 8, and
12 hpi. The expression level of CHIKV nsp2 (vRNA=viral RNA), p53 and mx were measured by
RT-qPCR and normalized on housekeeping genes actin and rpl8 (A, C and D.). The production
of infectious particles in the supernatants of infected C6/36 was obtained by limiting dilution
assays in VeroE6 and the results were reported as log10-TCID50/ml (B.). Data are the mean ±
SD of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with an unpaired t-
test with a p-value <0.05.




Meanwhile, we wanted to know if this difference of infection had an impact on p53 and mx
mRNA expression (Figure 45 C. and D.). The level of regulation of p53 mRNA did not change
over time in infected cells compared to uninfected cells. At 8 and 12 hpi, we observed a non-
significant increase in p53 mRNA in cells infected with CHIKV BHK-21 and in parallel, the
increase of mx mRNA at 8 hpi (nonsignificant) and at 12 hpi (*,p<0.05). At 36 hpi, the level of
mx mRNA expression in infected cells was comparable to its expression in uninfected cells. The
infection of C6/36 with CHIKV produced in C6/36 did not induce regulations of p53 and mx
mRNA over time.

                                                                                           158


Given that p53 mRNA was not regulated, regulation could be isoform specific. We quantified
p53-1 and p53-2 mRNA plus two antioxidant enzymes, the catalase CAT and the superoxyde
dismutase SOD in C6/36 cells infected with CHIKV produced in BHK-21 cells (Figure 46). These
results indicate that no regulation of the four transcripts could be detected during CHIKV
infection.




Figure 46: p53 isoforms mRNA and antioxidant enzyme CAT and SOD mRNA expression
in the Aedes albopictus C6/36 cell line infected with CHIKV produced in the mammal BHK-
21 cell line. The mosquito C6/36 cell line was infected with CHIKV produced in BHK-21 cells at
MOI 0.1 and collected for RT-qPCR analysis at 8, 24- and 48-hours post-infection. The
expression levels of p53 isoforms (p53-1 and p53-2), mx, CAT and SOD were measured by RT-
qPCR and normalized against housekeeping genes actin and rpl8. Data are the mean ± SD of
three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with an unpaired t-test with
a p-value >0.05, nonsignificant.




Taken together, these results suggest that infection with CHIKV produced in a mammalian cell
would either infect more C6/36 cells or replicate more, compared to CHIKV produced in the
same C6/36 mosquito cell. Moreover, when C6/36 cells were infected with the same quantity
of viral particles, this difference in viral replication and production led to a significant increase

                                                                                                 159


in mx transcript at 12 hours post-infection in the cells infected with virus resulting from BHK1
cells. The expression of this transcript was not accompanied with observable cytopathic effects
(data not shown), suggesting that either a few portions of cells underwent cell death, or
apoptosis was not induced or perhaps inhibited by CHIKV. Moreover, these results suggest that
while viral replication was higher with CHIKV-BHK21 and induced higher expression of mx than
CHIKV-C6/36, mx induction was not correlated to a better antiviral response in the C6/36 cell
line. Thus, to go further it could be interesting to monitor the same experiment on U4.4 or Aag2
cells to compare the cellular response in a competent Dcr-2 cell line. Of course, another very
interesting experiment would be the infection of in vivo mosquitos by blood feeding with CHIKV
produced in mammalian or mosquito cells and analyze p53, mx transcripts and viral infections
on sections of the epithelial cells of the midgut at an early stage of infection.




             Conclusion


To sum up, we mainly focused on the p53-dependent apoptotic and antioxidant cellular
response of the Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells infected with CHIKV, produced either in
mammalian or mosquito cells. Our first objective was to explore the effect of CHIKV particles
produced in mammal and mosquito cells on cellular response, knowing that C6/36 was not
competent for the antiviral RNAi pathway. Thus, we observed a different cellular response from
C6/36 infected with either mammal or mosquito infectious particles. Indeed, the infection of
C6/36 with mammalian particles led to higher viral replication rate and higher production of
infectious particles, as well as the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic p53-target gene mx in the
late stage of infection. These results suggest that CHIKV of mammalian and mosquito origins
influences the viral replication and the cellular response. However, the induction of the pro-
apoptotic p53-target gene mx in the early stage of infection (with mammalian particles) did not
influence cell death as no cytopathic effects were observable during the infection of C6/36 cells.
We propose that following the detection of mammalian-CHIKV particles, CHIKV inhibits the
induction of cell death downstream of mx expression, explaining the absence of cell death with
the upregulation of mx.




                                                                                              160


We will further investigate the possible function of p53 and p53 isoforms in mosquito cell fate
during CHIKV infection. To this end, we will knockdown the expression of p53-1 and p53-2 using
silencing RNA and monitor the impact on viral infection, cell death and antioxidant response
using C6/36 (deficient for RNAi pathway) and U4.4 or Aag2 (efficient for RNAi pathway) cell
lines. In parallel, we will monitor the effect of AeIAP knockdown on viral infection. Indeed, if
cell death is controlled by CHIKV downstream p53-traget gene mx, we could investigate the
control of IAP during CHIKV infection.

CHAPTER 2) Analysis of the effect of p53 isoforms on CHIKV infection
  in mammalian cell lines


1 Objectives
The role of p53 isoforms during CHIKV infection has never been studied and after showing an
antiviral role of p53 we decided to go further by studying the possible isoform regulations and
decipher their function during the infection of LHCN-M2 with CHIKV. To do this, we decided to
study only the p53 N-terminal isoforms and more particularly ∆133p53α and the ∆40p53α. The
former because it is one of the most characterized isoforms and it has been suggested that
∆133p53α can act as a modulator of p53 in response to stress. Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that during the infection of two different pathogens, the bacteria Helicobacter
pylori and Influenza A virus, the ∆133p53 isoform could negatively impact the activity of p53.
The latter, ∆40p53α, has been little studied in infectiology although it has been shown to have,
among other functions, a dominant-negative effect on p53. For these reasons, it is interesting
to investigate their potential effect on CHIKV infection. Thus, we examined the regulation of
both isoforms during CHIKV infection of LHCN-M2 cells and then tried to decipher their function
by overexpression.

3724T) and anti-p53 CM1.

cells and supernatants using CellTiter-Glo® luminescence cell viability assay kit (Promega). Cells were
plated on 96-well plate day one at 10 000 cells/well in 100μl of LHCN-M2 medium. At several different
time points 100μl of cell titer was added on cells and ATP quantification was measured by luminescence
using a plate reader (Victor2 plate reader, Perkin Elmer).

                      Effect of ∆40p53 overexpression on CHIKV infection


Our first objective was to induce a complete knockout of p53 gene using CRISPR/Cas9
technology, thus we designed a single strand RNA (sgRNA) targeting the 5’ start of the gene to
induce a reading frame shift. Thus, we designed an oligo targeting the exon 2 of p53 gene not
far from the first ATG1 codon, named sgRNA_10_p53. The same strategy as for part one was
carried out, i.e. the transduction of two sgRNAs (sgRNA_400_p53 and sgRNA_402_p53) to
improve the efficiency of the technology. Figure 49 A. presents the position of the different
sgRNAs (10, 402 and 400) on the p53 gene.

After the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 cell lines, the profile of p53 was analyzed by Western blot
after treatment of the different cell lines with 0.8 μM of doxorubicin to detect the possible
accumulation of p53. Unexpectedly, LHCN-M2 transduced with pseudo-particles containing the
sgRNA_10, presented a huge over-expression of a 40 kDa protein detected with anti-p53 CM1
antibody (Figure 49 B.) and the anti-p53 DO-11 antibody (data not shown).
Moreover, following doxorubicin treatment of both the cell lines generated (sgRNA_p53_1 and
sgRNA_p53_2) the profile of the 40 kDa protein was different, i.e. in the first one expression
decreased drastically whereas in the second one expression was the same as in the untreated
cells. We hypothesized that this 40 kDa protein could correspond to the ∆40p53 isoform.
To test this hypothesis, we employed an RNA interference-related strategy using doxycycline-
inducible shRNA system targeting ∆40p53. The shRNA ∆40p53 were designed and kindly given
by Dr. Andrea Paradisi (Cancer Research Center of Lyon – CRCL). The LHCN-M2 sgRNA_luc and

                                                                                           167


sgRNA_p53_2 cell lines were transduced with shRNA-∆40p53 plasmid containing the
doxycycline-inducible system. Then, the cells were treated with 5 and 10 μg/ml of doxycycline
for 24 hours and 50μg of protein in cell lysates was used for Western blot analysis using anti-
p53 CM1 antibody (Figure 49 C.). We observed a reduction of the 40 kDa protein in LHCN-M2
sgRNA_p53_2 cell line after treatment with 10μg/ml of doxycycline. In parallel, we also
transfected the cells with siRNA against ∆40p53 and observed a decrease in the expression of
the 40 kDa protein (data not shown).
These results demonstrated that the 40 kDa protein over-expressed in the LHCN-M2
sgRNA_p53_2 cell line corresponded to the ∆40p53 isoform. In conclusion, we generated two
different full-length p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cell lines which overexpressed the ∆40p53 isoform
and responded differentially after DNA damage stress.


In the second step, we studied the impact of the endogenous overexpression of the ∆40p53
isoform on CHIKV infection. The LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53_1 and sgRNA_p53_2 cell lines were
infected with CHIKV-GFP at MOI 0.1 and then directly analyzed by flow cytometry detecting GFP
(Figure 50). Interestingly, we observed a significant decrease of CHIKV-GFP infection in both cell
lines compared to control sgRNA_luc and WT cells.




Figure 50: Effect of endogenous overexpression of ∆40p53 isoform on CHIKV infection in
LHCN-M2 cells. Cells were infected with CHIKV-GFP at MOI 0.1 for 24 hours and then fixed in
PFA 4% to detect the proportion of infected cells by flow cytometry analysis. Data are the mean
± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with an unpaired
Student t-test with a p-value <0.001.



                                                                                              168


Then, the expression of CHIKV capsid and p53 isoforms in LHCN-M2 wildtype, sgRNA_luc,
sgRNA_p53_1 and sgRNA_p53_2 cells lines was analyzed by Western blot 24 hours post-
infection. The Western blot presented in figure 51 is representative of what we observed in
three separate experiments.

We observed higher expression of viral capsid in LHCN-M2 WT cells than in sgRNA_luc cells for
the first experiment but in the two other experiments, the quantity of viral capsid was similar
in both cell lines. The CHIKV-infected sgRNA_p53 was used as a “positive control” of viral capsid
detection. Then, in the three independent experiments, we observed the same quantity of viral
capsid in the sgRNA_p53_1 cell line, and a strong reduction in the sgRNA_p53_2 cells, compared
to the sgRNA_luc cells. This result suggests that the endogenous expression of the ∆40p53
isoform negatively impacts the expression of viral capsid.




Interestingly, the detection of the ∆40p53 isoform showed that in the sgRNA_p53_1 and
sgRNA_p53_2 cell lines the quantity of the isoform decreased in the infected cells compared to
the mock cells. This result suggests that CHIKV infection induces a degradation of the ∆40p53
isoform.




Figure 51: Viral capsid, p53 and ∆40p53 isoform protein expression in LHCN-M2 cell
lysate after 24 hours of CHIKV infection. Cells were infected with CHIKV at MOI 0.1 for 24
hours. The cells were collected, and 50 μg of proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE for Western
blot assay. Viral capsid SFV-C antibody was used to detect CHIKV and anti-p53 CM1 to detect
the Δ40p53 isoform and other p53 isoforms. The antibody raised against housekeeping protein
β-actin was used as loading control.



                                                                                             169


Finally, another protein, of about 37 kDa was detected in sgRNA_p53 1 and 2 cell lines, and its
expression decreased at 24 hpi compared to the mock cells. We hypothesized that this protein
could be a ∆40p53 isoform, maybe a C-terminal isoform corresponding to ∆40p53β or ∆40p53γ
whose expression also decreased during CHIKV infection.

In conclusion, we showed that in p53 knockout, overexpressing ∆40p53 isoform cells, the
percentage of infected cells decreased compared to the sgRNA_luc control cell line and the viral
capsid decreased only in the sgRNA_p53_2 cell line. Moreover, the quantity of the ∆40p53
isoform decreased in infected sgRNA_p53_1 and sgRNA_p53_2. While the quantity of ∆40p53
was higher in the mock sgRNA_p53_1 cell line compared to the mock sgRNA_p53_2 cells, these
results suggest that the decrease in viral protein and the percentage of infected cells were not
dependent on ∆40p53 quantity. Finally, the reduction of viral capsid and ∆40p53 isoform in
infected sgRNA_p53_2 suggests an anti-viral effect of the isoform and a degradation of ∆40p53.




                      Change in cell morphology of the LHCN-M2 ∆40p53 cell line

Next, we wanted to investigate the role of the ∆40p53 isoform using the sgRNA_p53_2 cell line
as the expression of the viral capsid and the percentage of infected cells decreased compared
to control cell line sgRNA_luc. However, after dozens of passages in culture, the morphology of
the sgRNA_p53_2 cell line changed with a more rounded shape (Figure 52 A. left panel), but not
the sgRNA_p53_1 cell line. The sgRNA_p53_2 cell line seemed to have lost its skeletal muscle
phenotype. We hypothesized that CRISPR/Cas9 had generated an off target. To test this
hypothesis, we generated new cell lines sgRNA_p53 1 and 2: the first cell lines were named #1,
and the new cell lines #2 (Figure 52 A. right panel).


We again generated the LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 and sgRNA_p53_1 cell lines and validated the
p53 isoform expression by Western blot (Figure 52 B.). Moreover, we observed a decrease in
the ∆40p53 isoform in both cell lines, first generation (#1), and in the newly generated cell lines
(#2) we observed a higher quantity of the ∆40p53 isoform. In parallel, we detected a high
protein detection of the Cas9 two weeks after the generation of cell lines #2 and it was still
expressed after several months in the cell lines #1 (Figure 52 B.). The discrepancy in the

detection of ∆40p53 isoform could be due to the fact that the Cas9 nuclease participates in the
evolution of the cell lines generated by continuing to cut double strand DNA.


As the CRISPR/Cas9 LHCN-M2 cell lines were not clonal, we hypothesized that the cells without
overexpression of the ∆40p53 isoform would be selected against cells overexpressing the p53
isoform during successive passages in culture. Moreover, if we consider that the phenotype of
the sgRNA_p53_2 (#1) cells is linked to off-target(s), then we could hypothesize that the cells
presenting off-targets would be selected against the cells which over-expressed the ∆40p53
isoform, explaining why the expression decreased over time. Finally, off-target(s) could have
been at the origin of the decrease of CHIKV infection and the viral capsid. Therefore, we first
investigated the effect of the newly generated cell lines on cell viability and then on viral
infection.

LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53_2 #1 was significantly higher than the viability of control sgRNA_luc and
sgRNA_p53_2 #2 (Figure 53 B.). Moreover, a small proportion of infected sgRNA_p53_2 #1 cells
were still alive after 48 hours of infection while almost the entire sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53_2
#2 cell layer was destroyed by CHIKV (data not shown). However, we do not know if the
surviving cells were still infected.

obtained with two groups of three values. Statistical analysis was performed with a Student t-
test with a p-value <0.05.


Subsequently, the three different cell lines were infected with CHIKV-GFP (MOI 0.1, for 24
hours) and the LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53 cell line was used as control. The percentage of positive
CHIKV-GFP cells was higher in sgRNA_p53 cells and decreased in sgRNA_p53_2 #1 and #2 cells
compared to the sgRNA_luc cell line (Figure 54).

Taken together, these results indicated that the sgRNA_p53_2 #1 cell line which presented a
different morphology, was less infected by CHIKV and the infection did not affect its viability.
Thus, the effect on infection and cell viability seemed to be specific to this cell line. To test our
hypothesis, we generated CRISPR/Cas9 on another cell line, the human bone osteosarcoma
U2OS tumoral cell.

                       CRISPR/Cas9 U2OS cell line


U2OS cells are less relevant for the tropism of CHIKV than the LHCN-M2 cells, but they do not
present coding mutations in the p53 gene. p53 knockout U2OS cell lines were generated, and
we could observe the knockout of p53 in three U2OS cells and the overexpression of ∆40p53 in
U2OS sgRNA_p53 1 and 2, using anti-p53 CM1 antibody (Figure 55 A.). Using the DO-1 antibody,
we detected a low quantity of p53 in sgRNA_p53 and sgRNA_p53_1, suggesting the incomplete
depletion of p53. Moreover, these results suggested that the over-expression of endogenous
∆40p53 was reproducible in another cell line, using the single guide RNA 10 (sgRNA_10_p53).


Then, p53 knockout U2OS cell lines were infected with CHIKV-GFP at MOI 0.1 for 24 hours and
the percentage of infected cells was investigated by flow cytometry (Figure 55 B.). The three
U2OS cell lines were more infected compared to the U2OS sgRNA_luc cells. Thus, the
endogenous overexpression of the ∆40p53 isoform was not correlated with a decrease in
infection of U2OS; indeed, the opposite effect was obtained. This could have been related to
the cell type (U2OS versus LHCN-M2. To go further into this analysis, it would be necessary to
repeat the infection of cells using a CHIKV-GFP strain and a wildtype CHIKV strain.

In conclusion, it seems that only the LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53_2 #1 induced an inhibition in CHIKV
infection without impairing cell viability. Nevertheless, we confirmed a decrease in the
percentage of infected cells in the new generated LHCN-M2 cell line (sgRNA_p53_2 #2), with
the same guides 10 and 402. However, the involvement of the ∆40p53 isoform is not clear.
Indeed, regarding the cellular morphology in the LHCN cell line and the contradictory results
with the repetitive generated U2OS cell lines, it seemed that the effect of ∆40p53 isoform would
be cell type specific.

Another strategy was employed to investigate the possible effect of ∆40p53 isoform on CHIKV
infection by its overexpression in p53 knockout cells. Moreover, the potential effect of the
∆133p53 isoform was also investigated. In this way we could investigate the effect of the
isoform alone or in association with full length p53. The overexpression of ∆40p53α and
∆133p53α isoforms, generated as presented in materials and methods, were confirmed by
Western blot analysis with antibodies against p53 CM1 and anti-HA, as the proteins are tagged
in the N-terminal region (Figure 56). Using anti HA antibody, we observed that the three
transduced LHCN-M2 cells overexpressed the ∆40p53α isoform and ∆133p53α isoform
correctly and equivalently (Figure 56, top panel: HA).

In parallel, using anti p53 CM1 antibody, the detection of ∆40p53α was much lower than that
obtained before with anti-HA while it was the contrary for the ∆133p53α isoform (Figure 56,
bottom panel: CM1). Moreover, it seemed that the ∆133p53β or ∆133p53γ C-terminal isoform
was recognized by the CM1 antibody, suggesting their expression followed the overexpression
of the ∆133p53α isoform using doxycycline-inducible system.


                      Effect of overexpression of p53 isoforms on CHIKV viral capsid


LHCN-M2 WT, sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53/∆40p53α cells were treated with 2μg/ml of
doxycycline for 24 hours and then infected with CHIKV at MOI 0.1 for 24 hours (Figure 57 A.).
The schematic workflow of this experiment (condition 1) is presented below. Regarding the
expression of the ∆40p53α isoform in uninfected cells, for the three cell lines, we observed
significant induced expression of the isoform with the anti-HA antibody and less expression with
the anti-p53 CM1 antibody. Curiously, at 24 hpi we were not able to detect the inducible
expression of the ∆40p53α isoform, and detected very few in sgRNA_luc and sgRNA_p53/∆40
using anti-HA and anti-p53 CM1 antibodies. Finally, regarding the expression of the viral capsid
in both conditions (with and without doxycycline) we did not observe a difference of expression.
We also investigated the percentage of infected cells by flow cytometry and did not observe a
reduction in CHIKV infection (data not shown).

Given that the Old-World alphavirus nsP2 protein induces rapid degradation of the subunit of
RNA polymerase II, Rpb1, and that the ∆40p53α isoform is under the control of polymerase II,
we hypothesized that CHIKV nsP2 induces the transcriptional shut-off of ∆40p53α. In order to
compensate the possible effect of nsP2 on cell transcription we treated cells with doxycycline
several times: the schematic workflow of this experiment (condition 2) is presented below. We
observed a detectable expression of ∆40p53α isoform 24 hpi with the anti-HA antibody;
however, it was still lower than the expression detected in mock cells (Figure 57 B.).
Interestingly, we detected a small reduction in viral capsid expression in infected
sgRNA_p53/∆40 with doxycycline compared to infected sgRNA_p53/∆40 without doxycycline.
On the contrary, we detected more viral capsid in WT/∆40 and sgRNA_luc/∆40 infected cells
with doxycycline, compared to WT/∆40 and sgRNA_luc/∆40 infected cells without doxycycline.


                                                                                            177


This last result suggested that the expression of p53 and ∆40p53 together could be correlated
to an increase in viral capsid expression. The experiment should be repeated to confirm this
result.


To conclude, the expression of p53 and ∆40p53α isoform seemed to be correlated with an
increase in the quantity of CHIKV viral capsid, while in the absence of p53, the overexpression
of ∆40p53α isoform was correlated to a decrease in the quantity of CHIKV viral capsid. The
doxycycline-system must be improved to overexpress the ∆40p53 isoform during viral infection
and the percentage of infection and the production of infectious particles must be determined.

The role of ∆133p53α isoform has been explored in the context of Influenza A virus and it has
been shown that ∆133p53α and p53 β can act as regulators of viral production (Terrier et al.
2012). In the context of alphaviruses infections, the potential function of physiological p53
isoforms has never been explored. We investigated the effect of ∆133p53α isoform
overexpression in p53 wildtype and p53 knockout LHCN-M2 cells on CHIKV infection.

As previously, we generated a doxycycline inducible-system overexpressing ∆133p53α isoform
protein. We observed the overexpression of ∆133p53α isoform in non-infected and doxycycline
induced cells but not in infected and doxycycline induced cells (Figure 58). In parallel, the
quantity of the viral capsid was not different between these two conditions. The experiment
was performed only once so it should be repeated, and the percentage of infected cells must
be determined. To conclude, unfortunately, this assay did not identify a potential function of
∆133p53 isoform in the context of CHIKV infection and other approaches might be applied for
the overexpression of ∆133p53 and ∆40p53 such as non-inducible cells.

             Discussion


In the past few years, very few studies have investigated the role of p53 isoforms in the context
of non-oncogenic viral infection. In addition, the direct effect of the p53 and p53 isoforms on
the viral cycle has been demonstrated (Aloni-Grinstein et al. 2018; Austin et al. 2012; Terrier et
al. 2012). These studies revealed the importance of p53 and p53 isoforms during viral infection,
suggesting an effect for many viruses belonging to different families. Indeed, the modulation of
host p53 pathways allows controlling various cellular antiviral responses such as apoptosis,
immune response, or ROS production.
Our approach to studying a potential function of ∆40p53α and ∆133p53α isoforms in the human
LHCN-M2 muscle cell line infected with CHIKV encountered technical difficulties and other
difficulties which seem to be linked to the virus replication cycle.


We observed that in the CHIKV-infected CRISPR/Cas9 cell line sgRNA_p53_2 #1, the
overexpression of ∆40p53 isoform was correlated to a decrease in the percentage of infected
cells with less viral capsid. In parallel, with the sgRNA_p53_1 cell line the same decrease in
percentage of infected cells was detected, while the quantity of viral capsid was similar to that
observed in control sgRNA_luc cell line. The sgRNA_p53_1 cell line was generated using single
guides 10 and 400 and the sgRNA_p53_2 cell line using single guides 10 and 402. The single
guide RNA 10 seemed to be responsible of the endogenous overexpression of the ∆40p53
isoform. The single guide 10 could have inserted a mutation in the region of the first ATG1
coding p53 without damage to the frameshift in the second ATG40 sequence coding ∆40p53.
Consequently, the ribosome complex could not recognize ATG1, inducing a more significant
ribosome entry in ATG40, and an exaggeration of the translation of ∆40p53.
In addition, as the ∆40p53 did not contain N-terminal residues of the transcriptional activation
domain TAD1 or the amino-acid motif that binds MDM2, this isoform escaped MDM2-mediated
degradation and thus was more stable than full length p53. This might explain the amount of
isoform expressed after the generation of the CRISPR/Cas9 cell lines. Nevertheless, during the
experiment, this endogenous expression in LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53_2 #1 cell line drastically
decreased, and the cellular morphology changed. The percentage of infected cells was still
lower than in control cell line. We wonder if it was the effect of ∆40p53 overexpression in this



                                                                                              181


particular cell line that induced the change of cellular morphology and subsequently the level
of expression of ∆40p53 protein, or was it the effect of the CRISPR/Cas9 method?
We showed that the Cas9 nuclease inducing the double strand DNA break was still expressed
some weeks after the generation of the cell lines and even after months to a lesser extent.
Moreover, as Cas9 nuclease and single guide RNA are integrated in the genome and
constitutively active, this might affect cell fitness and specific sgRNA could target nonspecific
gene generating off-targets. It is possible that the sgRNA_p53_2 #1 cell line suffered from off-
target(s) which might explain the effect observed on cellular morphology and on CHIKV
infection. As this cell line is not clonal, there are perhaps several populations and two of them
could present the endogenous overexpression of ∆40p53 isoform on the one hand, and an
unknown off target inducing the change of cell morphology on the other. We hypothesized that
the second cellular population had been selected against the cellular population overexpressing
the ∆40p53 isoform.
However, the infection of new generated cell line LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53_2 #2 presented a
similar decrease in the percentage of infected cells, whilethe infection of U2OS sgRNA_p53_2
led to an increase in the percentage of infected cells.
Even more strikingly, the viability of the LHCN-M2 sgRNA_p53_2 #1 cell line was not affected
by infection and we detected infectious particles in the supernatants of the cells one week after
infection (data not shown). This might signify that this particular cell line could be “persistently”
infected with CHIKV. To test this hypothesis, infection with CHIKV could be challenged a second
time to know if the survival cells can be infected without again impacting cell viability.
After challenges, the surviving cells could be isolated by serial dilution in a multi-well plate to
ideally obtain one single clone in each well and infect them again to confirm the effect on the
viral infection of every single clone. This experiment would allow sequencing and identifying
mutations that confer the phenotype of the cells and/or the effect on CHIKV infection compared
with the wildtype cell line. Moreover, the cellular transcriptome of survival cells could be
analyzed by RNA sequencing.


To conclude, with this first approach, we do not know with any certainty if the ∆40p53 isoform
impacted the infection of the human muscle cell line LHCN-M2 by chikungunya virus. Another
approach was taken based on an inducible system overexpressing the p53 isoform.



                                                                                                 182


After several repetitions we showed that the overexpression of ∆40p53α disappeared 24 hours
post-infection and one experiment carried out on ∆133p53α gave the same result. We
suggested that after the expression of CHIKV nsP2 protein, the degradation of subunit Rpb1 of
RNA polymerase II induced the reduction in the expression of the ∆40p53α and ∆133p53α
isoforms. Indeed, the doxycycline-inducible system of the plasmid is controlled by RNA
polymerase II. We could generate the same plasmid under the control of RNA polymerase III.
We showed that the 5S rRNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III presented the same cycle
quantification value in LHCN-M2 cells infected with CHIKV overtime compared to mock cells,
whereas gusb, rpl22 and rpl27 transcribed by RNA polymerase II, presented a difference of four
cycles between 8 and 24 hours post-infection compared to mock cells.
However, the several treatments of LHCN-M2 cell lines with doxycycline allowed detecting a
higher quantity of the ∆40p53α isoform in three cell lines and it was correlated with a slight
decrease in the detection of the viral capsid. We assume that the expression of ∆40p53α had
an effect on the viral capsid. It would be interesting to investigate the percentage of infection
and the production of infectious particles to confirm the results obtained previously in the
CRISPR-mediated endogenous overexpressing ∆40p53 cell line.
Among the studies performed to assess the function of ∆40p53, it has been determined that in
HCT116 and H1299 cells, which express exogenous ∆40p53 but not p53, ∆40p53 may inhibit
starvation-induced autophagy. This inhibition arises from the degradation of dsRNA via the 3’-
5’ exonuclease activity of ∆40p53 which could inhibit PKR/eIF2α-induced autophagy (Zang et al.
2017). Thus, taken together we can hypothesise that the overexpression of ∆40p53 isoform in
the absence of p53 in LHCN-M2 cells inhibited pro-viral autophagy during CHIKV infection,
leading to the impairment of viral capsid expression, and the decrease in the percentage of
infected cells. To test this hypothesis, it could be interesting to analyze the autophagic flux
engaged in LHCN-M2 cells overexpressing the ∆40p53 isoform and compare it with that of the
LHCN-M2 p53 wildtype cells expressing or not the ∆40p53 isoform.


In LHCN-M2 expressing p53 and ∆40p53, we observed a higher expression of viral capsid
compared to infected cells expressing only p53. This preliminary result shows that the
expression of p53 and ∆40p53 is correlated to an increase in capsid detection and maybe to the
effect of ∆40p53 on p53, controlling the antiviral activity of p53 through the Type-I interferon

signaling pathway. The experiment was conducted once, so it must be repeated and the
percentage of infected cells analyzed.


In U2OS, the endogenous overexpression of ∆40p53 did not lead to a decrease in CHIKV
infection. It is possible that the function of the p53 isoform is different depending on the cell
type. Further studies are needed to improve the molecular and cellular tools to decipher the
potential function of ∆40p53 in CHIKV infection. The generation of an inducible system
dependent on the RNA polymerase III could be a solution, or a stable cell line that constantly
overexpresses ∆40p53. We could also use another permissive cell line, less relevant for CHIKV
tropism, but studied in-depth for p53 and p53 isoform expression, such as HCT116.


The investigation concerning the other isoform of interest, ∆133p53 did not give results on
CHIKV capsid expression. The cellular expression of the ∆133p53 isoform protein was not
detectable by Western blot using anti-p53 CM1 antibody which potentially recognizes the
twelve human p53 isoforms. The overexpression of the ∆133p53 isoform protein in LHCN-M2
wildtype and p53 knockout seems to be related to the same problem encountered with the
∆40p53 isoform, i.e. a complete transcriptional shut-off of its expression.




In conclusion, we assume that following p53-dependent antiviral activity on CHIKV-infected
LHCN-M2, the intertwining of p53 with p53 isoforms leads to a positive or negative regulator of
p53 activity.

    GENERAL CONCLUSION

Alphaviruses are mainly transmitted to humans by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus, typically
Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. The chikungunya virus has recently spread from Asia and
Africa to the continents of Europe and America, making it a worldwide threat and one of the
most common arboviruses infecting humans. While in humans, chikungunya virus disease is
characterized by fever, headache, and a typical acute infection sometimes followed by
persistent arthralgia or myalgia, in mosquito the infection does not seem to cause significant
pathology. At the cellular level, the infection of several mammalian cells with chikungunya virus
inevitably leads to the death of the cell layer, whereas the infection of mosquito cells leads to
the chronicity of cell layer without perceptible cytopathic effects. To date, no vaccine or specific
treatments for humans have been developed and the control of mosquito populations requires
more research to be confident about its effectiveness. This highlights the importance of
continuing research on chikungunya virus biology and cellular response in mammals and
mosquitoes, in order to develop in the future adapted antiviral treatments and vaccines for
humans, and control the permissiveness of mosquitoes.

Thus, one objective of my project was to study the potential role of p53 on the cellular outcome
and viral infection in mammals and insects infected with Alphavirus, mainly chikungunya virus
and to a lesser extent Sindbis virus.

Firstly, we showed that the infection of a human immortalized skeletal muscle cell line with
chikungunya virus led to the stabilization of p53. In order to investigate the potential function
of p53 we generated a p53 depleted cell line and showed that in the absence of p53 expression,
the cells were not able to produce Type-I interferon (IFNβ) and could not engage the Type-I
signaling pathway (Mx1, IFIT1). The p53 knockout led to an increase in the percentage of
infected cells, highlighting the antiviral effect of p53. In parallel, given that p53 is also involved
in antiviral apoptotic response for other arboviruses, we investigated the apoptotic p53 target
genes such as p21, puma and bax. Surprisingly, no regulations of all genes were observed,
suggesting an antiviral role of p53 involving innate immune response activity, independently of
its antiviral apoptotic function during chikungunya virus infection. The antiviral activity of p53
could be correlated to the pathogenicity of infection and chronicity. Indeed, the activity level of
p53 can be dependent on the patient and in the case of a “natural” p53 activation, the infection

                                                                                                  186


can be rapidly eliminated. In the case of a inefficient p53 activation, the viral infection can
persist and become chronic.
In addition to p53, twelve identified p53 isoforms were physiologically transcribed and we
investigated the potential function of two of them: ∆40p53 and ∆133p53. Our results showed
that infection with chikungunya virus decreased in a genetically modified human skeletal
muscle cell line overexpressing ∆40p53. Figure 59 shows schematically the antiviral function of
p53 stabilization in a human skeletal muscle cell line infected with chikungunya virus.


The comparative effect of p53 on chikungunya virus infection in insects was investigated using
the in vivo Drosophila melanogaster fly. Thanks to our collaboration with Pr. Mollereau, the
Drosophila melanogaster p53-/- mutant strain was challenged with Sindbis and chikungunya
virus. Interestingly, the effect we observed on viral infection was the opposite of that found in
the human cell line, i.e. p53-/- flies were less infected than control w1118 strain. However, the
survival of p53-/- mutants injected with chikungunya virus was also impacted but we
hypothesized that in flies, p53 could present pro-viral controlling virus-induced oxidative stress.
In order to support this hypothesis, it would be necessary to inject specific p53 depleted mutant
strains (Dmp53 +/+ and ∆Np53, and inversely) with chikungunya virus and Sindbis virus. Figure
60 represents schematically the impact of p53 isoforms on Sindbis virus and chikungunya virus.


Concerning the mosquito cell line, we observed that in the CHIKV-infected C6/36 cell line (non-
competent for antiviral RNAi pathway), the apoptotic p53-target gene mx was upregulated
without observable cytopathic effects. We hypothesized that CHIKV may control the induction
of cell death downstream of Michelob_mx induction in mosquito cells and further
investigations are needed.
After the detection of viral RNA and/or viral proteins, it is likely that p53 in insects included
innate immune signaling to respond to stress induced by infection. In permissive mosquitoes,
the control of virus-induced stress through the p53 and p53 isoform signal transduction
pathway could have been selected by arboviruses during evolution.
