                                       Résumé


     Les leucémies sont une famille des cancers issus de la prolifération maligne des
cellules hématopoïétiques. La leucémie myéloïde aigue (AML) représente 30% des
leucémies chez les adultes et menace surtout les personnes âgées de 64 ans et plus.
Actuellement, la chimiothérapie est la méthode principale de prise en charge de l’AML,
mais celle-ci comporte des effets secondaires importants ainsi qu’un risque de récidive
qui freinent son développement. Le redéploiement des molécules déjà utilisées pour
d’autres maladies est une stratégie émergente dans le traitement du cancer. Par exemple,
la chlorpromazine (CPZ), une molécule à activité antipsychotique, démontre une
activité contre les lignes cellulaires issues d’AML, mais son activité au niveau du
système nerveux central entraine des effets indésirables.
     Compte tenu de l’activité de CPZ contre les cellules leucémiques, nous avons mis
au point un système de vectorisation de médicaments original pour le traitement d’AML.
La CPZ est d’abord incluse dans une cyclodextrine (CD, molécule cage à base de
glucose) et ensuite ce complexe est encapsulé dans des liposomes (vésicules à contenu
aqueux délimitées par une ou plusieurs bicouches phospholipidiques). Ce système de
“drug-in-CD-in-liposomes” (DCL) est conçu pour circuler longtemps dans le sang
après injection intraveineuse mais ne peut pas traverser la barrière hémato-encéphalique
(BHE).
     Il a été nécessaire d’optimiser la formulation avec ses trois composants principaux :
CPZ, CD et phospholipides. Ainsi, une évaluation physico-chimique approfondie a été
entreprise dans l’objectif de mieux appréhender les interactions entre les différents
partenaires, notamment pour les couples CD/CPZ, CD/lipides et CPZ/lipides. La
calorimétrie de titration isotherme (ITC) a permis de déterminer la stœchiométrie et la
constante d’association pour les complexes d’inclusion CD/CPZ. Des stœchiométries
1:1, 1:2 ou 1:1+1:2 ont été déterminées pour les complexes CD/CPZ. Le complexe
formé avec la sugammadex (SGM), une cyclodextrine de type gamma substituée,
présente uniquement une stœchiométrie de type 1:2. De plus, les associations les plus

                                           1


importantes vis-à-vis de la CPZ sont obtenues en présence de sugammadex ou de la
sulfobutyléther-β-CD     (SBE-β-CD).      Par    ailleurs,   la   spectroscopie    RMN
bidimensionnelle et plus particulièrement les expériences de type ROESY ont permis
de déterminer la structure des complexes d’inclusion entre les CDs et la molécule de
CPZ en conjugaison avec des simulations de dynamique moléculaire.
     La CPZ est une molécule photosensible, surtout sous lumière UV-C et la
photodégradation suit une cinétique de premier ordre au début de la réaction.
L’inclusion de la CPZ dans les CDs accélère légèrement la photodégradation, d’un
degré qui dépend de la CD. Il est à noter que la plus grande accélération est observée
en présence de SGM.
     Avant de formuler les liposomes, nous avons étudier les interactions entre les CDs
et les lipides. Dans une première étape, des liposomes multilamellaires (MLVs)
préparés à partir de palmitoylstearoylphosphatidylcholine (PSPC) ont été utilisés et les
interactions avec les différentes CDs ont été étudiées par calorimétrie différentielle à
balayage (DSC) ainsi que par diffraction des rayons X aux petits et grands angles
(SAXS/WAXS). Les résultats de DSC démontrent que la majorité des CDs
n’influencent pas les transitions de phase du phospholipide, et seules des concentrations
supérieures à 25 mM de sulfobutyléther-éthyle-β-CD (SBE-Et-β-CD) perturbent
fortement la bicouche phospholipidique. Les analyses par diffraction de rayons X
confirment les résultats obtenus par DSC. Toutefois, une augmentation de l’épaisseur
des bicouches a été observée pour des fortes concentrations en CDs ioniques et pour
des températures élevées. Par contre, aucune influence sur l’organisation des chaînes
latérales n’a été observée, indiquant que l’interaction des CDs se faisait avec les têtes
polaires.
     Pour confirmer ces résultats dans des conditions plus proches de celles de
l’évaluation biologique, des liposomes unilamellaires (SUV) ont étés formulés à partir
d’un phospholipide d’origine naturelle, la phosphatidylcholine d’œuf hydrogénée
(HEPC), avec une petite proportion d’un phospholipide porteur de poly(ethylène glycol)
(DSPE-PEG2000) pour assurer leur rémanence vasculaire, en présence ou non de

                                           2


cholestérol, le rôle du cholestérol étant de les stabiliser davantage. Des études de suivie
de la turbidité pendant l’ajout progressive de CD ont démontré que les liposomes SUV
ne sont pas perturbés par la plupart des CD, que ce soit en présence ou non de
cholestérol. Seulement, la SBE-Et-β-CD a provoqué un effet délétère sur les liposomes,
surtout en absence de cholestérol.
     Suite aux études physico-chimiques, trois cyclodextrines ont été retenues pour la
formulation des DCL et les études biologiques : la sugammadex (SGM), la
sulfobutyléther-β-CD (SBE-β-CD) et la 2-hydroxypropyle--CD (HP-γ-CD). Les deux
premières CDs démontraient des très fortes associations avec la CPZ, alors que l’HP-
γ-CD a montré la plus faible association vis-à-vis de la CPZ mais est connue pour sa
faible toxicité in vivo.
     La méthode « dehydration-rehydration vesicles » (DRV) a été choisie pour la
formulation de DCL car cette méthode est connue pour fournir des taux d’encapsulation
élevés des molécules hydrophiles de haut poids moléculaire. Or, les premiers essais
produisaient des liposomes d’une taille trop importante pour une administration
intraveineuse (IV). L’addition d’une étape supplémentaire d’extrusion à permis d’en
réduire la taille, mais le pourcentage de CPZ encapsulée (EE) s’avérait faible (environ
10%). Ainsi la méthode DRV combinée à l’utilisation d’un gradient de concentration
de sulfate d’ammonium, afin de « piéger » la CPZ dans les liposomes sous forme
insoluble, a été utilisée. Ce protocole optimisé a permis d’augmenter l’EE en CPZ à
environ 30% en absence de CD et à 15-18% en présence de CD tout en gardant une
taille compatible avec l’administration IV.
     La cytotoxicité de ces formulations a été évaluée sur 4 lignées cellules humaines
leucémiques (HL-60 - une lignée de leucémie promyélocytique et MOLM13, MV4-11
and OCI-AML issues d’AML). Pour comparaison, une lignée normale de cellules de
rein de rat (NRK) a également été utilisée. Le critère d’évaluation était la réduction des
composés à base de tétrazolium (MTS ou WST-1) par les enzymes mitochondriales.
     Sur les lignées leucémiques, les liposomes contenant de la CPZ ont tous démontré
un effet cytotoxique tandis que les liposomes vides avaient tendance à stimuler la

croissance et les CD seules étaient sans effet. Pourtant, l’activité des liposomes
comportant les complexes d’inclusion CD/CPZ (DCL) était moins importante que celle
des liposomes chargés en CPZ, dans l’ordre DCL-SGM/CPZ < DCL-SBE-β-CD/CPZ
< DCL-HP-γ-CD/CPZ. L’activité était inversement proportionnelle à la constante
d’affinité entre la CD et la CPZ, suggérant une libération retardée. Cette hypothèse a
été confortée par le fait que l’activité des DCL à base de complexes d’inclusion
CD/CPZ était plus importante après une exposition de 72h qu’après 24h. En effet, les
DCL-SGM/CPZ ne démontrent pas d’activité après des temps d’incubation courts, mais
une activité a été révélée après 72h.
     Afin d’étudier la capture des DCL par les cellules, les liposomes ont été rendus
fluorescents par l’insertion d’une petite proportion d’un phospholipide porteur de
rhodamine (18:1 Liss Rhod PE). La préparation de liposomes fluorescents a permis une
évaluation de leur association avec les cellules MOLM13 par cytométrie de flux.
Toutefois, la CPZ conduit à atténuer la fluorescence de la rhodamine, ce qui a rendu
l’interprétation des résultats difficile.
     Par ailleurs, la cytotoxicité des formulations de CPZ vis-à-vis des cellules NRK
était moins importante que celle observée avec les cellules leucémiques à 24h mais était
majorée à 72h. Une expérience dans laquelle les cellules NRK ont été mises en contact
avec les formulations pendant 24h, puis en milieu frais pendant 48h de plus
démontraient une activité similaire à celle de l’incubation de 24h. L’ensemble de ces
résultats sont prometteurs pour la mise au point de systèmes à libération contrôlée de
CPZ pour le traitement d’AML, sans toxicité pour les tissus normaux.

                                    Introduction

     Leukemia is a group of cancers caused by the uncontrollable proliferation of
progenitor cells in the bone marrow (BM). Accounting for 30% of all leukemias in
adults, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is especially a threat for older people with a
median age of 64 years old. Presently, chemotherapy, the standard “7+3 regimen” for
example, is the main therapeutic strategy for AML, but severe side-effects and
possibility of relapse have hampered its development.
     Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a typical antipsychotic, has attracted attention since it was
reported to show cytotoxic activity towards human promyelocytic leukemic
granulocytes (HL-60) (Hait et al. 1985). To the best of our knowledge, no published
work refers to the AML-treating properties of CPZ. Therefore, it is a new strategy and
only limited information could be obtained from the literature, making it necessary to
perform fundamental investigations on the feasibility of using CPZ for AML treatment.
     To repurpose CPZ as a novel therapeutic strategy for AML, the first problem to be
overcome is its passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), an essential property
for an antipsychotic but undesirable in other applications. Considering the ‘solid’
capillary walls formed by polarized endothelial cells in BBB, liposomes would be
suitable drug carrier, because they could be excluded from the central nervous system
due to their larger diameter. Furthermore, polyethylene glycol (PEG), a hydrophilic
polymer, will be grafted to the surface of liposomes to reduce their recognition by serum
components and render them “stealth” in the blood stream (Klibanov et al. 1990). The
long-circulating property of PEGylated liposomes can significantly alter the
pharmacokinetics of the formulation after intravenous administration.
     However, an important fact is that CPZ is an amphiphilic molecule, which may
lead to drug leakage or even destruction of the nanocarriers in the harsh physiological
environment of circulating system. Therefore, cyclodextrins (CDs), a group of
cyclic oligosaccharides, were considered. Due to the hydrophilic outer rim and
hydrophobic internal cavity, CDs can entrap various hydrophobic or amphiphilic
molecules to form inclusion complexes, leading to the alteration of guest molecule’s
                                           5


physicochemical behavior. In our case, the affinity of CPZ for lipids could be weakened
by association with CDs, and hypothetically, drug leakage would be avoided.
     Therefore, a versatile drug delivery strategy, the drug-in-CDs-in-liposomes (DCL)
system was envisaged. This concept was first reported by McCormack and Gregoriadis,
by encapsulating the CD/drug inclusion complexes within liposomes (McCormack and
Gregoriadis 1994). Based on the potential of CPZ in AML treatment, we designed a
similar DCL system, which involves 3 interrelated ingredients: CPZ, CDs, and
phospholipids. To get a better insight into the properties of the liposomal formulation
and select the most appropriate CD candidate for the DCL system, we performed
comprehensive investigations on the interactions between CD/CPZ, CD/lipid and
CPZ/lipid.
     This thesis is divided into 4 chapters.
     Chapter 1 details the current status and the possibility of repurposing CPZ in
AML treatment. It also addresses the development of liposomes and the role of CDs in
DCL system.
     Chapter 2 focuses on interaction between CD/CPZ. It describes the formation and
spatial structure of the CD/CPZ inclusion complexes, and the photodegradation of CPZ
in presence of CDs.
     Chapter 3 concentrates on the interaction between CD/lipid and CPZ/lipid. It
reports the impact of CDs on the phase transition, lamellar distance and hydrocarbon
chain packing of phospholipids, the destructing effect of CDs on liposomes, and the
optimal CPZ concentration to prepare the liposomal formulation.
     Chapter 4 is dedicated to the preparation of the liposomal formulation, the
cytotoxic evaluation of the formulation and its ingredients against leukemia cell lines,
and the cellular uptake of the formulation by AML cells.

1.1. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

1.1.1. Leukemia


     Leukemia is a group of cancers caused by malignant clonal proliferation of
hematopoietic stem cells. The uncontrollable expansion and growth of progenitor cells
in the bone marrow (BM) leads to a reduction of normal hemopoiesis and an
accumulation of immature leukemic cells that spread to other organs of the body, such
as liver, spleen and lymph nodes (Fig. 1). Therefore, various severe consequences
follow, the most common of which are haemorrhage, anemia and secondary infections.
These complications increase the risk of death so the mortality associated with leukemia
cannot be ignored. According to a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease,
leukemia was present in 2.4 million people and led to 518,500 deaths throughout the
world in 2017, with increase of 25.1% compared with 2007 (James et al. 2018).

     Generally, leukemia can be classified as acute and chronic according to disease
onset and course, and myeloid and lymphocytic based on differentiation (Kohlschütter
et al. 2008). Compared with chronic leukemia, acute leukemia has a much shorter
                                                8


disease course and may deteriorate or even cause life-threatening consequences within
a few weeks without therapy.
     Accounting for 30% of all leukemias in adults, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is
an especial threat for older people with a median age of 64 years for presentation
(Bordoni and Zucca 2007). According to an investigation from the UK, AML mortality
is closely related to age (Fig. 2). The age-specific mortality rate shows a clear increase
for people older than 60 years and reaches the highest point in the 85-89 age group, for
both males and females.

1.1.2. Classification of AML


     Careful diagnosis of AML is essential to ensure better treatment. For instance,
"preleukemic" cases, different from AML, should be given distinct treatment. Therefore,
a comprehensive classification of AML is both necessary and clinically useful.
     The first classification system for AML was called “French-American-British”
strategy, which divided AML into 8 subtypes (M0 to M7). The World Health
                                               9


    Organization (WHO) produced a new classification in 2008 and an updated version in
    2016, based on cytogenetic alterations and genetic abnormalities (Table 1).

1.1.3. Treatment of AML


1.1.3.1. Classical drugs


     The chemotherapeutic strategy for AML treatment has been based on a
combination of two classical cytostatic drugs: anthracyclines and cytarabine (Fig. 3).
     Anthracyclines are a class of anticancer drugs that were first extracted from
Streptomyces bacterium in 1960s (Fujiwara et al. 2008). These antibiotics consist of a
tetracycline ring with a sugar moiety connected via a glycosidic bond. Based on their
particular chemical structure, these drugs intercalate with DNA when they have been
taken up by cells and induce breakage of the DNA double-strand. During the past
decades, numerous anthracyclines have been developed and one of these, daunorubicin
(DNR) (Fig. 3), has become the most commonly used agent for AML treatment.
Nevertheless, the cardiotoxic side effects of current anthracyclines have stimulated the
interest in the development of novel related analogs.
     Cytarabine (Ara-C) (Fig. 3), also known as cytosine arabinoside, is a cell-phase-
specific cytotoxic drug widely used in chemotherapy for treatment of leukemia,
including AML (Murphy and Yee 2017). It was first synthesized in 1959 and approved
by FDA in 1969. Cytarabine is a nucleoside analog and when it has entered the cell, it
incorporated into DNA and impedes its replication. Due to the cell-phase specificity,
cytarabine exerts its effects mainly on cells undergoing rapid DNA synthesis such as
cancer cells. It is intravenously administered and high doses are required to offset the
drawback of its short half-life (Phillips et al. 1991).

1.1.3.2. Standard chemotherapy


     The common clinical chemotherapy used in AML is the so-called ’7+3 regimen’,
which consists of a continuous infusion of cytarabine (100-200 mg/m2) for 7 days with
daunorubicin (60-90 mg/m2) or idarubicin (12 mg/m2) infusion on the first 3 days (Briot
et al. 2018). This induction therapy remains largely as it was at its first clinical
application in 1970s, despite a variety of schemes that were designed and assessed in
the following years, such as changing the dose of the two components or adding extra
agents. Benefiting from this strategy, 60-80% of younger patients can achieve a
complete remission, while the percentage for older patients is 45-65% (Desroches and
Rosenbaum 2010; Short et al. 2018).
     However, chemotherapy always carries the risk of side effects. For example,
anthracyclines can lead to damage to the heart, especially in long-term treatment.
Coordination problems may be caused by high doses of cytarabine because of its effects
on the brain of patients. Moreover, chemotherapeutic drugs can reduce the renewal of
blood cells, inducing a higher risk from infections or bleeding. Considering the side
effects caused by current chemotherapy, novel agents need to be developed.


1.1.3.3. Antibody-drug conjugates


     Receptor-targeted drug delivery is a promising solution in cancer therapy to
increase specificity and efficacy. With the targeting function of ligands, antibody-drug
conjugates can be directed to the target site after systemic administration, resulting in
increased therapeutic efficiency and fewer side effects.
     CD33 is a membrane receptor specifically expressed by myeloid blasts in AML
but not by healthy hematopoietic stem cells. To exploit this difference, gemtuzumab
ozogamicin (GO) was developed and approved by FDA as the first receptor-targeted
drug for AML treatment (Briot et al. 2018). GO is an anti-CD33 antibody conjugated
to the cytostatic drug calicheamicin, which would lead to DNA double-strand fractures
(Kohlschütter et al. 2008). However, life-threatening side effects of GO, for example


                                           12


anaphylactic reactions, have been reported and the increase in therapy-related mortality
slowed down the final approval by FDA until 2017. With a trade name of Mylotarg®,
GO is presently used to treat adults with newly diagnosed CD33-positive AML.
     FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is another membrane receptor mainly
expressed by AML cells (approximately 30% of all AML cases) and its most common
mutation is internal tandem duplication (ITD, approximately 25% of all AML cases)
(Daver et al. 2019). Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as sorafenib,
midostaurin and lestaurtinib, show potential activity against FLT3 and some of them
will be discussed below. Although some FLT3 inhibitors are undergoing evaluation in
patients with FLTS-ITD-mutated AML, their lack of specificity seems to be an
unavoidable hurdle for further application.


1.1.3.4. Novel agents


     Although the standard chemotherapy strategy (’7+3’ regimen) has achieved high
remission rates in AML, its severe side effects and limited solution for older patients
have stimulated exploration for novel therapeutic agents for AML treatment. Several
small molecules have been developed with the aim of blocking or damaging the
intracellular signaling cascades and thereby inducing cell death.


1.1.3.4.1. Clofarabine


     As a purine nucleoside antimetabolite, clofarabine is approved by the FDA for
treating relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children (Fig. 4). In
recent years, it has shown potential in AML therapy. A phase II trial of clofarabine,
idarubicin, and cytarabine as a frontline therapy was conducted in younger patients
under 60 years old with newly diagnosed AML. 74% of complete remission (CR) was
achieved and the median event-free survival (EFS) was 13.5 months (Nazha et al. 2013).
Clofarabine played a promising role in this study in prolonging overall survival (OS)
and EFS compared to historical patients treated with idarubicin and cytarabine only.
The standard intensive chemotherapy always provokes severe side effects in older
                                          13


adults with AML and thus a less toxic regimen is needed for this population. Kadia et
al developed a novel strategy for patients with newly diagnosed AML in a Phase 2 trial
(Kadia et al. 2015). After receiving clofarabine and low-dose cytarabine alternating
with decitabine, the patients achieved 60% of CR rate, with 11.1 months’ median OS
and 14.1 months’ median EFS. Moreover, the low mortality rates revealed that the
regimen was well tolerated.

1.1.3.4.2. Sorafenib


     Sorafenib is a TKI, approved for treatment for renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma (De Kouchkovsky and Abdul-Hay 2016) (Fig. 4). In
recent years, clinical trials in patients with FLT3-ITD-positive AML indicate that
sorafenib can induce growth arrest and apoptosis of leukemic cells or even complete
remissions. A phase I study showed that 5 (10%) of FLT3-ITD-positive patients
achieved CR after following treatment schedules of sorafenib, with an additional 17
(34%) of the responses being found reduction of leukemic cells in bone marrow and/or
peripheral blood blasts (Borthakur et al. 2011). Moreover, the combination of sorafenib
                                               14


with other agents was reported to have a higher therapeutic index and this further
improved the status of sorafenib in AML therapy (Al-Kali et al. 2011; Ravandi et al.
2014). Nevertheless, Serve et al carried out a placebo-controlled trial in 201 older
patients newly diagnosed with AML and finally found that the sorafenib-chemotherapy
protocol was not a benefit for elderly patients (Serve et al. 2013).


1.1.3.4.3. Midostaurin


     Midostaurin is another multi-kinase inhibitor that targets FLT3 (wild type and
mutated) (Wang et al. 2008) (Fig. 4). The role of midostaurin in combination with the
7+3 regimen and high-dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy was evaluated by
Stone et al in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of 717 patients with FLT3-
mutated (ITD or TKD) AML (Stone et al. 2017). Patients randomized to the midostaurin
group had significantly prolonged overall and EFS compared to the placebo group,
although there is no difference in the rate of severe adverse events (AEs) between the
two groups. AEs were often observed during AML treatment with midostaurin,
including infection, febrile neutropenia and lymphopenia (Stone et al. 2017). Another
phase I/II trial conducted by Strati et al demonstrated that the combination of
midostaurin and azacytidine is an effective and safe regimen in patients with AML and
high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (Strati et al. 2015).


1.1.3.4.4. Crenolanib


     Crenolanib is a second generation FLT3 TKI , showing potent inhibiting activity
against FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations (Chen et al. 2017) (Fig. 4). This extensive
inhibiting property makes crenolanib a promising molecule, justifying its inclusion in
multiple clinical trials. In a phase II study in relapsed/refractory AML patients with
FLT3 mutations, crenolanib was administered orally continuously for 28-day cycles.
The median EFS was 8 weeks and the OS was 19 weeks (Randhawa et al. 2014). More
clinical studies evaluating crenolanib in AML patients are ongoing, including
combination with “7+3” regimen (Wang et al. 2016).
                                           15


1.1.3.4.5. Quizartinib


     As a specifically designed second generation FLT3 inhibitor, quizartinib is highly
potent and selective, and is therefore a promising drug for clinical use (Fig. 4). In a
large phase 2 trial of 333 patients with relapsed/refractory AML, quizartinib showed
high activity and good tolerability, with 56% of FLT3-ITD-positive patients achieving
composite complete remission in cohort 1 (157 patients who were older than 60 with
AML within 1 year after first-line therapy) and 46% in cohort 2 (176 patients who were
older than 18 with AML following salvage chemotherapy or haemopoietic stem cell
transplantation) (Cortes et al. 2018). The findings confirm the clinical potential of
quizartinib as a single-agent strategy in FLT3-ITD mutated patients and opened the way
for a phase 3 trial, in which the efficiency of quizartinib monotherapy and its
combination with      standard chemotherapy was         evaluated (clinicaltrials.gov/
NCT02668653).


1.1.4. Repurposing of CPZ for AML treatment


     Although several strategies have been developed for AML treatment, including the
standard regimen and various agents being evaluated in clinical trials, it is still
necessary to search for new directions in therapy. Chlorpromazine (CPZ), a commonly
used antipsychotic, was reported to have inhibiting effect on AML cell lines and this
finding leads to its repurposing in the field of AML treatment (Table 2).

1.1.4.1. General introduction to CPZ


     CPZ is a well-known first-generation antipsychotic and has been regarded as the
“gold standard” for almost 70 years for the treatment of psychological disorders, despite
the appearance of several second-generation antipsychotics (Fig. 5). CPZ was first
synthesized in 1951 by Paul Charpentier in a French pharmaceutical company (Rhône-
Poulenc) and underwent clinical investigation in 1952 (Ban 2007). Subsequently in
1957, CPZ was approved by FDA and entered the USA market under the brand name
Thorazine®. With the improvement of clinical treatment of schizophrenia, the field
developed considerably.

     As a typical antipsychotic, CPZ acts by antagonizing dopamine receptors,
especially the dopamine D2 receptor. CPZ can be administrated either orally or
intravenously, leading to different types of metabolism. When administered by the oral
route, CPZ undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, whereas in the case of
intravenous administration, this first-pass metabolism is circumvented, thereby
obtaining a longer half-life. Hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes play a major

role in catalyzing the metabolism of CPZ, producing four main metabolites: mono-N-
demethylchlorpromazine, di-N-demethylchlorpromazine, chlorpromazine 5-sulfoxide
and 7-hydroxy- chlorpromazine (Robinson 1963; Boksa and Daniel 2010; Boyd-
Kimball et al. 2018) (Fig. 5).

     Phenothiazine and its derivatives are highly bioactive and possess a broad range
of medical applications, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, etc.
(Pluta and Morak-m 2011). Several different phenothiazines were reported to show
promising biological activity in inducing cell death via internucleosomal DNA
fragmentation in human myelogenous leukemic cell lines (Sakagami et al. 1995). As a
commonly used phenothiazine derivative, CPZ was used as adjuvant in anticancer
treatment for reducing vomiting (Davis and Hallerberg 2010). All this information
indicates the possibility of CPZ acting as an antitumor candidate.

     To the best of our knowledge, the application of CPZ in treatment of leukemia is
still an unknown field, since only a limited number of published works refer to this
topic. A noteworthy study is from Hait (Hait et al. 1985), who investigated the effect of
CPZ and chlorpromazine-sulfoxide on the growth of murine leukemic lymphocytes
                                              18


(L1210 and L5178Y) and human promyelocytic leukemia granulocytes (HL-60). CPZ
showed significantly stronger inhibiting efficiency than chlorpromazine-sulfoxide and
their IC50 values for the HL-60 cell line were 8 µM and 100 µM, respectively (Fig. 6).
This finding provides strong evidence that CPZ has the therapeutic potential against
human leukemia.


     In addition, Mello et al demonstrated the cytotoxicity of CPZ against chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) tumor cells (Mello et al. 2016). When encapsulated in a
poloxamer-based nanostructured system, the antitumor activity of CPZ was enhanced
and the selectivity against CML tumor cells was increased.


     Despite limited study indicating the therapeutic potential of CPZ against leukemia
related tumor, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of CPZ with human AML cell lines in
preliminary experiments. It was observed that CPZ exerts obvious cytotoxicity,
encouraging the repurposing of CPZ as a novel agent for treatment of AML. However,
as mentioned above, CPZ is a typical antipsychotic, which indicates its capability to
pass through the BBB and tendency to accumulate in the central nervous system.
Adverse effects at this level are an unavoidable obstacle and new strategies that could
block the central nervous system action of the drug are needed. Additionally, when
administrated by intravenous route, CPZ undergoes high but quickly decaying peak
levels in the plasma and this relatively short half-life is not enough for transportation to
and uptake by the target tissue. During the past decades, liposomes as an efficient
nanometric drug delivery system won the favor of researchers due to multiple
advantages. In our case, a liposomal formulation could effectively prevent crossing the
BBB and prolong the circulation time of CPZ by altering its pharmacokinetics.
Meanwhile, targeting to tumor site, bone marrow for instance, could be also achieved
by modifying the surface of liposome with appropriate monoclonal antibodies or
fragments. Therefore, liposomes could be an efficient tool to encapsulate CPZ for AML
treatment.

1.2. Liposomes

     It is generally believed that liposomes were first observed as phospholipid vesicles
by Bangham and his colleagues in 1965 (Bangham et al. 1965), who found that a
phospholipid membrane could maintain a concentration gradient of cations. In 1964,
Bangham had already identified a lamellar structure formed by lecithin in the electron
microscope with a negative-staining technique (Bangham and Horne 1964). The
definition “liposomes”, phospholipid spherules consisting of a series of lipid bilayers,
was first put forward by Weissmann in 1968 in a review and subsequently liposomes
were recognized as a promising nanometric drug delivery system (Sessa and
Weissmann 1968).

     It is worth mentioning that in 1971, Gregoriadis et al innovatively entrapped
                                               13I
Aspergillus niger amyloglucosidase and            I-labelled albumin within liposomes. After
intravenous administration to rats, most of radioactivity was found in liver and spleen,
which indicated that liposomes have the potential to be a carriers for bioactive
substances (Gregoriadis and Ryman. 1971).

1.2.1. Classification of liposomes


     The formation of liposomes involves a self-assembly process, with individual lipid
molecules forming a bilayer membrane (Fig. 7). Generally, liposomes can be classified
by their number of membrane bilayers and size. Base on the lamellarity, they can be
categorized as unilamellar (single bilayer) or multilamellar (multiple bilayers separated
by a aqueous phase) (Pattni et al. 2015). Different sizes of unilamellar vesicles have
been clearly identified: small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), large unilamellar vesicles
(LUV), and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) (Fig. 8) (Jesorka and Orwar 2008).

unilamellar vesicles (＜200 nm, SUVs), large unilamellar vesicles (200 nm∼1000 nm, LUVs), and

1.2.2. Components of liposomes


1.2.2.1. Phospholipids

     As the major components of biological membranes, phospholipids are commonly
used in liposomal preparation. Due to the wide distribution in nature, phospholipids can
be isolated from animals and plants at a relatively low cost, from egg yolk and soybean
for example. Nevertheless, such a natural source means a mixture of phospholipids,
both in head group and acyl chains, which can lead to instability of liposomal
                                            21


formulations during formulation storage and use. Another source is from chemical
synthesis. Synthetic phospholipids have defined structure and stable physicochemical
properties, whereas their high production cost is a drawback for extensive application.
     The chemical structure of these amphipathic molecules consists of a hydrophilic
head group and a pair of aliphatic side chains, linked by a glycerol bridge. The nature
of the polar group determines the type of phospholipid: such as phosphatidylglycerol
(PG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine
(PS), and phosphatidic acid (PA) (Li et al. 2014). Within each type, phospholipids can
be further classified by the length and saturation of the fatty acids. The assembly of
phosphate head group and polar moieties creates a variety of phospholipids with diverse
physicochemical properties. One of these that deserves to be mentioned is the phase
transition temperature: the temperature at which the phospholipids change from a gel
to liquid crystalline state, since it correlates closely with the pharmacokinetics of the
liposomal formulation.
     The lipid phase transition can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as
temperature, water content and lipid composition (Koynova and Tenchov 2013).
Generally, the lipid forms a crystalline phase (Lc) at low temperature, in which the
hydrocarbon tails are highly ordered (Fig. 9). In some situations, the lipid could form
more than one type of Lc in replacement of other subgel phases (Kulkarni 2012). The
crystalline phase would transform to gel phase (Lβ) on heating, in which the acyl chains
exhibit all-trans configuration and still have high order. In the Lβ phase, the hydrocarbon
chains are ordered parallel to the bilayer normal, but a tilted form (Lβ') would be
observed once the area of head group expands. With increasing temperature, the gel
phase transforms to liquid crystalline or fluid phase (Lα), where the tails are completely
disordered and the bilayer shows high lipid mobility. This fluid phase is the most
common state in biology which has been widely investigated with various techniques.
Between the Lα and Lβ phase, there exists a rippled configuration called Pβ' phase, which
is caused by the periodic modulation of the lipid lamellar (Khakbaz and Klauda 2018).
However, not all species of lipids show a Pβ' state.

(Kulkarni 2012); and DSC investigation on the thermotropic behavior of pre-transition and main-
transition (B), reproduced from (Pignatello et al. 2011).



     Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is a frequently used technique to study
the thermotropic behavior of lipid membranes, whether they are composed of pure lipid
or incorporating other substances (Bastos 2016). Most studies focus on the main
transition, which is a reversible transition from Lβ to Lα, with high transition enthalpies.
However, a pre transition can also be measured in lipids like phosphatidylcholines from
Lβ' to Pβ', with small enthalpies at lower temperatures than the main transition. It should
be noted that the pre-transition peak can be easily influenced by the scan rate.

1.2.2.2. Cholesterol


     The membrane composition of liposomes has a critical effect on their organization
and dynamics (Oliveira et al. 2014). In some cases, poor physical stability of the lipid
bilayer can lead to undesired leakage of encapsulated drugs. To circumvent this problem,
cholesterol, a common component of mammalian cell membranes, is added to the
composition (Fig. 10). Cholesterol plays an important role in altering the fluidity and
polarity of lipid membranes, which results in decrease of liposome permeability and
drug leakage. The incorporation of cholesterol into the lipid bilayers can be investigated
by DSC, with the change of thermotropic profile. For instance, at 30 mol% of
cholesterol incorporation, the phase transition of diacylphospholipids is eliminated and
the lipid bilayer is brought into a more stable state (Kohli et al. 2015). Furthermore,
similar disappearance of the main transition peak induced on the addition of cholesterol

                                              24


was detected by another technique, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
monitoring (QCM-D). When adding 32.5 mol% cholesterol to solid-supported lipid
vesicle layers (SVLs), no transition was observed, implying a homogeneous liquid
ordered phase in this situation (Neupane et al. 2018).

     Although the advantage of cholesterol has been proved in many cases, it is not an
ideal membrane component in some situations. For example, liposomes containing
cholesterol was found to exert a strong tendency to retain cisplatin inside and prevent
its release to achieve efficient cytotoxicity (Zamboni et al. 2004). Thus, cholesterol is
not necessarily an advantage in the formulation and its presence and its concentration
have to be considered in each case.


1.2.3. Mechanism of liposome-cell interaction


     There are several ways of interaction between liposomes and the targeted cells.
Liposomes can be adsorbed onto the cell membrane specifically or non specifically and
lead to different modes of drug release, as extensively described by Torchilin (Torchilin
2005) and Bozzuto (Bozzuto 2015) (Fig. 11). Concretely, when contacting with cells,
liposomes can be degraded by enzymes or certain cell membrane components and
release the drug directly into the extracellular matrix, followed by the diffusion through
cell membrane. This process depends on the hydrophobic property of the encapsulated
drug. Another route is the fusion of liposomes with the cell membrane, inducing the
discharge of drug into the cell cytoplasm. The most common way for the liposome-cell
interaction is endocytosis, in which the liposomes can either be delivered to lysosome

                                              25


by endosome, or encounter destruction during the transport process.
      The mechanism of the interaction is significantly affected by the state of targeted
cells and physicochemical properties of the liposomes, such as the size, shape and
surface charge. For example, smaller liposomes (diameter <150 nm) are more likely to
be absorbed via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and positively charged liposomes are
more easily taken up due to the negative charge on the cell membrane (Nogueira et al.
2015). Neutral liposomes show less interaction with cells, increasing the tendency of
drug release in the extracellular fluid. Additionally, a lack of surface charge would result
in aggregation of liposomes during storage (Bozzuto 2015).

1.2.4. Development of liposomes


     Since the investigation of clinical application of traditional liposomes in the 1980s
(Dagan et al. 1982), some breakthroughs in liposome research have accelerated the
development of pharmaceutical liposomal delivery. In 1990, lipid-based amphotericin
B (AmBisome®) was put on the European market as the first liposomal drug to treat a
broad range of fungal infections (Hann and Prentice 2001). Subsequently, the anticancer
drug Doxil was approved by FDA in 1995 (Allen and Cullis 2013). Considering the
development history of liposomes in the past several decades, four typical generations
can be summarized for the liposomal delivery system (Fig. 12).

1.2.4.1. Conventional liposomes


     Consisting of phospholipid bilayers, conventional liposomes can alter the
biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the encapsulated drug in-vivo, thus reducing
the toxicity to normal tissue and increasing drug delivery to disease site (Sercombe et
al. 2015). However, this kind of liposomes will be subject to opsonization with serum
components and taken up by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), especially in
the liver, leading to elimination from the bloodstream and a resulting short circulation
time (Hua and Wu 2013).
     Liposomes composed of PC with saturated fatty acyl chains have a longer half-life
in the blood compared with those containing unsaturated fatty acyl chains, and larger-
size liposomes are more easily eliminated from the blood than smaller ones (Senior and
Gregoriadis 1982). Senior has also demonstrated that positively charged liposomes can
be cleared rapidly (Senior 1987). Therefore, the efficacy of the drug is reduced. This
led to the development of “stealth” or long-circulating liposomes that can avoid rapid
uptake by the MPS.


1.2.4.2. Long-circulating liposomes


     Long-circulating liposomes are obtained by coating with hydrophilic polymer,
polyethylene glycol (PEG) for example, to reduce their recognition by serum
components and render them “stealth” in the bloodstream (Klibanov et al. 1990).
PEGylated liposomes (also called sterically stabilized liposomes) can significantly alter
the pharmacokinetics of the formulation and enhance drug accumulation at the target
site. The half-life of PEGylated doxorubicin liposomes in humans is as high as 45 hours
(A Gabizon et al. 1994). The first long-circulating liposome formulation approved by
the FDA was PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) (Doxil®/Caelyx®), which was
used to treat Kaposi’s sarcoma in 1995, to treat ovarian cancer in 1999 and to treat
multiple myeloma in 2007 (Olusanya et al. 2018).



                                           28


     Probable mechanisms to explain the longevity of sterically stabilized liposomes
have been critically evaluated by Moghimi and Szebeni (Moghimi and Szebeni 2003)
and they have indicated that PEG cannot completely prevent the activation of
complement system and that macrophages also play a key role. Moreover, although
liposomes grafted with PEG have a longer circulating time, the coating attenuates the
interaction between liposomes and the targeted site to some extent and finally reduces
the therapeutic efficacy (Ulrich 2002).
     Although PEG was regarded as the gold standard for long-circulating liposomes
and deemed to be harmless from a physical perspective, some evidence indicates that
PEGylated liposomes can lead to side effects by activating the complement system
(Moghimi and Szebeni 2003). Another strategy involves a removable PEG coating of
liposomes to improve the recognition and uptake by cells. With the accumulation of
PEGylated liposome at requisite site, the PEG moiety detaches due to the special
physiological environment, lower pH for instance, thereby increasing the drug capture
(Maeda et al. 2001).


1.2.4.3. Targeted liposomes


     Targeted liposomes were developed so as to increase drug accumulation at the
intended site and reduce toxicity towards healthy tissues, via coupling with various
available ligands, such as antibodies and their fragments, peptides, carbohydrates and
small molecules (Sapra and Allen 2003; Medina et al. 2004) Among the multiple
targeting moieties, monoclonal antibodies are preferable due to their better stability and
higher coupling avidity (Immordino et al. 2006). Furthermore, specific antibody
fragments such as antigen-binding fragments (Fab), single-chain variable fragments
(scFv) and dimers of antigen-binding fragments (F(ab’)2) are also commonly used as
active targeting ligands with higher safety in the plasma due to their reduced non-
specific binding, although their stability is lower when compared with the whole
structure (Peer et al. 2007).



                                           29


     To obtain targeted liposomes, a variety of chemical coupling methods can be
employed. Considering the diverse conjugation strategies, three kinds of basic reactions
can be identified: between thiols and maleimide derivatives, between amino groups and
carboxyl groups and between thiols and pyridyldithiols (Torchilin 2005). Among them,
thiolation of antibodies with Traut’s reagent (2-iminothiolane) has become a frequently
used method in recent years, through the ring-opening reaction of 2-imidothioester’s
cyclic group (Eloy et al. 2017) (Fig. 13).

     Early long-circulating immunoliposomes were prepared by decorating the surface
of liposomes with PEG and antibody separately, which could lead to steric hindrances
of the targeting ligand by the PEG chains (Torchilin 1992). Subsequently, with advances
in liposomal technology, the targeting moiety could be linked to the distal end of the
PEG arm so as to achieve specific delivery and long circulation at the same time. Using
plasminogen as a homing device, Blume et al (Blume et al. 1993) found that PEGylated
liposomes with Glu-plasminogen attached to DSPE-PEG 3500-COOH-terminus has
longer circulation time in the blood and higher target binding capability than “ordinary”
ones. Another kind of antibody-coating liposomes, cytoskeleton-targeting liposomes,
exhibit advantages to specifically targeting to hypoxic cells with secretion of myosin to
the extracellular matrix caused by membrane damage, especially in the case of
experimental myocardial infarction (Khaw et al. 1984; Torchilin et al. 1992).

                                               30


     As far as liposomes targeted with monoclonal antibodies or fragments are
concerned, some positive results have been achieved and most of the work has focused
on cancer targeting. HER2, a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor
family, plays a significant role in the development of breast cancer, since 20-25% of
breast cancer patients exhibit upregulation of HER2 (Eloy et al. 2017). Therefore, anti-
HER2 immunoliposomes have been constructed. Fab’ fragments of recombinant
humanized monoclonal antibody rhuMAbHER2 were conjugated to doxorubicin (dox)-
loaded liposomes, which showed significantly increased antitumor cytotoxicity and less
systemic toxicity compared with free dox in multiple HER2-overexpressing human
breast tumor xenograft models (Parka et al. 1997).
     EGFR is another critical receptor that is closely associated with different types of
cancers. Zalba et al prepared EGFR-targeted immunoliposomes with cetuximab (CTX,
a monoclonal antibody) and its Fab′ fragments for the treatment of colorectal cancer
(CRC). In the CRC xenograft model, drug delivery was significantly improved with
targeted liposomes. Interestingly, liposomes coated with CTX-Fab′ fragments showed
outstanding drug accumulation in tumor tissue compared with CTX liposomes or non-
targeted liposomes (Zalba et al. 2015). Furthermore, transferrin receptors and folate
receptors have also been targeted with interest because, similarly, they are highly
expressed in a variety of tumor types.


1.2.4.4. Multifunctional liposomes


     To meet the different requirements for current drug delivery system,
multifunctional liposomes have emerged carrying a combination of several
modifications in a single formulation. Currently, various versatile liposome
formulations have been reported (Riaz et al. 2018), such as liposomes with dual-
targeting (peptide T7 and DA7R) and co-delivery (doxorubicin and vincristine) abilities
for treatment of glioma (Zhang et al. 2017), liposomes simultaneously coated with the
near-infrared fluorescent molecule indocyanine green (ICG) and the cetuximab
monoclonal antibody directed towards the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)

                                           31


(Portnoy et al. 2011) and liposomes carrying a combination of therapeutic and imaging
agents (Li et al. 2012), etc.
     Although the applications of liposomes for drug delivery have been described
widely, their role as theranostics nanocarriers deserves to be presented, especially in the
molecular imaging area. The use of liposomes to monitor treatment progression has
several advantages, such as the possibility of combining a variety of imaging agents,
targeting to the desired site with a specific ligand and the enhancement of imaging
signal (Immordino et al. 2006). Faced with the short half-life of imaging agents, stealth
liposomes decorated with PEG with prolonged circulation time in the body after
administration can provide higher accumulation in the targeted tissue and a stronger
signal. Fluorescence imaging is the most commonly used theranostic strategy.
Quantum-dot functionalized liposomes (f-QD-L) hybrid nanoparticles have been
formulated by Al-Jamal et al, demonstrating improved targeting and internalizing
capability in tumor-cell monolayer cultures. Subsequently, extensive fluorescent
staining of tumor cells was demonstrated after injecting f-QD-L intratumorally into
solid tumor models, compared with f-QD alone. Taken together, this work indicates that
f-QD-L is an efficient imaging tool both in-vitro and in-vivo (Al-Jamal et al. 2008).
     As well as fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is attracting
significant attention as a non-invasive technique. Due to the versatile properties of
liposomes, multiple MRI contrast agents, paramagnetic Gd3+ for example, can be
incorporated into one liposomal formulation, obtaining efficient delivery and enhanced
imaging (Xing et al. 2016). Furthermore, the combination of MRI and an active drug
allows real-time monitoring and therapeutic intervention at the same time. Tagami et al
reported a multifunctional thermosensitive liposome with co-incorporation of Gd-
DTPA (an MRI agent) and doxorubicin. The success of simultaneous drug release and
molecular imaging in heated tumors in this study confirms the potential of liposomes
as nanocarriers for theranostic applications (Tagami et al. 2011).

1.2.5. Fate of liposomes after different routes of administration


     Liposomes are widely studied for treatment of many kinds of diseases, such as
cancer, infection and multiple sclerosis (Palazzo et al. 2019). In order to obtain
satisfactory therapeutic effects, several routes of administration have been studied,
including intravenous delivery, transdermal delivery, oral delivery and pulmonary
delivery. Depending on the route of administration, liposomes will be submitted to
different physiological conditions that will affect their stability and distribution and,
ultimately, their therapeutic efficiency.
     As the most commonly used delivery route for liposome, intravenous
administration possesses several advantages. For example, the systemic delivery
liposomes can avoid toxicity to normal tissue compared to free drug by changing its
distribution, as well as increasing the circulation time of the drug in the plasma by
PEGylation. Since extensive information about liposomes for systemic administration
has been provided above, “Stealth” and targeted liposomes for example, the sections
below will concentrate on other routes of liposomal delivery.


1.2.5.1. Transdermal delivery


     Skin drug delivery generally includes dermal (deliver to the skin) and transdermal
(deliver across the skin) delivery (Fig. 14). As a more attractive alternative compared
with oral or parenteral administration, transdermal delivery has various advantages,
such as avoiding first-pass metabolism, achieving controlled release and reducing side
effects (Sala et al. 2018). To permeate the skin barrier which is constituted mainly by
the stratum corneum and improve drug delivery efficiency, researchers have tried
different strategies and transferosomes were developed with enhanced permeation
capacity across the skin due to their “gel state” property resulted from special additives
(Cevc and Blume 1992). For example, elastic liposomes were reported to show
effective treatment for deep dermal infection with delivery of neomycin sulphate
(Darwhekar et al. 2012). Transfenac, a transfersomes formulation of diclofenac, was

                                            33


shown to be superior to the marketed diclofenac hydrogel by different kinds of animal
experiments (Cevc and Blume 2001).

     Another kind of liposomes designed to improve the penetration efficiency,
ethosomes, has been developed relying on ethanol’s penetrating properties (Fig. 17).
They were first reported in 1999 (Godin and Touitou 1999) and subsequently numerous
investigations have demonstrated their potential for clinical applications (Zylberberg
and Matosevic 2016).


1.2.5.2. Oral delivery

     Oral administration is a major route for drug delivery. However, the extreme
physiological conditions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract presents stringent
requirements for orally delivered liposomes, such as stability at low pH and in the
presence of digestive enzymes (Nguyen et al. 2016), and the ability to penetrate through
the intestinal wall into the blood (Torchilin 2005). Many attempts have been made to
improve the bioavailability of drugs delivered by oral liposomes, for example, chitosan-
coated liposomes have been reported to have enhanced mucoadhesive properties and to
allow increased bioavailability of alendronate in rats (Han et al. 2012). An insulin-
loaded liposomal drug delivery system has also been developed for diabetes mellitus
                                        34


(Hanato et al. 2009) and Wong et al (Wong et al. 2018) have given a detailed review.
To induce a better mucosal immune response in mice, PEGylated liposomes
encapsulating ovalbumin have been studied (Minato et al. 2003), as an example for the
development of oral vaccines. Moreover, for better oral drug delivery, surface
modification (surfactants, anionic polymers, etc.) of liposomes has been substantially
investigated to provide improved stability, increased solubility, controlled release and
enhanced adherence (Nguyen et al. 2016).
     Although liposomes for oral administration have undergone extensive
development in the past decades, critical advances are still needed to make these
nanocarriers suitable for clinical use and for commercialization. For clinical
applications, the main hurdle is to develop a full-featured liposomal delivery system of
the combines the desired stability, solubility and distribution in-vivo. The harsh
physiological environment of the GI tract is an unavoidable challenge and only
liposomes that have been carefully designed can survive. Additionally, these clinical
requirements demand a higher level of manufacturing technology in order to go on the
market, such as the quality control and storage conditions (Zhang et al. 2013).

1.2.5.3. Pulmonary delivery
     Owing to the large absorption surface and easy solute permeation, the lungs are
regarded as a promising route for drug delivery (Sung et al. 2007). Nanoparticles loaded
with therapeutic drugs can be non-invasively delivered to the lungs for either local or
systemic applications. Local pulmonary delivery for treatment of lung-related diseases
requires a lower overall dose, thereby reducing the accompanying side effects. In the
case of systemic delivery via the lungs, the thinness of the epithelial cell layer plays a
major role in the absorption of drug and this route allows hepatic first-pass metabolism
to be avoided (Sung et al. 2007).
     Advances in nanotechnology, especially in aerosol formulation, have accelerated
the development of liposomal drug delivery to lungs, which shows various promising
features such as sustained release, localization within lungs and lower systemic toxicity
(Misra et al. 2009). Liposomes containing procaterol hydrochloride were developed for
                                           35


asthma treatment by the pulmonary route and an extended pharmacological effect was
observed for 120 min in a guinea pig model (Tahara et al. 2016). Transferrin-conjugated
liposomes were assessed in-vitro, showing the potential for treatment of lung cancer as
a result of receptor-mediated internalisation (Anabousi et al. 2006). Pulmonary delivery
of peptides and proteins is always problematic but insulin within liposomes was
developed as an aerosol pulmonary drug with specific lung targeting and induced a
reduction of the plasma glucose level (Huang and Wang 2006). Therapy of tuberculosis
infection can also be achieved by improved delivery of rifampicin with aerosolized
liposomes (Vyas et al. 2004). Despite numerous investigations of the pulmonary
delivery of liposomal aerosols, further studies need to be carried out to better
understand the interaction between nanocarriers and the physiological structure of lung.
The absorption mechanism and biodistribution in-vivo are critical factors determining
the final therapeutic effect of pulmonary liposomes.


1.2.5.4. Brain delivery


     The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is composed of polarized endothelial cells with
tight junctions that form the capillary walls in the central nervous system, which leads
to an extreme limitation of the drugs available for cerebral diseases. More than 98% of
small molecule compounds and nearly 100% of high molecular-weight drugs cannot
cross the BBB (Pardridge 2003). To maintain the normal physiological functions of the
body, circulating compounds need to be transported across the BBB and this occurs by
several routes, including the paracellular pathway (small water-soluble molecules),
transcellular diffusion (lipophilic molecules), carrier-mediated transport (glucose,
amino acids, nucleosides, cyclosporin, etc.), adsorptive-mediated transcytosis (plasma
proteins) and receptor-mediated transport (insulin, transferrin) (Vieira and Gamarra
2016; Ramos-Cabrer and Campos 2012).

capillary, showing the structure of the BBB. (B) Different mechanisms for drug delivery across the
BBB. Copyright (Vieira and Gamarra 2016)



     However, for systemically administered drugs that need to reach the brain, the
BBB is effective in excluded these potentially toxic substances. In order to circumvent
this barrier, several strategies have been studied and liposomes were chosen as an ideal
drug delivery system due to their good biocompatibility and controlled release, and
especially their targeting capacity when coated with peptides or antibodies. Strictly
speaking, brain delivery of liposomes is not a general route of administration but a
specific targeting mode that belongs to intravenous administration. Based on different
transport mechanisms through the BBB, corresponding liposomal delivery systems
have been developed, such as liposomes that undergo adsorption-mediated transcytosis
(Helm and Fricker 2015) and receptor-mediated endocytosis (Salvati et al. 2013) (Fig.
15). Moreover, preclinical investigations have been carried out for treatment of
                                               37


neurological diseases. Rivastigmine liposomes showed better memory regain function
and improvement of metabolic disturbances in a rat model of Alzheimer’s disease
(Ismail et al. 2013). Chlorotoxin-coated liposomes encapsulating levodopa also showed
their potential to cure Parkinson’s disease in the methyl-phenyl-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP)-induced PD mice model (Xiang et al. 2012).
     As one of the most challenging tasks in drug delivery area, liposomes for brain
delivery still face a number of problems before they reach commercial application.
Apart from similar hurdles to other routes of administration mentioned above, stability
for example, brain-targeting liposomes must meet a higher level of biocompatibility
and biodegradability, since any accumulation of non-biodegradable substances in the
brain could cause unpredictable consequences. The latent side effects of brain-targeting
nanocarriers are still unknown. Therefore, further study, either in animal models or in
the clinic, should pay attention to this aspect, in order to facilitate the application of
liposomes for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Poovaiah et al. 2018).


1.2.6. Nano-sized drug carriers for AML


     In AML treatment, drugs are generally given by intravenous route, which not only
results in rapid elimination but also leads to adverse effects due to the lack of specific
targeting. Nanoparticulate systems with long circulating properties and passive
targeting capability to the malignant cells in the bone marrow represent a promising
strategy. Several nano-sized formulations for the treatment of AML are already
available on the international market. Among them, Vyxeos, a liposomal formulation
with encapsulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine, was approved by FDA in 2017 for
AML therapies. Briot et al summarized the drug-loaded nanocarriers involved in
clinical trials for treatment of AML in December 2017 (Briot et al. 2018). Based on
their review, the updated list of liposomal formations under clinical trials for treatment
of AML in May 2019 is presented in Table 4.

 1.2.6.1. Polymeric nanoparticles for AML

       Polymeric NPs composed of synthetic or natural polymers are one of the different
 systems used in nanomedicine to entrap hydrophobic or hydrophilic agents in different
 treatment strategies. In terms of AML, a number of preclinical evaluations are ongoing
 and one has already been enrolled for clinical trial. The clinical candidate drug
 AZD2811, an Aurora B kinase inhibitor, was encapsulated as polymeric nanoparticles
 with an ion-pairing approach (Ashton et al. 2016). Two kind of block copolymers (poly-
 D,L-lactide (PLA) and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) were used and in-situ ion pairing
 was developed to increase the encapsulation efficiency and decrease the release rate of
 AZD2811. Investigations on a HL-60-xenografted mouse model demonstrated high
 antitumor activity of these nanoparticles. Improved tumor regression and a more
 sustained response were also observed in combination with cytarabine (Floc’h et al.
 2017).


 1.2.6.2. Liposomes for AML

       As mentioned above, a liposomal formulation for treatment of AML, Vyxeos, with

                                                     39


co-encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin, was approved by FDA in 2017 for
treatment of adults with newly diagnosed therapy-related AML (t-AML) or AML with
myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Before it was released onto the market,
Vyxeos underwent a number of preclinical and clinical trials under the code name of
CPX-351. A phase 2 trial of CPX-351 was conducted in 126 older patients with newly
diagnosed AML in comparison with the standard 7+3 regimen (JE et al. 2014). Higher
response rates were achieved as well as a prolongation of EFS and OS among the
secondary AML subgroup, which stimulated the clinical progress and an upgraded
version was investigated in a phase 3 trial. In this study, a total of 309 patients aged 60-
75 years were randomized (153 to CPX-351 + 156 to 7+3 regimen) and the former arm
showed a significantly higher overall survival, event free survival, and response (Lancet
et al. 2016).
     Apart from these FDA-approved liposomes, several other liposomal formulations
are undergoing investigation. To minimize the adverse effects of extensive
chemotherapy in AML, Myhren et al formulated PEGylated liposomes encapsulating
both the anthracycline daunorubicin (DNR) and emetine, a protein synthesis inhibitor
that reduces the production of survival proteins. Furthermore, the surface of liposomes
was coated with folate for more specific uptake by AML cells and this multi-functional
liposomal formulation showed the potential to be a candidate for AML treatment
(Myhren et al. 2014). Safingol, a member of the sphingolipid family with anti-leukemic
property, was formulated in liposomes to overcome its low water solubility and dose-
limiting hemolysis. Liposomal safingol was found to be effective on a variety of AML
subtypes and can prolong the median survival time of SCID mice bearing a human
leukemia xenograft from 23 days (with free drug) to 31 days (Tan et al. 2012).


1.2.7. Biological challenges of liposome delivery


     As discussed above, liposomal formulations for treatment of AML are undergoing
investigations at different stages (in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical trials) (Briot et al. 2018).
In contrast to standard chemotherapy, drugs entrapped within liposomes have

                                              40


advantages for patients, reducing side effects and the emergence of drug resistance.
Targeted liposomes decorated with specific antibody or fragments against AML cell
lines seem to have a promising future. However, there is always a large gap between
academic research and the final commercial application of drug development. In the
case of liposomes, numerous obstacles lie in their way, one of which is the biological
challenge. Once administrated into the circulation system of the body, liposomes have
to resist physiological defense systems like any other exogenous substances. To achieve
the desired therapeutic effect, the first hurdle to be taken into consideration is the
mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), which is able to take up liposomes mainly by
phagocytic cells in the liver and spleen. Fortunately, the development of PEGylated
liposomes that significantly circumvent the clearance by MPS has confirmed the status
of liposomes in the nanocarrier drug delivery area.
      Generally, sterically stabilized liposomes were supposed to have no or limited
immunogenicity in the body, until a discovery by Dams et al in 2000 (Dams et al. 2000).
PEGylated liposomes were found to have significant effects on the biodistribution and
pharmacokinetics of the subsequent injections of PEGylated liposomes, both in rats and
rhesus monkey. Specifically, the blood content of 99mTc-PEG liposomes declined
dramatically after the second dose, accompanied by an obvious increased uptake in the
liver and spleen. This finding is named “Accelerated Blood Clearance” (ABC)
phenomenon and it significantly impairs the long-circulation advantage of PEGylated
liposomes if repeated doses are given. More seriously, severe adverse reactions could
be caused by the alteration of pharmacokinetics.
     After a number of investigations, Ishida et al found that the magnitude of ABC
phenomenon is correlated with the lipid dose, the time interval between injections, the
PEG-surface density and the drug encapsulation (Ishida and Kiwada 2008). Meanwhile,
a novel modified pH-sensitive liposome with a cleavable double smart PEG-lipid
derivative was reported, for which no ABC phenomenon was induced by repeated
injection. Another strategy is the replacement of PEG with another hydrophilic polymer.
Romberg et al used a PEG alternative, PHEA (poly (amino acid) poly (hydroxyethyl-

                                          41


L-asparagine) (PHEA)), to modify liposomes and demonstrated that PHEA-liposomes
had longer blood circulation times than PEG-liposomes (Romberg et al. 2007). Despite
the multiple solutions that have been proposed, the mechanism of the ABC
phenomenon remains unclear and deserves more attention.


1.3. Drug-cyclodextrins-liposomes (DCL) system

     Liposomes have been proved to be a versatile tool for drug delivery. However, the
liposomal formulation may undergo leakage or rapid release when encapsulating
hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules within the membrane, which largely impairs the
therapeutic efficiency. To obtain stable drug delivery system, a new approach was
developed in 1994 and named as “drug-in-cyclodextrins(CDs)-in-liposomes” (DCL)
system (Mccormack and Gregoriadis 1994). By entrapping the CD-drug inclusion
complexes into liposomes, the DCL system ingeniously takes advantage of both CDs
and liposomes.


1.3.1. Cyclodextrins

     Cyclodextrins (CDs) are a group of cyclic oligosaccharides (Jambhekar and Breen
2016). Since the first discovery in 1891 (Villiers 1891), CDs have been widely
investigated and used in various fields. The most common members of the CD family
are α-CD, β-CD and γ-CD, composed by 6, 7 and 8 glucose units and with cavity sizes
of 0.5, 0.6 and 0.8 nm, respectively (Fig. 16) (Zhang and Ma 2013; Sharma and Sharma
2001).

    Due to the special configuration of hydroxyl groups, CDs form a cask-like three-
dimensional structure with a hydrophilic outer rim and a hydrophobic internal cavity,
which can incorporate various hydrophobic molecules as inclusion complexes (Fig. 17).
The host-guest inclusion complexes can significantly change the guest molecule’s
physicochemical behavior, for example, improving apparent drug solubility (Brewster
and Loftsson 2007), protecting it from photodegradation (Mielcarek and Daczkowska
1999) and promoting controlled release (Hirayama and Uekama 1999).

1.3.1.1. Derivatives of CDs


     To satisfy the different requirements of CDs for pharmaceutical applications, a
variety of derivatives have been synthesized, including derivatives with higher aqueous
solubility (Szente and Szejtli 1999) or with an enhanced hydrophobic cavity (Del Valle
2004) (Fig. 18). For example, the water solubility of β-CD can be increased from 1.8%
(w/w) to 60% or more by hydroxypropylation (Qi and Sikorski 1999). Chemical
derivatives of β-CD, including the hydroxypropyl derivatives, sulfobutylether
derivatives and randomly methylated derivatives, have been comprehensively
described (Davis and Brewster 2004).

     Sugammadex (SGM) is a modified γ-cyclodextrin with the addition of eight
carboxyl thio ether groups. These modifications not only increase the encapsulation
capability of the cyclodextrin by expanding the cavity size, but also increase its aqueous
solubility. As the first selective relaxant binding agent, SGM is used to reverse
neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium, by forming a
concentration gradient of the drug between neuromuscular junction and the plasma
(Naguib 2007). Extensive investigations have confirmed the safety and tolerance of
SGM, and its biological inertness further extends its suitability for nanometric drug
delivery systems.


1.3.1.2. CDs complexes


     When mixed together in the solution, a dynamic equilibrium forms between the
water-soluble inclusion complexes and free molecules of CD and drug. Different
association models can be described according to the size of cavity and the hydrophobic
properties of CD and guest molecules, with a balance of several driving forces, such as
van der Waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions
                                                44


(Jambhekar and Breen 2016). Usually, the association ratio of CD/drug inclusion
complexes is 1:1 or 2:1. Additionally, it should be noted that CD can form inclusion
complexes with just a part of the guest molecule in some cases (Davis and Brewster
2004) (Fig. 19).
     The physicochemical properties of the free molecules of cyclodextrin and drug are
modified by their association, which allows a number of physicochemical methods to
be used to monitor the formation process. Thus, spectroscopic methods such as
fluorescence spectroscopy, UV/VIS spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy can be used to investigate the CD/drug inclusion complexes
(Jansook et al. 2018). Moreover, techniques that detect changes in the aqueous medium
are also commonly utilized, such as calorimetric titration and pH-potentiometric
titration.

1.3.1.3. Effect of CDs on the photostability of associated drugs


     In addition to the well-known property of increasing solubility of the guest
molecule, CD also has the capability to protect the drugs from photodegradation.
Tretinoin, also known as all-trans retinoic acid, is highly sensitive to light and its
photodegradation could be reduced by CD incorporation. In a comparative study of ten
different CD molecules, tretinoin underwent minimal degradation after 48 hours with
the CD’s protection, especially in complex formation with SBE-β-CD (Semenova et al.
2003).
     Another frequently used antihypertensive agent, 1,4-dihydropyridine, is also
photosensitive and this characteristic was studied for the drug and a series of its
derivatives. By forming inclusion complexes with β-CD, the ortho isomer showed a
200 times slower degradation rate than when it was in its crystal phase. In contrast, a
4-fold increase in the photodegradation rate was observed in the case of halogeno and
cyano derivatives. The reason behind this phenomenon lies in the different position of
-NO2 group in the phenyl ring (Mielcarek 1997).
     To investigate the effect of CD on the photostability of nicardipine, an agent used
for treatment of treat high blood pressure and angina, a variety of inclusion complexes
with CD were obtained. Consequently, either a photoprotective or an accelerating effect
was observed. Furthermore, stereoselective photodegradation was observed in the case
of β-CD complex, indicating two distinct photodegradation profiles with two different
kinetic constants (Pomponio et al. 2004).
     Despite the fact that numerous studies have demonstrated the protective effect of
CDs on the photostability of guest molecules, Kamiya and Nakamura found the
protective effect depends on the CDs. They investigated the function of several CDs
during the photodegradation of parathion and paraoxon and revealed that some kinds
of CD show an inhibiting effect, while others the opposite. The phenomenon can be
explained by the difference in distance between the catalytic sites of the host cavities
and the reaction centers of the included pesticide molecules (Kamiya and Nakamura
1995).

1.3.1.4. Pharmaceutical applications of CDs


       Due to the promising physicochemical and biological properties, CDs and their
derivatives have been widely used in pharmaceutical applications, such as drug delivery
(Loftsson et al. 2005), medical imaging (Zhang and Ma 2013) and other applications
that have been extensively reviewed (Davis and Brewster 2004; Jansook et al. 2018;
Manakker et al. 2009). Despite its low aqueous solubility, β-CD occupies more than
half of the medical market of CDs. The reason lies in its low cost of production (Fig.
20).

1.3.2. Drawbacks of CD-drug complexes


       Despite of the comprehensive application in pharmaceutical field, CDs and their
derivatives have to face several obstacles before their usage can expand. One of the
problems is the weak intermolecular forces in the host-guest inclusion complexes,
which can lead to easy dissociation of the drug in plasma followed by its rapid
elimination as a free molecule (Chen et al. 2014). Thus, the circulation time would be
reduced and it further results in lower efficiency. Another more serious problem is the
well-known phenomenon of incorporation of cholesterol and membrane lipids by CDs,
especially the derivatives of β-CD. Kiss et al carried out a systematic investigation with
15 different β-CD derivatives to investigate the mechanism of CD’s cytotoxic effects

                                            47


on Caco-2 cells. The cytotoxicity of β-CD derivatives was found to have a correlation
with their cholesterol extraction capacity, which depends on the number and position
of the methyl groups and the presence of ionic groups. Thus, the cholesterol-
solubilizing properties can be a predictive factor for CD’s cytotoxicity and hemolytic
activity (Kiss et al. 2010).


1.3.3. DCL system


     Liposomes have been proved to be a useful drug delivery system both for
hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs and several products have come onto the market
based on this. However, the direct encapsulation of a drug on the liposomal formulation
could cause instability of the drug delivery system and even rapid release after in vivo
administration because of incorporation of the hydrophobic drugs within lipid bilayers
(Maestrelli et al. 2005). After encapsulation, hydrophobic molecules locate in the lipid
bilayer rather than the aqueous core of liposomes. The limited space among lipid bilayer
will not only restrict the amount of drug that can be entrapped but also increase the
probability of leakage or release. Therefore, a novel strategy is needed to overcome
these weaknesses. To circumvent the drawbacks of drug-CD and drug-liposome
delivery systems, McCormack et al (McCormack and Gregoriadis 1994) proposed a
novel concept, namely DCL system. By encapsulating the CD/drug inclusion
complexes within liposomes, this strategy takes advantage of the properties of both CDs
and liposomes, preventing destruction of lipid bilayers by the drug and rapid release by
including it in CDs and increasing the retention time in plasma by entrapping the
inclusion complexes in liposomes. This attracted the interest of researchers and
numerous hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules have been entrapped in DCL systems
for further application.
     Temoporfin, a highly potent second-generation photosensitizer, was encapsulated
within liposomes in the form of β-CD inclusion complexes. The resulting temoporfin-
in-CD-in-liposome system was stable during 90 days storage and in vitro evaluation
demonstrated a homogenous accumulation of temoporfin throughout tumor cell

                                          48


spheroids (Yakavets et al. 2018) (Fig. 21). Lapenda et al reported a DCL system based
on trans-dehydrocrotonin (t-DCTN) and the evaluation on its antitumor activity
indicated that the liposomal formulations containing HP-β-CD/t-DCTN are a promising
strategy for its application in therapy (Lapenda et al. 2013). More applications of DCL
system are addressed in a comprehensive review (Gharib et al. 2015).

1.3.4. Impact of CDs on DCL


     Under certain conditions, the stability of DCL system can be undermined by some
kinds of CDs, which are capable of extracting lipid molecules from bilayers into their
hydrophobic cavities. Consequently, the exchange of drug and lipid molecules will
destabilize the structural integrity of the system. Thus, the role of CD is important and
the interaction between phospholipids and CDs has to be made clear.
     The properties of CDs depend on the type. The cavity size and lipophilicity of CDs
are two key factors that influence the interaction with phospholipids. According to
Puskas, the destabilization ability of CDs on DPPC bilayers is closely related to the
amount of CDs bound to the bilayer. Above a certain CD/DPPC ratio, any excess
cyclodextrin would act to destroy the vesicles. Studies conducted at the same CD/DPPC
ratio revealed that the destabilization ability is in the order: α-CD>β-CD>γ-CD
                                         49


(Chellam and Mandal 2013). Considering that the cavity size is the smallest in -CD,
the results above indicate that the hydrophobicity of CDs, which can determine their
affinity for lipids, seems to be the main cause of the destruction. To clarify this, Piel et
al carried out a systematic evaluation of the affinity of the most commonly used CD for
the two lipid components of liposomes, cholesterol and soybean phosphatidylcholine,
confirming that the effect of CDs on the integrity of liposomes is directly related to their
affinity (Piel et al. 2007).
     In the DCL system, the situation becomes more complicated due to the
participation of drug molecule. The affinity competition between encapsulated agents
and lipid components will decide the extent of the destabilization effect of CD. A
significant expansion of particle size in HP-β-CD/trans-dehydrocrotonin loaded
liposomes was observed during long-term storage, while liposomes without HP-β-CD
show higher stability. The difference could be explained by the stronger affinity
between CD and the lipid component compared with the drug molecule (Lapenda et al.
2013). However, if CD has higher binding force with the active ingredient, as was the
case for betamethasone for example, liposomes can remain intact even loaded with a
high concentration of complexes (Piel et al. 2006).


1.3.5. Preparation methods for DCL system


     In general, the methods available to prepare the DCL system can be divided into
two categories: passive loading and active loading. The encapsulation efficiency of
passive loading methods, such as thin-film hydration and ethanol injection, depends
heavily on the physicochemical properties of the lipid, CDs and drug. On the other hand,
in the case of active loading strategy, including pH gradient and ammonium gradient
method, amphiphilic molecules can be encapsulated with high drug/lipid ratios.


1.3.5.1. Passive loading methods


⚫   Thin-film hydration
     Thin-film hydration is a commonly used strategy (Fig. 22), in which a thin film of
                                            50


lipid is first obtained by dissolving the lipid with organic solvent, followed by solvent-
removing step under reduced pressure. Subsequently, an aqueous mixture of CD/drug
complexes is added to hydrate the film (Piel et al. 2007; Gharib et al. 2015).




Fig. 22. Preparation of liposomes by the thin-film method. Reproduce from (Gharib et al. 2015)



     The thin-film hydration is one of simplest ways of preparing a DCL system and
has been widely used in the literature. For example, Dhule et al prepared HP-γ-
CD/curcumin liposomes as delivery vehicles for osteosarcoma by the thin-film
hydration method, with promising anticancer potential both in vitro and in vivo against
KHOS osteosarcoma cell line and MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (Dhule et al. 2016).
Furthermore, liposomes containing CD/indomethacin inclusion complexes obtained by
the same method showed higher encapsulation efficiency and slower drug release
compared with conventional liposomes (Chen et al. 2007).


⚫   Ethanol injection
     Another frequently used method is ethanol injection. The lipid components are
dissolved in ethanol, after which the solution is injected in an aqueous mixture
containing CD/drug complexes stepwise under stirring. The ethanol is finally
eliminated under reduced pressure (Skalko et al. 1996; Gharib et al. 2015) (Fig. 23).
Based on this method, Skalko et al obtained HP-β-CD/nifedipine loaded liposomes with
                                               51


higher EE (77.7%) and higher stability in the plasma compared with liposomes
containing nifedipine (Skalko 1996). Both the phospholipid and the cholesterol
concentration were found to have effect on the size of liposomes (Shaker et al. 2017).

2015)



⚫   Dehydration-rehydration
     The    dehydration-rehydration       method,     yielding    liposomes     named dried
reconstituted vesicles (DRV), was first developed by Kirby and Gregoriadis in 1984
(Kirby and Gregoriadis 1984). To prepare DRV, empty SUVs are first obtained,
followed by mixing with same volume of aqueous solution containing CD/drug
complexes. After overnight lyophilization, the freeze-dried powder is rehydrated with
appropriate buffer and MLVs are obtained with relatively higher EE, due to the close
contact of drug molecules with phospholipids in the freeze-drying state (Fig. 24). The
DRV method has been widely used to prepare liposomal formulations containing
various substances, such as low molecular weight drug molecules (Mugabe et al. 2006),
proteins (Rodriguez-Nogales et al. 2004) and DNA (Pupo et al. 2005). The EE of DRV
is significantly influenced by the diameter of the empty SUVs, the properties of the
rehydration buffer and the experimental conditions applied during the whole workflow.

1.3.5.2. Active loading methods


     In contrast to passive loading methods, an active loading strategy applied in
liposomal formulations is more effective for encapsulating weak base drugs to a high
EE. Nichols and Deamer first reported the pH gradient method to prepare
catecholamine-loaded liposomes, after which the technique was widely introduced
(Nichols and Deamer 1976). In active loading, the drug molecules are driven into the
internal aqueous phase by a transmembrane pH gradient. Specifically, the unionized
form of drug can cross the lipid membrane easily, while it undergoes ionization in the
intraliposomal medium due to the lower pH and becomes “locked” inside. In 1989, an
evolutive form of the pH gradient method, ammonium sulfate gradient method, was
proposed by Gabizon (Gabizon et al. 1989). In this method, the active pumping force
originates from a transmembrane gradient of ammonium sulfate. Due to its efficient
loading capability, the ammonium sulfate gradient method has been used to encapsulate
various amphipathic drugs, for example, doxorubicin (Fig. 25).

     As the pH or ammonium sulfate gradient method depends on the weak base
property of the drug, a poor EE would be achieved for nonionizable molecules even by
the active loading. Sur et al synthesized cyclodextrins with multiple weakly basic
functional groups to transport nonionizable drugs across the liposomal membrane, in
the form of inclusion complexes (Sur et al. 2014). Consequently, the drugs were
actively loaded into liposomes and greater efficacy was observed in in-vivo evaluation
compared with free drugs.


1.3.6. CPZ-encapsulated DCL for treatment of AML


     In order to take advantage of the capacity of CPZ to inhibit the growth of leukemic
cell lines, we aim to design and develop a novel nanometric drug delivery system for

treatment of AML (Fig. 26). As discussed above, liposomes could be an ideal choice
for this application, with several advantages including the ability to prevent CPZ from
passing through the BBB and prolong its circulation time in the plasma. However, the
direct encapsulation of CPZ within the liposomes could compromise their integrity,
considering the amphiphilic property of CPZ. Unlike the aqueous phase distribution of
hydrophilic drugs, hydrophobic molecules are inclined to locate in the lipid bilayer and
such incorporation would cause leakage during the storage or even rapid release when

                                              54


administrated intravenously. Therefore, the CPZ-encapsulated DCL system could
provide a promising solution. By entrapping CPZ molecules within its hydrophobic
internal cavity and forming inclusion complexes, CD could efficiently confine the
majority of CPZ within the aqueous core of liposomes, which contributes not only to
the systematic stability but also the controlled release. Another well-known property of
CPZ is its photosensitivity. As mentioned above, CDs show a protective effect on the
photostability of guest molecules in most cases, indicating that CPZ may remain stable
in the DCL system.




Fig. 26. CPZ-encapsulated DCL for treatment of AML



     The DCL system is a sophisticated and complicated strategy, considering the three
relatively independent and interrelated ingredients: CD, CPZ and phospholipids. Since
any subtle change, ratio or type of component, has an effect on the physicochemical
properties of liposomal formulations, it is critical to perform a comprehensive
investigation in order to have an overall understanding of the interaction between
CD/CPZ, CD/lipid and CPZ/lipid.

2.1 Introduction

           Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive leukemia that usually results in
death after two months if untreated and even when treatment is successful, the relapse
rate is high. In particular, leukemic stem cells in the bone marrow appear to survive
chemotherapy. In younger patients, the outcome can be improved by allogenic bone
marrow transfer, but this option is not available for older patients who, furthermore,
tolerate intensive chemotherapy poorly. Therefore, there is a need to find new drugs to
add to the current arsenal, which is headed by a combination of cytarabine and
daunorubicin (Juliusson et al. 2009)(Döhner et al. 2010)(Lichtman 2013).

          A recent development in cancer chemotherapy is “re-purposing” – the application
of molecules already in use for other pathologies to cancer. An example of this is the
observation that phenothiazines, a class of drugs active on the central nervous system,
have anti-proliferative and pro-apoptopic effects in leukemia cells lines (Zhelev et al.
2004) This phenomenon may be mediated in part by an effect on mitochondrial

membranes, since the ATP content of the cells was observed to be reduced. Inhibition
of calmodulin and protein kinases, as well as the P-glycoprotein involved in multi-drug
resistance, have also been implicated (Jaszczyszyn et al. 2012). One molecule from this
series, chlorpromazine (CPZ), was found as early as 1998 to inhibit vincristine transport
in multi-drug resistant leukemia cells (Syed et al. 1998), again suggesting a membrane-
associated mechanism. CPZ and other phenothiazines are photosensitive and the
thiazine dyes methylene blue and toluidine blue can be used for photodynamic therapy
of tumors (O’Connor et al. 2009).

     More recently, Rai et al (Rai et al. 2014) observed that CPZ inhibited the growth
of human AML cell lines in vitro and in mouse xenografts in vivo. While recent studies
have been directed towards developing new phenothiazine derivatives with increased
activity against leukemia (Brem et al. 2017), a true repurposing strategy would use a
molecule already in clinical use, such as CPZ. However, to avoid undesirable side-
effects in the central nervous system, it is necessary to control the distribution of the
drug to prevent its passage across the blood-brain barrier and allow its accumulation in
the bone marrow that harbors the AML cells. Therefore, in this work, we have
investigated the possibility of associating CPZ with cyclodextrins (CD) to modify its
biodistribution to render it suitable for use in AML.

     CDs are cyclic oligomers of 6, 7 or 8 glucose units (, β and CD respectively),
providing a central cavity that can accommodate hydrophobic guest molecules. A wide
range of pharmaceutical molecules have been formulated as inclusion complexes in
order to increase their apparent solubility in aqueous media, improve their
bioavailability and stability and reduce their toxicity. Several studies have focussed on
the interactions of CDs with the blood-brain barrier in terms of toxicity and their ability
to modulate the activity of pharmacological agents. The cytotoxicity of a range of CDs
was studied on an in-vitro co-culture model (Monnaert et al. 2004). Based on the
passage of sucrose through the barrier, native CDs (, β and ) were the most toxic and
in general, substitution reduced toxicity. The effect of CDs on membrane integrity has
been linked to their ability to extract lipids from the bilayer. In particular, β-CD is able
                                            71


to complex and remove cholesterol from the membrane. The permeability of CD across
a brain endothelial cell monolayer has also been investigated. β-CD showed the highest
passage, but this was reduced by methylation or hydroxypropylation (Monnaert et al,
2004). However, the permeability constants were much lower than those for small
molecules. Numerous studies, reviewed in (Vecsernyés et al. 2014), have examined the
influence of cyclodextrin on the passage and activity of drug molecules in the brain. In
general, CDs can improve the efficacy of the drug without added toxicity. Interestingly,
this is not necessarily correlated with the presence of a drug in the CD, since a
therapeutic effect of hydroxypropyl-β-CD was observed in Niemann-Pick type C1
disease, due to its ability to redistribute cholesterol (Calias 2017).

     Some studies of the complexation of CPZ with CDs have already been performed.
Most of these studies employed β-CD, sometimes modified with hydrophobic chains,
and was observed that these complexes have 1:1 stoichiometry. Complexation with CD
resulted in a decrease in the haemolytic and photosensitizing side effects of CPZ,
without changing its activity in the central nervous system (Uekama et al. 1981)(Irie et
al.1985)(Hoshino et al. 1989)

     Therefore, in this work, we have undertaken a systematic study of the
inclusion of CPZ in a range of CDs, focussing on native CDs and derivatives that
are already authorized for pharmaceutical applications. We have used physico-
chemical techniques, and in particular isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to
thoroughly characterize the nature of the complexes formed with each CD. This
information will be essential for designing formulations using CD to control the
distribution and biological activity of CPZ.

2.1.2.1   ITC studies


     Formation    constants    and   inclusion    enthalpies   were    determined
simultaneously for each CD/CPZ system using an isothermal calorimeter (ITC 200,
MicroCal Inc., USA). CPZ and CD solutions were prepared in phosphate buffer
solution (pH 7.0). The sample cell and syringe were filled with a 0.4 mM
degassed CPZ solution (V0 = 202.8 μL) and a 4 mM CD solution (40 μL),
respectively. After addition of an initial aliquot of 0.2 μL, 10 aliquots of 3.7 μL
of the syringe solution were delivered over 7 s for each injection. This number
of ten injections was chosen according to Tellinghuisen's recommendation
(Tellinghuisen 2005). The time interval between two consecutive injections was
90 s, which proved to be sufficient for a systematic and complete return to
baseline. The agitation speed was set to 1000 rpm. The resulting heat flow was
recorded as a function of time. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
Prior to data analysis, blank titrations were carried out under the same
experimental conditions by injecting individual species into buffer, and/or buffer
into species and buffer into buffer in order to determine the heat of dilution.
These values were subtracted from the measured heats in the presence of CPZ
and CD. The peak area following each injection was obtained by integration of
the resulting signal and was expressed as the heat effect per injection. The
binding constants (KB) and inclusion enthalpies (ΔbH°) were determined by

nonlinear regression analysis of the binding isotherms by the means of an in-
house program developed by Bertaut and Landy (Bertaut & Landy. 2014).


2.1.2.2   NMR studies


     One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional off-resonance ROESY spectra
were recorded for β-CD, γ-CD and DIMEB on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer
at a magnetic field of 16.4 T ((1H) = 699.42 MHz) with a PATXI probe equipped
with Z gradients, at a temperature of 298 K. An improved version of 2D off-
resonance ROESY was used (Desvaux et al. 1995) with a continuous wave (cw)
spin-lock of 9.6 kHz and 300 ms mixing time.

     1D 1H and off-resonance ROESY spectra of the SGM/CPZ system were
obtained on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer at a magnetic field of 22.3 T ((1H)
= 950.13 MHz) with a cryogenic TCI probe equipped with Z gradients, at a
temperature of 318 K. 40 ms Gaussian pulses were used for selective excitation
in 1D ROESY experiments. 1D and 2D ROESY spectra were performed with a
4.5 kHz cw spin-lock and 200 ms mixing time.

     1D 1H spectra with 3-9-19 water suppression and 2D COSY experiments
were acquired at different SGM:CPZ ratios on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer
at a magnetic field of 14.1 T ((1H) = 600.13 MHz) equipped with a cryogenic
Z-gradient TCI probe and a SampleJet sample changer at two temperatures: 298
K and 318 K. Data were analysed by tracing Jobplots. Diffusion ordered
spectroscopy (DOSY, (Johnson et al. 1999)) was performed under the same
conditions with a stimulated echo pulse sequence using 2.0-3 ms bipolar sine
gradients, with a power level linearly ramped from 2 to 98 % in 16 steps, and a
diffusion time of 100 ms. The water signal was suppressed by excitation
sculpting. DOSY data were analysed with an exponential model in Dynamics
Center software (Bruker) to extract diffusion coefficients, D (m 2.s-1).

2.1.2.3     Computational details


     Initial geometries of native β- and γ-CD and DIME-β-CD studied in this
work were built using the LEaP program from the AmberTools16
distribution(Case et al. 2015). The sugammadex structure was obtained from the
Cambridge Structural Database under reference number AWEZIN (Xu et al.
2016). The fragments needed to build the native and DIMEB CD were taken from
the R.E.DD.B. database (Dupradeau et al. 2008) under project F-85 (http://q4md-
forcefieldtools.org/REDDB/) and the fragments needed to construct the
sugammadex and the CPZ ligand were parameterized and defined according to
the strategy developed previously (Cézard et al. 2011).


2.1.2.4     Molecular Dynamics Simulations


     The SANDER module of the AmberTools16 program suite was used to
perform MD simulations on all the cyclodextrin-CPZ complexes (Case et al.
2015). The systems were solvated in a truncated octahedral box with a buffer
distance of 10.0 Å along with sodium or chlorine counter-ions to neutralize the
system’s net charge. The q4md-CD force field parameters were used to model
the cyclodextrin systems (Cézard et al. 2011) and the GAFF force field (Wang et
al. 2004)    was used for the CPZ ligand. The parameters used for water were
taken from the TIP3P model (Jorgensen et al. 1983). After minimization, the
systems were brought to target temperature by ramping up the temperature over
periods of 25 ps followed by a run of 200 ps to relax and equilibrate the system.
Classical MD simulations of 50 ns were then performed using the NPT ensemble
at a pressure of 1 atm and a temperature of 300 K. The weak coupling algorithm
(Jorgensen et al. 1983) was used to regulate the temperature and pressure. The
temperature was maintained close to the intended value by weak coupling to an
external temperature bath with a relaxation time of 2 ps and the pressure to an
external pressure bath of 1 atm with a coupling constant of 2 ps. The shake


                                       75


algorithm (Ryckaert et al. 1977) was used to constrain C-H bonds, and a time step
of 2 fs was used to integrate the equations of motion. Periodic boundary
conditions were imposed during simulation. The distance cutoff of 9.0 Å was
applied to non-bonded interactions and the PME method (Essmann et al. 1995)
was used to compute long-range interactions. Configurations of the systems were
stored at intervals of 1 ps. Analyses of the trajectories were performed using the
Cpptraj module (Roe & Cheatham 2013) available in the AmberTools
distribution.


2.1.2.5    Ab initio calculations


     The conformational space explored using molecular dynamics simulations
was clustered with Cpptraj (Roe & Cheatham 2013) and powered by the
hierarchical agglomerative approach. A representative structure of each system
was obtained by clustering the conformations sampled in the corresponding
trajectories into ten representative classes, whose central conformations were
further minimized ab initio; the most stable structure among these was retained.
All ab initio quantum chemical calculations were performed with the Gaussian09
program at the M06 level of theory (Zhao & Truhlar 2008) using the 6-31G*
basis set. To estimate the influence of solvation, SCRF continuum calculations
were made in water ( = 78.3553).


2.1.2.6    Photodegradation studies


     A CPZ solution was prepared immediately before use at a concentration of 1.4 mM
with buffer (50 mM KH2PO4, 30 mM NaOH, pH 7). Subsequently, 3 mL of 13.5 mM
β-CD, 1.93 mM SBE-β-CD, 2.17 mM DIME-β-CD, 2.92 mM γ-CD, 6.3 mM SBE-γ-
CD and 0.7 mM sugammadex solutions were prepared by dissolving the CD powder in
the CPZ solution above and added into quartz cuvettes. Photodegradation was
investigated by placing the cuvettes at a distance of 2.5 cm from a UV lamp (VL-6.C,

μg/mL and 100 μg/mL.


2.3 Results and discussion

2.3.1 Cyclodextrin screening


        ITC is a very sensitive technique for determining the stoichiometry, binding
constant, enthalpy, and entropy of complex formation in a single experiment.
Firstly, we observed that complexation of CPZ with the smallest cyclodextrin, α-
CD (Fig. 1), displays a very weak constant at 25°C (see table 1, entry 1). Indeed,
from the fit of the binding isotherm, a stoichiometry, an association constant KB
and a binding enthalpy change ΔbH°of 1:1, 1.84 × 102 M-1 and -12.9 kJ.mol-1
were found respectively, leading to an entropic term - T ×ΔbS°equal to 0 kJ.mol-
1
    , indicating that the binding is solely enthalpy-driven. The association constant
determined in this study is identical to the value found by Uekama et al. at 25°C
and at pH 7.0 by UV-visible spectroscopy (Uekama et al. 1978).

      When the cavity size of CD was enlarged to β-CD, a higher association
constant and a lower binding enthalpy with CPZ were obtained (see table 1, entry
2). The association constant of about 1.18 × 104 M-1 is very close to the value
found by Otagiri et al. At 25°C and at pH 7.0 by UV-visible spectroscopy (Otagiri
et al. 1975) of 1.20 ×104 M-1, to the value found by Kitamura and Imayoshi at
25°C and at pH 7.0 by UV-visible spectroscopy (Kitamura & Imayoshi at al.
1992) of 1.05 ×104 M-1 and to the value determined by Hardee et al. by ITC of
8.32 ×103 M-1 (Hardee et al. 1978). Moreover, a binding enthalpy change ΔbH°
AND   an entropic term - T × ΔbS° equal to -29.9 kJ.mol-1 and 6.7 kJ.mol-1
respectively were found, showing that the inclusion of CPZ in the CD cavity was
completely enthalpy-driven. Hardee et al. were the first to report thermodynamic
parameters for the 1:1 β-CD/CPZ complexes with ΔbH°= -26.8 kJ.mol-1 AND - T
× ΔbS°= 4.5 kJ.mol-1 and the values obtained in our study are very close to their
values (Hardee et al. 1978). Shiotani et al. found similar values for the
thermodynamic parameters at 25°C, ie. ΔbH°= -28.4 kJ.mol-1 and - T × ΔbS°=
5.8 kJ.mol-1 (Shiotani et al. 1994). The negative entropy change could be mainly

                                               78


attributed to the tight binding of guest molecules in the CD cavity, resulting in
the loss of freedom of both CD and guest molecules.

      The use of methylated β-CD derivatives led to very different results,
depending on the derivative used. The low and randomly 2-O-methylated-β-CD,
i.e. CRYSME-β-CD, gave similar results to the β-CD (see table 1, entry 3). In
contrast, RAME-β-CD, a randomly methylated β-CD (12.6 OH group on average
replaced by OMe at positions 2, 3 and 6), showed a decrease in the association
by a factor of two (see table 1, entry 4). Moreover, in the case of RAME-β-CD,
the entropic contribution is not negligible and contributes about 20% of the Gibbs
energy change. In order to understand the impact of methylation better, two well-
defined methylated β-CD were used. On one hand, heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-
CD, or DIME-β-CD provided an increase in the association constant by a factor of
about two (see table 1, entry 5). On the other hand, the tri-methylated heptakis(2,3,6-
tri-O-methyl)-β-CD was not able to form an inclusion complex with CPZ (data
not shown). We can therefore conclude that: 1) methylation of position 2 of the
β-CD does not modify the inclusion properties of the cyclodextrin; 2)
methylation of position 6 increases the inclusion capacity, probably by increasing
the volume of the cavity and 3) methylation of position 3 has a detrimental effect
on the complexation by inducing a steric hindrance on the secondary side. It
should be noted that Uekama's group has reported an association constant for the
DIME-β-CD/CPZ complex (Ishida et al. 1988). However, the value of the constant
(8800 M-1) suggests that the study was performed with a DIME-β-CD that contained
over-methylated CD.

          The complexation of CPZ with HP-β-CD, which is generally recognized as
    safe and is approved as a pharmaceutical additive, was studied. An association
    constant and thermodynamic parameters similar to those of RAME-β-CD were
    obtained (see table 1, entry 6). Moreover, the value of the association constant is
    intermediate between the value found by Okimoto et al. from the phase solubility
    diagram (Kf = 7.01 ×103 M-1; (Okimoto et al. 1999) and that found by Piñero et
    al. by UV-visible spectroscopy (Kf = 3.27 ×103 M-1; (Piñero et al. 2012) and is
    close to that reported by Ishida et al. (Kf = 4.40 ×103 M-1; (Ishida et al. 1988).

     Next, a second safe and approved modified β-CD was studied: the well-known
sulfobutylated-β-CD (SBE-β-CD). The isotherm obtained during the titration of CPZ
by SBE-β-CD was analysed using a two-site binding model involved within a
sequential process (see table 1, entry 7). The binding constant measured for the 1:1
complex (K1:1 = 1.99 ×104 M-1) was one order of magnitude higher than that measured
for the 1:2 complex (K1:2 = 2.09 ×103 M-1). This difference could arise from a more
difficult access of the second CPZ molecule into the CD cavity. Okimoto et al. studied
the SBE-β-CD/CPZ complex by means of a phase solubility diagram and found a
higher association constant of 3.21 × 104 M-1 (Okimoto et al. 1999). This
difference is the result of the complexation model used by Okimoto et al., which
was a 1:1 model. The thermodynamic parameters reveal that the 1:1 process is
enthalpy- and entropy-driven while the entropic component is the main driving
force for the following 1:2 step. This favourable entropy change is probably due to
the displacement of ordered water molecules around (or inside) the cavity. The
formation of a 1:2 complex can be understood from the enlarged cavity generated
by chemical modification.

     Finally, with γ-CD and its derivatives, the formation of a 1:2 complex is
always observed and is the only type of complex formed in the case of
sugammadex. For γ-CD (see table 1, entry 8), the 1:2 binding constant was one order
of magnitude higher than that measured for the 1:1 complex. In 1978, Uekama et al.
found an association constant close to 1000 M-1 for a 1: 1 complex (Uekama et al. 1978).
This stoichiometry is not in agreement with the mixture of stoichiometries found in the
present study. On the other hand, using potentiometry, Takisawa et al. found similar
behaviour to that observed in our study with the same magnitude of difference between
the two constants (Takisawa et al. 1993). Moreover, these authors explain the great
stability of the 1:2 complex by the stacking of the aromatic rings in the large cavity of
γ-CD’s. From a thermodynamic point of view, the Gibbs energy change of the 1:1
complex is distributed approximately equally between enthalpy and entropy changes,
whereas in the case of the 1:2 complex, the complexation is entropically unfavourable

                                           81


(- T × ΔbS°= 42.0 kJ.mol-1) but this is counterbalanced by a strong and negative
complexation enthalpy change value (ΔbH°= -63.5 kJ.mol-1) which is the result
of van der Waals interactions, π-π stacking and possibly also hydrogen bonding.
The high and positive complexation entropy change is probably derived from the
loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom upon complexation.

     In the same way as for HP-β-CD, the complexation of CPZ with HP-γ-CD
is less efficient than with the corresponding native CD (see table 1, entry 9) and
the 1:2 binding constant value is about twice the 1:1 complexation constant. The
thermodynamic parameters show that the 1:1 process is enthalpy- and entropy-
driven while, as for the 1:2 step with γ-CD, the complexation is entropically
unfavourable but enthalpically favourable.

     In the case of SBE-γ-CD, as for SBE-β-CD, the binding constants are higher,
indicating that the complexation is more effective with sulfobutyl ether CDs (see
table 1, entry 10). The binding constant measured for the 1:2 complex (K1:2 =
7.38 × 103 M-1) was four times higher than that measured for the 1:1 complex
(K1:1 = 1.66 ×103 M-1). Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters for SBE-γ-CD
follow the same trend as for γ-CD with a preponderant entropic component for
the 1:1 process. For the subsequent 1:2 step, as for γ-CD, complexation is
entropically unfavourable, but the high negative enthalpy change value allows to have
a negative Gibbs energy change.

     Finally, the use of sugammadex (the octasodium salt of octakis(6-deoxy-6-S-(2-
carboxyethyl)-6-thio)cyclomaltooctaose) led to an unexpected result. Indeed, the fit of
the isotherm obtained during the titration of CPZ by sugammadex reveals a
stoichiometry equal to the ratio of 1:2 (the existence of a complex with a 1:1
stoichiometry could not be excluded but the amount is probably negligible) and
an association constant very close to 6.37 × 10 9 M-2. Hirai et al. were the first to
report the formation of pure 1:2 γ-CD/guest complexes and determined high
association constants for these complexes (Hirai et al.1981). It should be noted

                                          82


that the association constant of the 1:2 sugammadex/CPZ complex is the second
strongest constant reported in the literature to our knowledge. Indeed, an association
constant equal to 9.0 × 1010 M-2 was reported by the group of S.F. Lincoln for
the 1:2 γ-CD/roccellin complex (Clarke et al. 1986). Finally, the thermodynamic
parameters of the 1:2 sugammadex/CPZ complex follow the same trend as the other
1:2 complexes; that is, a very negative value for the binding enthalpy change and
an unfavourable entropy change.


2.3.2 Advanced thermodynamic characterization


       In order to obtain a deeper insight into the thermodynamic behaviour of the
complexes, the binding heat capacity changes were determined for the most
promising complexes. The heat capacity change ΔbCp°is defined as the first
derivative of binding enthalpy change with temperature at constant pressure. The
magnitude and sign of ΔbCp°is directly related to modifications of the well-
ordered solvent molecules present around hydrophobic or polar groups of the
host and guest molecules. From the temperature dependencies of the binding
enthalpy changes, a heat capacity change ΔbCp°= - 272.5 ± 0.1 J.mol-1.K-1 was
found for the interaction of CPZ with β-CD. Thus, the large negative values of
the ΔbCp°reported in this work are to a large extent due to the dehydration of the
apolar part of the CD and the guest molecule. In the case of DIME-β-CD, an
higher heat capacity change ΔbCp°= - 365.7 ± 0.1 J.mol-1.K-1 was found, which
could be explained by a higher degree of dehydration of the hydrophobic area of
the host and the guest. Moreover, the favourable entropic contribution
encourages the release of water molecules during the inclusion process. The
complexation of CPZ towards SBE-β-CD leads to a surprising result. For the 1:1
complex, a negative heat capacity change ΔbCp°= - 486.9 ± 0.1 J.mol-1.K-1 was
determined while a positive heat capacity change ΔbCp°= 309.2 ±0.1 J.mol-1.K-
1
    was found for the 1:2 complex. We can hypothesize that the longer sulfobutyl
substituents could entrap a larger part of the first included CPZ molecule, leading

                                         83


to an expulsion of more water molecules. For the second encapsulated CPZ
molecule, the positive heat capacity change reflects a conformational change of
the CD during the inclusion process (Brocos et al. 2011). This conformational
rearrangement corresponds to the passage from a flexible CD molecule to a tight
one. So, during the inclusion of the second CPZ molecule, the disordered
sulfobutyl arms must be rearranged to encapsulate the second molecule, since the
β-CD macrocycle is unable to bind two CPZ molecules.

    For the γ-CD/CPZ system, heat capacity changes ΔbCp°= - 513.3 ±0.1 and
- 385.1 ± 0.1 J.mol-1.K-1 were found for the inclusion complexes 1:1 and 1:2
respectively. The more negative value for the 1:1 complex compared with the β-
CD/CPZ complex is the reflection of a larger number of water molecules
involved during the inclusion process. Moreover, the less negative value for the
1:2 complex compared with the 1:1 complex could indicate a number of water
molecules involved during the complexation is smaller, but a concomitant
conformational rearrangement of the γ-CD macrocycle cannot be excluded.

    Similar behaviour was observed for the SBE-γ-CD/CPZ system (ΔbCp°= -
608.3 ±3.7 and - 150.2 ±7.9 J.mol-1.K-1 for the inclusion complexes 1:1 and 1:2
respectively). The lower heat capacity change value obtained for the 1:1 complex
in the case of the SBE-γ-CD compared with the γ-CD could be explained in the
same way as the 1:1 SBE-β-CD/CPZ system. Furthermore, the less negative
value obtained for the 1:2 SBE-γ-CD/CPZ inclusion complex compared with the
1:2 γ-CD/CPZ is probably the result of the rearrangement of sulfobutyl arms as
for the 1:2 SBE-β-CD/CPZ. Finally, the heat capacity change obtained for the
1:2 sugammadex/CPZ complex (ΔbCp°= - 619.2 ±0.1 J.mol-1.K-1) is of the same
order of magnitude as the 1:1 SBE-γ-CD/CPZ system and can be explained by
the fact that sugammadex can encapsulate two CPZ molecules with or without a
small amount of conformational rearrangement.

              Enthalpy-entropy compensation has often been observed empirically for
inclusion processes in the supramolecular chemistry field (Rekharsky & Inoue.
1998). This relationship between the enthalpy and entropy of binding suggest
that the enthalpic changes are offset by the entropic changes. The observed linear
relationship in enthalpy-entropy compensation plots follows from T × bS°= α
×bH°+ T ×bS°0 implying that the changes in entropy of binding are dependent
on enthalpy of binding with a slope α and an intercept T ×bS°0. The slope α and
intercept T × bS°0 of the T × bS° vs. bH° plot have been proposed as
quantitative measurements of the conformational change and the extent of
desolvation upon complex formation, respectively. In accordance with this, the
T × bS° are plotted against the bH° to obtain a good straight line with a
correlation coefficient r = 0.978 but the point corresponding to the
sugammadex/CPZ complex falls outside the correlation (Fig. 2). The slope α =

                                             85


0.93 ±0.06, comprised between the values reported by Rekharsky and Inoue for
natural and modified CD, indicates a rearrangement of the peripheral hydrogen
bond network and the accompanying skeletal conformational changes, while the
intercept (T × bS°0 = 18.4 ± 1.6 kJ.mol-1), very close to the value reported by
Rekharsky and Inoue for modified CD, means fairly extensive dehydration
occurs upon inclusion.


2.3.3 Structure of the β-CD/CPZ complex

     As only few publications report the 1D NMR spectrum of the β-CD/CPZ
complex (Takamura et al. 1983), the 1H NMR spectrum of an equimolar mixture
of β-CD and CPZ was recorded in deuterium oxide at 25°C. A comparison of 1H
NMR spectrum of β-CD (1 mM in D2O) in the presence and absence of CPZ was
performed to highlight chemical shift variations on the H3 and H5 protons located
inside the β-CD cavity and on the H6 protons located on the periphery of the
cavity (Fig. 3). The addition of CPZ to β-CD led to an upfield chemical shift
variation on H3, H5 and H6/H6’, consistent with the formation of an inclusion
complex. Moreover, the H1, H2 and H4 protons located outside the β-CD cavity
were also affected during the inclusion process, as an upfield chemical shift
variation was observed for the H1 and H4 protons while the H2 protons led to a
small downfield chemical shift variation. In the case of CPZ, it should be noted
that all protons (except the methyl protons) were affected during the
complexation (Fig. 4). With the exception of the H1 proton of the CPZ, the
formation of an inclusion complex causes downfield shifts in the plane of the
aromatic rings. Moreover, upfield shifts of all methylene protons as a result of
the addition of the β-CD were also found. A splitting of the three methylene peaks
was observed to result from the formation of an inclusion complex. This effect
was most pronounced with the Hα methylene protons, whereas the Hβ protons
were less affected.

     In order to have a better insight into the three-dimensional structure of the
inclusion complex, an off-resonance ROESY experiment was performed on the
same β-CD/CPZ mixture (Fig. 5). This revealed dipolar contacts between CPZ
and CD cavity protons. Strong interactions between the H3 protons of β-CD and
the H1, H4, H6 and H9 protons of the aromatic moiety of CPZ were observed as
well as between the H5 protons of β-CD and the H1, H3, H4, H6 and H9 protons
of CPZ. Other interactions involving the protons H6/H6’ of the β-CD and the
protons H3 and H4 of CPZ (weak interactions) were also detected. No interaction
between the protons H7 and H8 of the aromatic part of CPZ and the protons H3
and H5 located inside the β-CD were observed, indicating that a part of the
aromatic ring was outside the CD cavity. Moreover, for the aliphatic part of CPZ,
a strong interaction with the protons Hα and a weaker one with the protons Hβ
were detected with the protons H3 of the β-CD. All this information suggests that
CPZ enters the β-CD by the wider side of the rim and the chlorinated aromatic
part of the CPZ is deeply included within the β-CD cavity. It should be noted that
Piñero et al. showed that the same inclusion mechanism led to the lowest energy
during a computational study of the interaction of CPZ with HP-β-CD (Pinero et
al. 2012).

     Finally, molecular dynamic simulation of the complex was undertaken in an
attempt to have a better representation of the β-CD/CPZ complex. Taking into
account the results of 1H NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamic simulation was
undertaken, and all the snapshots were clustered into 10 structures to provide a
reliable ensemble of representative conformations. The best representative
structure, compatible with 2D NMR spectroscopy, was further minimized by
DFT calculations (Fig. 6). This structure totally explains the 2D NMR
spectroscopy results, especially the lack of cross-correlation between the protons
H7 and H8 of CPZ and the protons H3 of the β-CD, since the mean distances H7-
H3 and H8-H3 (considering only the 3 closest H3 protons) were equal to 5.2 and
6.0 Å for the H7 and H8 protons respectively. Moreover, the mean distances H3-
H6/H6’ (considering the 2 nearest H6 or H6’ protons) and H4-H6/H6’ (considering
the 3 closest H6 or H6’ protons) were equal to 3.6 and 4.3 Å for the H3 and H4
protons respectively, corroborating a strongest cross-correlation spot for the
proton H3 with the protons H6 or H6’ of the β-CD. As far as the aliphatic protons
of the CPZ chain were concerned, the mean distances Hα-H3 and Hβ-H3
(considering the 3 closest H3 protons) were equal to 2.8 and 4.3 Å and were in
accordance with the strong and weak cross-correlation spots observed for the Hα
and Hβ protons of the CPZ molecule toward the H3 protons of the β-CD.

2.3.4 Structure of the heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-CD/CPZ complexes


    As the heptakis(2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-CD, more often called DIME-β-CD, is
a well-defined cyclodextrin and gives a pure 1:1 complex, a precise structural
characterization was carried out using 1H NMR spectroscopy. As for β-CD, the
addition of CPZ to DIME-β-CD led to an upfield chemical shift variation on the
internal protons H3 and H5, on the peripheral protons H6/H6’ and on the external
protons H1 and H4 and to a downfield chemical shift variation on the external
protons H2. Moreover, the protons of the two methoxy groups located on the
periphery of the CD cavity were also affected during the inclusion process, as a
small upfield chemical shift variation was observed for the O6-CH3 protons while
the O2-CH3 protons led to a downfield chemical shift variation. For the CPZ
protons, the 1H NMR spectra led to a more complex situation as a broadening of
the majority of the protons was observed. Unlike the β-CD/CPZ complex, the
chemical shift of the H8 proton of the CPZ remains unchanged but a broadening
was observed. As for the β-CD/CPZ complex, an upfield chemical shift variation
was observed for the H1 proton of the CPZ but a small upfield chemical shift
variation was observed for the H6 proton unlike the β-CD/CPZ complex.
Moreover, the formation of an inclusion complex caused downfield shifts of the
other protons (H3, H4, H7 and H9) of the two aromatic rings. Considering the
aliphatic chain of the CPZ, an upfield chemical shift variation was observed for
all protons (included the N-CH3 protons) except for the Hα protons for which an
increase in the chemical shift was noticed. Furthermore, unlike the β-CD/CPZ
complex, no clear splitting was observed for the methylene protons.

effective angle: 54.7°, mixing time: 300 ms) recorded on a mixture of DIME-β-CD (1 mM) and
CPZ (1 mM).




     In order to obtain information about the spatial proximity of CPZ protons
towards CD protons, a 2D off-resonance ROESY spectrum was recorded (Fig.
7). In contrast to the β-CD/CPZ complex, a weak and a very weak interaction
between the proton H8 of the aromatic part of CPZ and the protons H3 and H5 of
the DIME-β-CD respectively were detected but, as for the β-CD/CPZ complex,
no interaction of the internal CD proton towards the H7 proton of CPZ was
observed, indicating that a smaller part of the aromatic ring was outside the CD
cavity. The same interactions were observed for the cross-correlation spots
between the other aromatic protons of CPZ and the internal protons H3 and H5 of
DIME-β-CD. Moreover, a very weak interaction involving the protons H6/H6’ of
the DIME-β-CD and the proton H3 of CPZ (weak interactions) were detected and
a weak interaction between the same CPZ proton towards the methoxy protons
O6-CH3 was observed, suggesting that the mechanism of inclusion was not
perturbed by the methylation of the β-CD macrocycle. Finally, the same
interactions as in the β-CD/CPZ complex were detected between the methylene
protons of CPZ and the internal protons of the CD but a very weak interaction
                                           91


between with the protons Hα and the methoxy protons O2-CH3 was observed.
With these structural data, a molecular dynamic simulation combined with DFT
calculations was carried out and the geometry of the DIME-β-CD/CPZ complex
was obtained (Fig. 8). The three-dimensional structure of the DIME-β-CD/CPZ
complex is very close to that of the β-CD/CPZ complex.

2.3.5 Characterisation of the γ-CD/CPZ complexes


      Only one report in the literature describes the 1H NMR spectrum of the γ-
CD/CPZ complex (Takamura et al. 1983). However, these authors described the
γ-CD/CPZ complex as a 1:2 complex. In our hands, since two γ-CD/CPZ
complexes, with 1:1 and 1:2 stoichemistry, coexist in solution, the γ-CD
concentration was optimised in order to maximise the amount of each complex.
The use of a low concentration of γ-CD gave the maximum yield of the γ-
CD/CPZ2 complex. In particular, the use of a γ-CD concentration equal to 0.87
mM led to a mixture containing 40% of free CPZ, 11% of the γ-CD/CPZ complex
and 49% of the γ-CD/CPZ2 complex in terms of CPZ concentration. On the other
hand, if a γ-CD concentration of 9.5 mM of γ-CD was used, the mixture
contained 9% of free CPZ, 44% of the γ-CD/CPZ complex and 47% of the γ-
                                               92


CD/CPZ2 complex, corresponding to the highest γ-CD/CPZ concentration.
Firstly, the 1H NMR spectrum of a mixture of 0.87 mM of γ-CD and 1 mM of
CPZ was recorded. Results similar to those recorded for the β-CD/CPZ complex
were obtained, but the phenomenon was less marked. Upfield chemical shift
variations on H1, H3, H4, H5 and H6/H6’ protons of γ-CD were observed, together
with a small downfield chemical shift variation for the H2 protons.

     However, as far as the aromatic protons of CPZ were concerned, the
situation was totally different, because upfield chemical shift variations of all the
aromatic protons were detected, and this was more pronounced for the protons
of the chlorinated aromatic cycle with a significant broadening of the protons H3
and H4 of CPZ. Moreover, considering the aliphatic protons of CPZ, upfield
chemical shift variations were also observed for all methylene protons as well as
with the methyl protons. In order to obtain a better description of the γ-CD/CPZ
complex, 2D off-resonance ROESY spectroscopy was attempted, but this was
impossible due to the weak overlap of the signals related to H3 and H6/H6’ protons
of the γ-CD and the coexistence of the γ-CD/CPZ and γ-CD/CPZ2 complexes. It
should be noted that no cross-correlation peak was detected for the H3 and H7
protons of CPZ towards the internal protons of the γ-CD, probably as a result of
the broadening of the peak of the H3 proton of CPZ and the proton H7 being
located outside the cyclodextrin, which was likely because only a weak cross-
correlation peak was detected for the H8 proton of CPZ towards the internal
protons of the γ-CD. A measurement at a lower temperature was performed with
the intent of separating the signal emanating from the free form and the
complexed form for the H3 and H4 protons of CPZ; however, this led to a larger
broadening of these protons and a splitting of the methylene protons of the
aliphatic chain of CPZ.

     Finally, the 1H NMR spectrum of the γ-CD/CPZ mixture containing a higher
concentration of γ-CD was recorded. In this case, the 1H NMR spectrum of the
γ-CD/CPZ mixture was very close to that of the γ-CD, which could easily be
                                         93


explained by the presence of 93% of free γ-CD. However, upfield chemical shift
variations on the internal H3, H5 and H6/H6’ protons of γ-CD were observed,
confirming the formation of an inclusion complex. Concerning the aromatic
protons of the CPZ, some differences compared to the low γ-CD concentration
spectrum have been identified. A downfield chemical shift variation was
observed for the H7 and H8 protons of the CPZ while a smaller upfield chemical
shift variation was noticed for the H3 and H4 protons of the CPZ. On the contrary,
a larger upfield chemical shift variation was detected for the H1 and H9 protons
of the CPZ. These differences in phenomena can be explained by a larger
proportion of 1: 1 complex in solution.

       Finally, our attempt to obtain additional data from a 2D off-resonance
ROESY spectrum was inconclusive for the same reasons as stated above. As for
the low γ-CD concentration, no cross-correlation peak was detected for the H3
and H7 protons of CPZ towards the internal protons of the γ-CD, again for similar
reasons, but with a high concentration of γ-CD a weak cross-correlation peak was
detected for the H8 proton of CPZ towards the H5 and H6/H6’ protons of the γ-
CD. Unfortunately, no three-dimensional structure could be determined in the
presence of the γ-CD.


2.3.6 Characterization of the sugammadex/CPZ complexes


       As for the other complexes, the 1H spectrum of a mixture of sugammadex
and CPZ in a molar ratio 1:2 was recorded at 25°C in order to compare it to the
1
    H spectra of the compounds taken separately (Fig. 9). A broadening of the
aromatic protons of CPZ in presence of sugammadex was observed; in particular
a large broadening of the H6 and H8 protons of the CPZ. An even more extensive
broadening of the H3 and H7 protons of the CPZ was also noed, since these two
protons could not be observed on the spectrum. So, in order to recover the signals
of these protons, the temperature was increased in order to restore a better
dynamic. At 45°C, all the protons of CPZ could be observed on the 1H spectrum
                                          94


of the sugammadex/CPZ mixture. In particular, the H3 and H7 protons of the CPZ
can be observed, despite considerable broadening, and the other aromatic protons
are much less broadened. So, a temperature of 45°C was chosen for later
experiments unless otherwise stated. An upfield chemical shift variation of all
protons of sugammadex was noticed except for the H2 protons for which a
downfield chemical shift variation was observed. As far as the protons of CPZ
were concerned, an upfield chemical shift variation of all aromatic protons was
observed as well as for the methylene Hγ and methyl CH3 protons while the
methylene Hα and Hβ protons were subject to a downfield chemical shift variation.
With the exceptions of some differences at the level of the aliphatic chain, the
same observations as for the γ-CD/CPZ mixture containing a low concentration
of γ-CD were made.

     In order to confirm the formation of a unique 1:2 sugammadex/CPZ
complex unambiguously, the continuous variation’s method, known as “Job’s
method”, based on 1H NMR titration experiments was used (See S5-8). This
method required that the total concentration of sugammadex and CPZ was kept
constant (1 mM) with the ratio ri being varied from zero to one (with i = CPZ or
sugammadex). Plots of the observed  i × [i] as a function of ri led to Job plots.
Taking into account the H3 and H5 protons of sugammadex, the Job plots showed
a minimum at rsugammadex = 0.35. As for the protons H1, H3, H4 and H7 of CPZ,
the minimum was found for rCPZ = 0.65. These values are consistent with a 1:2
stoichiometry for the complex, confirming the obtained result by ITC. This result
was confirmed by DOSY measurements at 25°C and 45°C. Indeed, at 25°C, the
diffusion coefficient for sugammadex, with or without CPZ, was equal to
Dsugammadex = (1.81 ± 0.06) × 10-10   M2.s-1   whatever the CPZ concentration. For
CPZ, a diffusion coefficient of CPZ Dcomplexed CPZ = (1.80 ±0.03) × 10-10 M2.s-1
was determined for rCPZ < 0.6 and an increase in the amount of CPZ led to an
increase in the diffusion coefficient to reach the value of the diffusion coefficient
of pure CPZ (Dfree CPZ = 4.68 ×10-10 M2.s-1). Similar behaviour was observed at
45°C with the following values: Dsugammadex = (3.89 ± 0.32) × 10-10           M2.s-1,

Dcomplexed CPZ = (4.02 ±0.26) ×10-10 M2.s-1 (for rCPZ < 0.6) and Dfree CPZ = 8.57 ×
10-10 M2.s-1.

     Finally, in order to obtain the three-dimensional structure of the
sugammadex/CPZ complex, a 2D off-resonance ROESY spectrum was recorded
and numerous cross-correlation peaks were observed on the 2D spectrum (Fig.
10). Firstly, due to the large broadening of the H3 and H7 protons of CPZ, no
cross-correlation peak was detected. One cross-correlation peak was observed
between the H8 proton of CPZ and the H5 protons of sugammadex and an another
between the H6 proton of CPZ and the H3 protons of sugammadex. For this last
CPZ proton, weak cross-correlation peaks were also observed towards the H6 and
Hβ protons of sugammadex. For the other CPZ aromatic protons (H1, H4 and H9),

                                         96


strong cross-correlation peaks were noticed with the H3 and H5 protons of
sugammadex and weaker ones were observed towards the H6 and Hβ protons of
sugammadex. In the case of the methylene protons of the aliphatic chain of CPZ,
a strong cross-correlation peak was observed between the Hα proton of CPZ and
the H3 and H5 protons of sugammadex while the two others methylene protons
Hβ and Hγ showed weak cross-correlation peaks towards the H3 and H5 protons
of sugammadex. Weak cross-correlation peaks were observed for the Hα and Hγ
protons of CPZ towards the Hβ protons of sugammadex and a weaker one was
detected between the Hα protons of CPZ and the H6 protons of sugammadex. It
should be pointed out that H6’ and Hα of sugammadex did not show any cross-
correlation peak with the protons of CPZ.

effective angle: 54.7°, mixing time: 200 ms) recorded on a mixture of sugammadex (0.5 mM) and
CPZ (1 mM).




     In order to obtain further data, a 2D off-resonance ROESY spectrum was
recorded on a 1:1 mixture but unfortunately no new information could be
                                             97


deduced from this spectrum. 1D selective ROESY spectra were recorded on the
1:2 mixture of sugammadex and CPZ in the place of the 2D off-resonance
ROESY spectrum. From these spectra, it could be seen that the H6 and H8 protons
of CPZ were located near the H3 and H5 protons of sugammadex. Moreover,
selective excitation of the Hα of the aliphatic chain of CPZ allows us to conclude
that these protons are close to the H3 protons of sugammadex. Taking account of
all these structural data, several three-dimensional models have been considered.
The two aliphatic chains are probably orientated in opposite directions, the first
being in the side-chains on the primary side of the sugammadex and the second
located at the secondary side of the sugammadex. Moreover, the first CPZ is
probably located in the extra cavity defined by the side-chains and more precisely
the chlorinated ring. Considering the second CPZ molecule, π-π stacking
interactions must be involved between the unchlorinated cycle of the CPZ
molecule that is deeply anchored within the cyclodextrin and the chlorinated
cycle of the second CPZ molecule. However, molecular modelling was not able
to confirm our hypothesis as the choice of the initial conditions strongly
influences the results obtained.


2.3.7 Impact of the presence of CDs on CPZ photodegradation


    As CPZ is photosensitive, we investigated the photodegradation of CPZ in
presence of a series of CDs (β-CD, γ-CD, DIME-β-CD, SBE-β-CD, SBE-γ-CD and
sugammadex). Based on the different complexation capability, different concentration
of CDs was used to mix with 1.4 mM of CPZ, to obtain the same percentage (95%) of
CPZ that could form complexes. As shown in Fig. 11, 77% of CPZ was degraded in
absence of CDs after 240 min, confirming the low photostability of CPZ. To simplify
the comparison, 240 min of UV exposure was used in the following discussion. The
photodegradation was enhanced in presence of all the CDs studied (see the
photodegradation profile in S11). For example, only 8% of CPZ was remained when β-
CD was added, while this value decreased to 1% in presence of sugammadex, although

                                        98


it has the highest complexation constant with CPZ. In addition, according to the residual
CPZ concentration as a function of time, we found the degradation of CPZ (with or
without CD) follows first-order reaction kinetics. The initial rate constant and
corresponding t1/2was listed in Table 2.

     In fact, CDs exhibit act as a photo-stabilizer in numerous cases. For example, the
photostability of Rhein, an anthraquinonic drug, was significantly improved by forming
inclusion complexes with β-CD and HP-β-CD (Petralito et al. 2009). HP-β-CD also
showed a protective effect on the photostability of cilnidipine (Hu et al. 2012). However,
                                               99


CDs may play a different role under some conditions. A systematic investigation on the
photostability of nicardipine was carried out by Pomponio et al, using a range of CDs
and either a protective or an accelerating effect was observed depending on the CD
(Pomponio et al. 2004). The mechanism by which CDs accelerate CPZ has not yet been
determined. A hypothesis could be that CD may act as a catalyst during the
photodegradation, thus further study on the degradation products would help to
elucidate the mechanism.


2.4 Conclusion

     ITC experiments showed that it was possible to form inclusion complexes between
CPZ complexes and different kinds of CDs. The stoichiometry of the complexes
obtained varied (1:1, 1:2 or mixture of 1:1 and 1:2), and sugammadex gave the highest
complexation constant. The association process was either enthalpy-driven or entropy-
driven, depending on the cavity size and the chemical modification on the CDs.
Structural investigation (1D NMR spectrum and 2D ROESY spectrum) of the inclusion
complexes, backed up by molecular dynamic simulation in some cases, revealed that
different regions or orientations of the CPZ molecule was included by different CDs.
However, all the CDs studied accelerated the photodegradation of CPZ. These results
indicate that cyclodextrin complexation of CPZ could play a part in a repurposing
strategy but that further formulation steps will be necessary to avoid photodegradation.

3.1 Introduction

     CPZ is a well-known first-generation antipsychotic and has been regarded as the
“gold standard” for almost 70 years for the treatment of psychological disorders. In
1985, Hait et al reported that CPZ and chlorpromazine-sulfoxide showed significant
inhibiting effect on the growth of murine leukemic lymphocytes (L1210 and L5178Y)
and human promyelocytic leukemic granulocytes (HL-60) (Hait et al. 1985). This
finding indicates the therapeutic potential of CPZ for AML treatment but a suitable
drug delivery system is essential to help CPZ to circumvent the BBB and target the
bone marrow.

     As explained in the introduction above, the drug-in-CD-in-liposomes (DCL)
system could provide a promising solution for the delivery of CPZ, by first entrapping
CPZ in the hydrophobic cavity of CD and encapsulating the CD/CPZ inclusion
complexes into liposomes afterwards. In order to optimize this system, the resulting
interactions between CD, CPZ and phospholipids need to be investigated and clarified.
In the previous chapter, the CD/CPZ inclusion complexes were systematically studied,
including the formation constant, complex structure and photodegradation of CPZ in
presence of a variety of CDs. Another property that needs to be investigated is the lipid-
extracting capability of CDs, due to the hydrophobic nature of their internal cavity. It
was found that CD (α-, β- and γ-CD) could cause a definite destruction of the
phospholipid bilayers above a CD/DPPC ratio (Chellam and Mandal 2013).
Additionally, Piel reported that the destructive capacity of CDs was closely related to
their affinity for lipid components (Piel et al.2007).

     To better understand the effect of CDs or CPZ on phospholipids, a critical
physicochemical property, lipid phase, should be addressed. Generally, there are
several bilayer phases for fully saturated phosphatidylcholine derivatives (Fig. 1). The
lipid can form a crystalline phase (Lc) when kept at low temperature for a long period,
in which the hydrocarbon tails are highly ordered on an orthorhombic lattice. The
crystalline phase can be transformed to a gel phase by heating, resulting in a tilted form
                                           113


(Lβ') with the expansion of acyl chains, which packed on a quasi-hexagonal lattice. With
increasing temperature (after the pre-transition), a ripple phase (Pβ') would form due to
the periodic modulation of the lipid bilayer. A liquid crystalline phase (Lα) can be
observed at higher temperature (after the main-transition) in which the tails are
completely disordered (Cunningham et al. 1998 ; Ruocco and Shipley 1982).

     Based on its phase transition behavior, the impact of CDs on the thermotropic
behavior of PSPC was first studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), a
frequently used thermo analytical technique. Subsequently, small-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) was performed to obtain the bilayer thickness while wide-angle X-
ray scattering (WAXS) was used to determine hydrocarbon chain packing.
Turbidimetry experiments were carried out to investigate the destruction or
solubilization of HEPC SUVs after the addition of CDs. Furthermore, an appropriate
CPZ concentration to prepare the DCL system was determined by DSC.

3.2 Materials and methods

3.1.1 Materials


     HP-β-CD (Cavasol® W7HP Pharma) and HP-γ-CD (Cavasol® W8HP Pharma)
were gifts from Ashland Global Specialty Chemicals Inc. SBE-β-CD (Captisol®), SBE-
γ-CD and SBE-Et-β-CD were gifts from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. Sugammadex
(Bridion®) was kindly provided Dr. Luc de Chaisemartin from Bichat Hospital.
Chlorpromazine hydrochloride, sodium chloride and HEPES were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Milli-Q water was obtained by a Millipore® purification system
(Millipore, Germany).

     Hydrogenated Egg L-α-phosphatidylcholine (HEPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine (PSPC), cholesterol (ovine wool) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] ammonium
salt (DSPE-PEG2000) were all supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Albaster, AL,
USA).


3.1.2 Methods


3.1.1.1    Preparation of liposomes


     Liposomes were obtained by the film hydration method. Specifically, the
components were dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, v/v), then
organic solvents were evaporated at room temperature under a gentle stream of nitrogen,
followed by drying under a vacuum overnight in order to completely remove residual
organic solvents. An appropriate volume of filtered buffer (10 mM HEPES, 145 mM
sodium chloride, pH 7.4) was added to the film to obtain a total lipid concentration of
30 mM. The lipid suspension subsequently underwent 10 repeats of 1 min heating at
62°C and 1 min vortexing. SUVs were obtained by extrusion (LipexTM, Northern Lipids,
Canada) through polycarbonate membranes (1×0.4 μm, 2×0.2 μm, 10× 0.1 μm) at 62°C.

3.1.1.2     Size measurements


     Mean hydrodynamic diameters of the liposomes were obtained by dynamic light
scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Corp., Worcestershire,
UK). 40 μL sample was diluted in 1.8 mL buffer (10 mM HEPES, 145 mM sodium
chloride, pH 7.4) for the measurements at 25°C. Size distributions by intensity were
recorded and the polydispersity index (PDI) was also acquired as an indication of the
size distribution.


3.1.1.3     Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)


     DSC measurements were done with a DSC Diamond calorimeter (Perkin Elmer).
CD solutions at different concentrations (range from 1 to 50 mM) were prepared with
10 mM HEPES (containing 145 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) and 90 mg of CD
solution was mixed with 10 mg of PSPC to obtain 10% PSPC (w/w). After heating at
62°C, 15 mg of the mixture was introduced into aluminum capsules. Samples were
subjected to repeated heating/cooling procedures in the temperature range of 20-65°C
(Table 1). Onset temperature and enthalpy variations (ΔH) of pre-transition peak and
main-transition peak were calculated.

3.1.1.4    Micro-DSC


     Micro-DSC measurements were carried out using a MicroCal Automated PEAQ-
DSC calorimeter (Malvern Instruments). To remove the thermal history of the sample,
a first heating scan was recorded between 25 and 80°C at a scan rate of 60°C/h followed
by a cooling scan back to the initial temperature at the same rate. Then, a heating scan
was recorded at a scan rate of 30°C/h between the same temperatures. The samples used
for the micro-DSC measurements were prepared as 10 mg/mL lipid suspensions in
HEPES buffer. Each measurement was preceded by a baseline scan with the buffer. The
heat capacity of the buffer was subtracted from that of the lipid sample before analysis.


3.1.1.5    X-ray scattering


     X-ray scattering experiments were performed on the Austrian SAXS beamline at
ELETTRA Synchrotron Light Laboratory (Trieste, Italy). The energy and wavelength
of the incident X-ray beam were 8 keV and 1.54 Å respectively. The samples were
thermostated in the laboratory-made sample holder, Microcalix, allowing both sample
temperature control and simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry analysis.
Simultaneous small-angle (SAXS) and wide-angle (WAXS) X-ray scattering patterns
were recorded using a Pilatus3 1M detector for the SAXS signal, and a Pilatus 100k
detector for the WAXS range. After 2D-image treatment in the SAXS experiments, the
scattered intensity was reported as a function of the scattering vector q = 4πsinθ/λ =
2π/d, where 2θ is the scattering angle, λ is the wavelength and d is the repeat distance
between two reticular plans. The calibration of the SAXS and WAXS detectors were
achieved using silver behenate and 4-bromobenzoic acid, respectively. The samples
were prepared as described in the DSC part (2.2.3) and then loaded into quartz
capillaries (Quarzkapillaren, Germany) with an external diameter of 1.5 ± 0.1 mm and
a wall thickness of 0.01 mm. All data were analyzed with the IGOR Pro software
(WaveMetrics, Inc. USA).

     Equidistant peaks can be obtained by SAXS in the lamellar phase of lipid, resulting
q1, q2, q3… The repeated distance of the bilayer can be calculated with Bragg law
(equation 1):

     The average distance between phospholipids can be deduced from Bragg law as
well as using the WAXS data.


3.1.1.6     Turbidity measurements


     Turbidity measurements were carried out by continuous addition of CD solution
into a quartz cuvette containing SUVs as described in the literature (Boulmedarat et al.
2005; Andrieux et al. 2009; Ramaldes et al. 1996) (Fig. 2). The optical density (OD)
was assayed at 350 nm at 25°C by a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 double beam
spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France) and recorded by computer. A
1mL precision syringe (Hamilton, Switzerland) on a syringe pump (Braun Perfusor VI,
Roucaire, France) was used to gradually inject CD solution into the liposome dispersion
at 27.8 μL/min. The raw data, recorded in the form “OD at 350 nm as function of time”
were converted to “OD at 350 nm as function of CD concentration” with the following
equation:

[CD]tot=([CD]0vt)/(V0+vt)                                                               (2)

where [CD]tot is the total concentration of CD in the cuvette at time t, [CD]0 is the initial
concentration of CD solution, v is the injection speed of CD solution converted by the
rate of syringe pump and V0 is the starting volume of SUV dispersion. Meanwhile, the
lipid concentration ([Lip]tot) decreased with the addition of CD solution and it could be
calculated with equation 2:

[Lip]tot=([Lip]0V0)/(V0+vt)                                                              (3)

Where [Lip]0 is the initial lipid concentration in the cuvette.

3.3 Results and discussion

3.3.1 Interaction between CDs and lipid bilayers


3.3.1.1     Impact of CDs on the thermotropic behavior of PSPC


     As a key factor in the DCL system, the interaction between CD and phospholipid
bilayers needs in-depth understanding. The thermotropic properties of phospholipid in
presence of CD were investigated by DSC. PSPC was as the phospholipid for this study
since HEPC is naturally occurring phospholipid with a mixture of fatty acids and PSPC
is the main species present in HEPC. Cholesterol was not included in the evaluation
because it would significantly attenuate the phase transition of the phospholipids
(Ohvo-rekila et al. 2002).

     Saturated phospholipids can exhibit several thermotropic phase transitions, such
as the main-transition and pre-transition, which have been extensively studied. For
long-chain saturated PC lipid bilayers, a low-temperature chain packing transition, sub-
main transition can be observed between the pre-transition and main-transition with a
low enthalpy (Jørgensen 1995; Pressl et al. 1997; Trandum et al. 1999). As this
phenomenon has never been described in the literature for PSPC and to have an insight
into it, we carried out micro-DSC investigations on PSPC. Fig. 3 shows the thermogram
of pure PSPC, with a clear main transition peak (Tm-onset = 48.7°C) (Fig. 3). In
                                             119


addition, the enlarged inset demonstrates the peaks of the pre-transition and sub-main
transitions, with T-onset of 35.3°C and 47.0°C, respectively. Jørgensen et al also
reported the occurrence of the highly cooperative low-enthalpy transition close to the
main transition of DCPC vesicles (Trandum et al. 1999). For the thermal experiments
with cyclodextrins, only pre-transition and main transition will be considered, as the
sub-main transition phenomenon is highly dependent on parameters such as ionic
strength, cooling rate and low temperature storage.




Fig. 3. icro-DSC thermogram for PSPC.




     In the case of PSPC with HP-β-CD, a range of concentrations of HP-β-CD was
prepared, from 1 mM to 50 mM (Fig. 4). The thermogram of pure PSPC (0.14 mM)
obviously demonstrated 2 transition peaks, a main transition peak (Tm-onset = 50.2°C
and ΔH = 53.8 J/g) and a weak pre-transition peak (Tp-onset = 38.7°C and ΔH = 2.61
J/g). These values are in accordance with the literature (Mattai et al. 1987; Chen and
Sturtevant 1981; Stumpel et al. 1983; Lin et al. 1990; Goto et al. 2008). Indeed, in the
case of pre-transition, temperatures between 37.5 and 40.6°C were found with transition
enthalpies of between 1.05 and 3.02 J/g. For the main transition, the temperature and
enthalpy ranges were between 48.2 and 52.0°C and between 45.8 and 56.6 J/g,
                                          120


respectively. With the increase of HP-β-CD concentration, a slight decrease of the T-
onset and T-endset of the main transition was observed but the whole thermotropic
variation was not significant, indicating that the molecule of HP-β-CD has no
interaction with PSPC even at 50 mM. This could be explained by the strong
hydrophilicity of HP-β-CD which remains in the aqueous phase of the lipid bilayer.
Nishijo et al also reported that the thermotropic behavior of DPPC was barely
influenced by β-CD, γ-CD and HP-β-CD, while in the presence of heptakis (2,3,6-tri-
O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin (TOM-β-CD), a decreasing Tm was observed in a
concentration-dependent manner. The hydrophobic character of TOM-β-CD was
regarded as the reason, assuming that it included the acyl chain of DPPC molecule
(Nishijo et al 1998).

     Similar results were obtained in the case of β-CD, γ-CD, sugammadex, HP-γ-CD
and SBE-β-CD. None of the CDs mentioned above showed any interaction with PSPC,
in terms of Tm, Tp and ΔH (Fig. 5). However, for SBE-γ-CD, the evolution of ΔH
revealed a slight interaction with PSPC.

     When higher concentration of SBE-Et-β-CD, 25 mM or above, were added, the
thermogram of PSPC exhibited significant deformation (Fig. 6). Concretely, the onset
of Tm showed slight increase but the ΔH decreased sharply in presence of 25 mM of
SBE-Et-β-CD, while the main transition peak was completely suppressed when 50 mM
was added. Although the detailed mechanism of the interaction between SBE-Et-β-CD
and PSPC was difficult to discern, the disappearance of the main transition peak clearly
reveals that the molecule of SBE-Et-β-CD penetrates into the phospholipid bilayer in
some way, indicating that the integrity of PSPC MLVs could be undermined in the
presence of SBE-Et-β-CD. As a consequence, SBE-Et-β-CD was rejected as a
candidate for liposomal formulation preparation.

     Several factors could influence the interactions between CDs and phospholipids,
including the length of the fatty acid chains of the phospholipid and the hydrophobicity
and cavity size of CDs (Nishijo and Shiota 2000). According to Huang and London, an
increasing concentration of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (from 10 to 60 mM) is needed to
solubilize the PC MLVs as the acyl chain length increases (from di C14:1 PC to di
C22:1 PC), possibly due to the unfavorable free energy when acyl chains are in contact
with water (Huang and London 2013).




3.3.1.2    Impact of CDs on the lamellar distance of PSPC


    To understand the effect of CDs on the lipid bilayers of PSPC in different phases,
SAXS was carried out. As mentioned above, SAXS can reveal the lamellar distance of
the multilamellar structure. Fig. 7A shows the SAXS pattern of pure PSPC hydrated in
10 mM HEPES buffer (10%, w/w). Two sharp peaks centered at 0.91 nm-1 and 1.84
nm-1 were observed when PSPC is in liquid crystalline state at 55℃, consistent with
the equidistant-peak feature of lamellar phase of lipid. Here, to compare the
transformation of the lipid bilayer in different phases, an average lamellar distance (d)
was used according to the q value at the different orders. Hence, according to Bragg
law, the lamellar distance is 6.87 nm at 55℃, which remains unchanged when the
temperature is 50℃. The results were slightly higher than those obtained by
Cunningham et al (6.70 nm) for the same phase for a sample hydrated in water
(Cunningham et al. 1998). However, for the Pβ’ phase at 45℃, the pattern underwent
broadening and the first order peak shifted to 0.84 nm-1, with a significant increase of
the distance (7.49 nm). The expansion could be explained by the periodic modulation
of the lipid lamellar in the rippled state. The peak centered at 0.57 nm-1 demonstrated
the corresponding periodicity of the ondulation was 11.1 nm.

CD (C) and PSPC with 25 mM SBE-γ-CD (D).




    A similar increase of the lamellar distance of PSPC from Lα phase to Pβ' phase was
also found by Mattai et al, who reported the d was 6.65 nm at Lα phase but 7.14 nm at
Pβ' phase (Mattai et al. 1987). When the temperature was decreased to 25℃, PSPC
formed a gel phase (Lβ') and the diffraction peaks became broadened, due to the
enlargement of the distribution of lamellar distances. The corresponding distance is
6.77 nm, which is in good agreement with the value (6.76 nm) obtained by Cunningham
et al (Cunningham et al. 1998).

    When PSPC was in presence of 5 mM of β-CD, no obvious difference was
observed at the Lβ' and Lα phase, with a slight increase of the lamellar distance by 0.03
nm and 0.05 nm, respectively. However, for the Pβ' phase, the distance increased
significantly to 7.80 nm compared with pure PSPC (7.49 nm), implying an influence of
β-CD on the PSPC bilayer at Pβ' phase. It is noteworthy that the periodicity of the ripple
phase could not be determined for all the cases, since the corresponding peak was

                                           125


broadened due to an enlargement of the distribution of the periodicity or a modification
of the electronic contrast.

     Similar results to those obtained with 5 mM of β-CD were observed when mixing

at 45℃, 6.92 nm at 50℃ and 6.97 nm at 55℃. However, when the concentration of

                                            126


SBE-γ-CD was increased to 25 mM, a significant effect was observed. Concretely, the
lamellar distance increased by 0.96 nm at 45℃, 2.83 nm at 50℃ and 2.73 nm at 55℃,
respectively, while a slight decrease of 0.16 nm was observed at 25℃. The expansion
of the lamellar in the Pβ' phase, especially in the Lα phase, implied that the molecule of
SBE-γ-CD began to penetrate into the lipid bilayer of PSPC MLVs at higher
concentration. Moreover, this kind of penetration didn’t occur at lower temperature, Lβ'
phase for example, probably due to the relatively high packing of the hydrocarbon tails.
Lamellar thickening was also observed when higher concentrations of SBE-β-CD,
SGM and SBE-Et-β-CD were added, while for γ-CD, HP-β-CD and HP-γ-CD, such
kind of influence was limited. The obvious lamellar expansion induced by SBE-Et-β-
CD at 25 mM or 50 mM confirmed the interaction that had been revealed by DSC.


3.3.1.3    Impact of CDs on the hydrocarbon chain packing of PSPC


     Typical WAXS diffraction patterns for PSPC with different concentrations of CDs
are shown in Fig 8. For pure PSPC hydrated in water (10%, w/w), the pattern revealed
a sharp peak centered at 14.74 nm-1 with a shoulder at 14.96 nm-1 at 25℃, which is
characteristic of the Lβ’ phase and indicates that acyl chains are tilted and packed in a
quasi-hexagonal lattice (Cunningham et al. 1998). The corresponding lattice parameters
(0.426 nm and 0.420 nm) are a bit lower than those obtained by Mattai et al at 22℃,
with 0.441 nm and 0.427 nm (Mattai et al. 1987). For the Pβ’ phase, the WAXS pattern
consists of a single peak at 14.77 nm-1 (d' = 0.425 nm at 45°C), which is in good
agreement with the value reported by Mattai at 37℃ (0.422 nm) and 42℃ (0.426 nm)
(Mattai et al. 1987). Additionally, according to Cunningham et al, the symmetry of the
peak in Pβ’ phase implied that the acyl chains were ordered in a hexagonal lattice
(Cunningham et al. 1998). The pattern of liquid crystalline state at 50℃ showed a broad
peak centered at 13.93 nm-1 (d' = 0.451 nm), which can be explained by the loosely

unchanged on increasing the temperature to 55℃.

and PSPC with 25 mM γ-CD (D).




     For PSPC with 5 mM of β-CD, the WAXS pattern of the Lβ’ phase and Pβ’ phase
showed no distinct difference compared to PSPC alone. For example, the lattice
parameter remained unchanged at 0.425 nm in the Pβ’ phase. However, in the Lα state
at 50℃, the distance (0.442 nm) was obviously lower than that obtained for PSPC alone
(0.451 nm), implying that β-CD influenced the acyl chain packing of PSPC in the liquid
crystalline phase.

     In the case of PSPC with 5 mM of γ-CD, similar patterns were revealed in the Lβ’
phase (q1=14.73 nm-1, q2=14.97 nm-1) and Pβ’ phase (q=14.79 nm-1). Nevertheless, the
space underwent a small decrease in the Lα state, with 0.445 nm at 50℃ and 0.447 nm
at 55℃, respectively. To further investigate the effect of γ-CD at higher concentration,
25 mM of γ-CD was added and similar patterns were observed, suggesting that γ-CD
had limited impact on the acyl chain order of PSPC even at 25 mM. Moreover, no
significant effect was found with the addition of different concentrations (5 mM and 25
                                          128


mM) of HP-β-CD, HP-γ-CD, SBE-β-CD, SBE-γ-CD and SGM. For SBE-Et-β-CD, a
higher concentration was used (50 mM), resulting in a pattern similar to those in
presence of lower concentrations. Although the SAXS results revealed an obvious
impact of SBE-Et-β-CD on the lamellar distance of PSPC, the limited disturbance in
the hydrocarbon chain packing indicated that the interaction between SBE-Et-β-CD and
PSPC occurred mainly near the polar group but not in the alkyl chain region of the lipid
lamellae.

3.3.2 Stability of liposomes in presence of CDs


3.3.2.1     Effect of CDs on the stability of SUVs with cholesterol


     To evaluate the effect of CD on the stability of SUVs, turbidity experiments were
performed. Turbidimetry has been widely used as a simple but effective technique to
investigate various properties of liposomes, such as permeability (Cohen and Bangham
1972) and dissolution (Wang et al. 2013). Wang et al gave a simplified schematic
diagram to illustrate this technique (Wang et al. 2018) (Fig. 9). By measuring the
intensity of light that is transmitted through the liposomal dispersion, turbidity can be
regarded as a key indicator that reveals changes in physicochemical properties. In the
present experiments, by adding CD solution into the SUV dispersion at a defined speed,
the concentration of CD increases gradually until it is high enough to destroy or
solubilize the phospholipid bilayers, resulting in an increase in the amount of light that
reaches the detector.

     According to previous studies, a typical profile can be used to demonstrate the
process of solubilization of liposomes (Boulmedarat et al. 2005; Andrieux et al. 2009)
(Fig. 10). Generally, the liposomes would undergo a vesicle-micelle transition, along
with aggregation of the vesicles induced by the addition of substances such as calcium
ions (Fatouros et al. 2005). Characteristic points are obtained by drawing tangents on
the curve, which represent different stages of the solubilization process. In phase A, the
turbidity decreases stepwise linearly because of the dilution of the initial liposomes. A
slight but longer period of decrease then follows, namely phase B, indicating the onset
of solubilization and destruction of vesicles. Subsequently, the turbidity drops sharply
as a majority of liposomes start to become micelles at this stage (C). Finally, all the
liposomes are solubilized and the suspension becomes transparent. Only a limited OD
decrease can be observed in stage D. This typical profile allows turbidity experiments
to be analyzed in more detail, but it should be noted that the solubilization process
varies under different condition, depending on the physicochemical properties of the
liposomes and additives.

     Firstly, to test our method and assess the accuracy of the turbidity measurements,
HEPES buffer without CD was injected into a 1 mM liposomal suspension, so that the
liposomes were gradually diluted.        Fig. 11 shows the concentration of lipids and
corresponding OD as a function of time, revealing a close correlation. An excellent
linear relationship was obtained between the two parameters, confirming the feasibility
and precision of the method.

function of time (A), and the corresponding absorbance with respect to lipid concentration (B).




     Subsequently, to investigate the stability of liposomes in presence of CDs, SUVs
consisting of HEPC, cholesterol and DSPE-PEG2000 (60:35:5 mol ratio) were prepared
by extrusion with 135 nm diameter and diluted to 0.5 mM, 0.75 mM and 1 mM as the
starting concentration for turbidity measurements (Fig. 12). γ-CD solution was
gradually injected into the SUVs dispersion, leading to slow decrease of the optical
density (OD). For example, the initial OD of 0.5 mM SUVs was 0.3, decreasing to 0.15
when the γ-CD concentration reached 50 mM. In contrast to the typical profile

                                             132


mentioned above, no characteristic points were observed on the curve of γ-CD,
indicating that γ-CD did not disrupt the liposomes and the decrease of turbidity was
entirely due to the dilution factor. Moreover, a higher initial concentration of liposomes
demonstrated a higher level of turbidity, which is in agreement with the proportionality
of absorbance illustrated in Fig. 11.

     In contrast, the smooth decreasing curve showed distortion with the addition of
SBE-Et-β-CD into the same SUVs suspension, at an initial concentration between 0.5
mM and 1 mM, revealing that the SUVs became unstable and underwent a vesicle-
micelle transition in presence of SBE-Et-β-CD (Fig. 12B). The disruptive capability of
SBE-Et-β-CD observed in the turbidity experiment is in good agreement with the
results acquired by DSC, confirming that SBE-Et-β-CD is an inappropriate candidate
for the DCL system. A similar experiment was performed with β-CD, but the final CD
concentration was 5 mM because of its low solubility in water (Fig. 12C).

(B), SBE-β-CD (C) and SBE-γ-CD (D).




     HP-β-CD, HP-γ-CD and SBE-β-CD were also evaluated and none of these CDs
showed negative effect on the integrity of SUVs, with highly similar decreasing profiles
(Fig. 13A, B and C). However, in the case of SBE-γ-CD, the slope of the turbidity curve
tended to be flattened, especially for 0.5 mM SUVs (Fig. 13D). The reduction of the
                                           134


downward trend indicates that a small amount of aggregation of the liposomes occurred
during the addition of SBE-γ-CD, since larger liposomes would scatter more light.
Apparently, SUVs at a lower initial concentration are more susceptible to this effect,
compared with those starting at 0.75 mM or 1 mM.


3.3.2.2     Effect of CDs on the stability of SUVs without cholesterol

     SUVs consisting of HEPC and DSPE-PEG2000 (95:5 mol ratio) were also studied,
in order to investigate the role of cholesterol in the integrity of SUVs (Fig. 14). As for
the turbidity experiment performed above, liposomes with starting concentrations of
0.5 mM, 0.75 mM and 1 mM were prepared, with the addition of γ-CD at the same
speed. The turbidity decreased gradually with similar trends to those of SUVs with
cholesterol, indicating that the liposomes remained stable during the process even
without cholesterol.

     However, when SBE-Et-β-CD was added, the absorbance curve clearly revealed
that it caused instability for both concentrations of liposomes (0.75 mM and 1 mM).
Compared with SUVs containing cholesterol, liposomes without cholesterol exhibited
lower stability, which is in agreement with the literature and demonstrated the role of
cholesterol in enhancing the stability of formulations (Kohli et al. 2014).

(B), SBE-β-CD (C) and SBE-γ-CD (D).
                                            136


     Furthermore, the effect of β-CD was investigated and no damaging phenomenon
was observed for SUVs without cholesterol (Fig. 15). The stability of SUVs in presence
of HP-β-CD, HP-γ-CD, SBE-β-CD and SBE-γ-CD was also assessed. In all cases,
SUVs remained intact, except with SBE-γ-CD. When the SBE-γ-CD solution was
injected into 0.5 mM SUVs, the turbidity underwent a slight increase, implying an
aggregation of liposomes. Therefore, SBE-γ-CD may not be a suitable lipid to prepare
the DCL system when there is a high CD/lipid ratio.




3.3.3 Interaction between CPZ and lipid bilayers


     To better understand the stability of the DCL system, the interaction between CPZ
and phospholipid is also a critical issue to be investigated. The encapsulation efficiency
of CPZ is an important parameter of the liposomal formulation; however, considering
the amphiphilic property of CPZ, a large amount of drug inserted into the liposomal
membrane may increase the permeability of the system and reduce its circulation time
after intravenous administration. Therefore, the interaction of CPZ with PSPC model
membranes was investigated by DSC as for CDs above.

     Fig. 16 clearly shows that the main transition of PSPC (onset Tm = 49.5℃ and
ΔH = 55.18 J/g) was reduced in amplitude and tended to shift to lower temperatures
with increasing molar ratios of CPZ. This could be explained by the amphipathic
properties of CPZ, which allow it to penetrate into the MLVs bilayer even at a low
CPZ/PSPC molar ratio. When the molar ratio reached 10%, two peaks appeared on the
thermogram and the peak at lower temperature increased in size and shifted towards
lower temperature. No saturation was observed even at a CPZ/PSPC molar ratio as high
as 45%.

     A similar study was carried out by Banerjee et al to investigate the interaction
between CPZ and DPPC (Banerjee et al. 1999). They demonstrated the evolution of the
calorimetric profile for DPPC MLV as a function of the amount of CPZ from 2% to
30%. As in our study, the main transition peak of DPPC was found to decrease and
gradually become broader and flatter. At pH 4.5, a saturation of the transition
temperature shift was obtained when 60% of CPZ was added.

     Although 45% of CPZ does not saturate the PSPC membrane, the stability of
liposomes is a priority for the development of DCL system, from the view of
pharmacodynamics and storage. Therefore, considering the integrity of the main
transition peak of PSPC, 3.75 mol% of CPZ is a suitable ratio for the preparation of
liposomal formulations in subsequent work.


                                             138


3.4 Conclusion

     The calorimetric investigation by DSC revealed that no interaction occurred
between PSPC MLVs and the CD candidates (β-CD, γ-CD, SGM, HP-β-CD, HP-γ-CD,
SBE-β-CD and SBE-γ-CD), except for SBE-Et-β-CD. The unchanged lamellar distance
and hydrocarbon chain packing determined by X-ray scattering further confirmed the
limited effect of CD on PSPC bilayers, especially at low CD concentrations. Moreover,
HEPC SUVs with and without cholesterol showed good stability in presence of low
concentration of CDs, which is consistent with the results obtained with PSPC MLVs
and provides evidence for the feasibility of DCL formulation. Additionally, a study of
the interaction between CPZ and PSPC bilayers determined that 3.75 mol% of CPZ is
a safe ratio for the stability of the DCL system, considering the amphiphilic property of
CPZ.

4.1 Introduction

     In the treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the standard “7+3 regimen”
(cytarabine for 7 days with daunorubicin or idarubicin for 3 days) is the most commonly
used clinical chemotherapy. However, the severe side effects of treatment and the
limited solutions for older patients have motivated researchers to develop novel agents
for this disease. At present, several small molecules are undergoing investigation,
including clofarabine, sorafenib, midostaurin and crenolanib. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is
widely used as an antipsychotic that is effective in treating schizophrenia and it is well
tolerated. Although most of the medical applications of CPZ are focused on the
treatment of psychological disorders, Hait et al reported a study in 1985 that
investigated the effect of CPZ and chlorpromazine-sulfoxide on the growth of murine
leukemic lymphocytes (L1210 and L5178Y) and human promyelocytic leukemic
granulocytes (HL-60) (Hait et al. 1985). CPZ was found to show higher cytotoxicity
against leukemic cell lines than its sulfoxide derivative, with IC50 values of 8 µM and
100 µM respectively on the HL-60 cell line. This result suggested that CPZ could be
repurposed as a novel way to treat AML.

     Nevertheless, the antipsychotic activity of CPZ depends on its ability to pass
through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and concentrate in the central nervous system.
Therefore, a new strategy needs to be developed for repurposing, to prevent CPZ from
accumulating in the brain but deliver it to the target site, the bone marrow. Liposomes
have been widely used as an efficient nanometric drug delivery system over the past 50
years since their first discovery in 1965 (Bangham et al. 1965), especially since the
1980s when traditional liposomes were first used in a clinical setting (Gabizon et al.
1982). Numerous agents, including hydrophobic, hydrophilic and amphiphilic
molecules, can be encapsulated in the lipid vesicles and further transported into the
circulatory system after different routes of administration.

     In the present study, the hypothesis was that entrapping CPZ in liposomes could
efficiently avoid passage through the BBB and prolong the circulation time in plasma,
                                           143


contributing to the accumulation and uptake of CPZ in the bone marrow. Moreover, the
liposomal formulation provides the possibility of active targeting for the drug, by
coating the surface of liposomes with appropriate monoclonal antibodies or fragments.
However, considering the amphiphilic property of CPZ, drug leakage or rapid release
may occur due to its tendency to locate within the phospholipid bilayer. Therefore, a
versatile drug delivery strategy, the drug-in-CDs-in-liposomes (DCL) system will be
employed to obtain the liposomal formulation. This concept was first proposed by
McCormack and Gregoriadis in 1994 and has applied in virous liposomal carrier cases
(McCormack and Gregoriadis 1994). The DCL system involves 3 interrelated
ingredients: CDs, CPZ and phospholipids, involving complicated interactions between
CD/CPZ, CD/lipid and CPZ/lipid.

     In preliminary work, we performed comprehensive investigations on CD/CPZ
inclusion complexes and as a result selected three cyclodextrins: HP-γ-CD, SBE-β-CD
and Sugammadex (SGM) that showed the highest complexation ratios with CPZ. The
high formation constant of these complexes indicates a strong capability of the CD to
entrap CPZ within its internal cavity, thus drug leakage or rapid release could be
avoided. However, it is also important to determine the influence of CDs on lipids.
Therefore, in a previous study, the effect of various CDs on the integrity of model
liposomes was studied. Most CD types showed no influence on the stability of
liposomes, allowing the preparation of a DCL system and its subsequent biological
evaluation.

     Several methods can be used to prepare drug-loaded liposomes, including thin-
film hydration and ethanol injection. Both these methods are easy to perform, but the
efficiency of drug loading relies heavily on the physicochemical properties of the lipids,
CD and drug. Since the CD/CPZ complex is hydrophilic, it will not be efficiently
incorporated using the methods mentioned above. Therefore, a method more
appropriate for encapsulation of hydrophilic molecules, dehydration-rehydration
vesicles (DRV), has been employed. The DRV method was first developed by Kirby
and Gregoriadis in 1984 (Kirby and Gregoriadis 1984), and has been widely used to
                                           144


prepare liposomal formulations containing various substances, in particular, large
hydrophilic molecules like proteins and nucleic acids. This method has already been
applied to CD complexes by Antimisiaris et al (Antimisiaris et al. 2017).

     In this work, we describe the formulation of liposomes by the DRV method and
its optimization, followed by characterization of the resulting DCL system, including
the vesicle diameter, encapsulation efficiency (EE) of CPZ and phospholipid
concentration in the final formulation. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of CPZ, CDs,
empty liposomes and the DCL systems is evaluated against a panel of leukemia cell
lines.

4.2.2 Methods


4.2.2.1    SUV preparation

     Liposomes composed of HEPC, cholesterol and DSPE-PEG2000 (65:30:5, molar
ratio) were obtained by the film hydration method. Specifically, the components were
dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, v/v) and then organic solvents
were evaporated at room temperature under a gentle stream of nitrogen, followed by
drying under a vacuum overnight in order to completely remove residual organic
solvents.. An appropriate volume of filtered (2 passages through 0.2 μm pore size)
buffer (10 mM HEPES, 145 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) was added to the film to
obtain a total lipid concentration of 30 mM. The lipid suspension subsequently
underwent 10 repeats of 1 min heating at 62 ℃ and 1 min vortexing. SUVs were yielded
by extrusion (LipexTM, Northern Lipids, Canada) through polycarbonate membranes (1
passage through 0.4 μm pore size, 2 passages through 0.2 μm pore size, 10 passages
through 0.1 μm pore size) at 62 ℃.

     Fluorescent liposomes composed of HEPC, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000 and
rhodamine B PE (65:30:5:0.5, molar ratio) were prepared by the same method as above.

4.2.2.2    DRV preparation

     DRV were prepared as previously described (Kirby and Gregoriadis 1984). 2
mL of empty SUVs (30 mM) were first obtained by the extrusion method, an equal
volume of CPZ solution prepared by Milli-Q water (4 mM) was then added and the
mixture was vortexed vigorously for 3 min. The mixture was frozen at -20 ℃ for 3h,
followed by overnight lyophilization (Cosmos, Cryotec). For the rehydration, 0.2 mL
of pre-heated (at 62 ℃) Milli-Q water was added to the freeze-dried lipid pellet that
was then heated at 62 ℃ and vortexed for several cycles until total hydration. After
leaving the MLV dispersion at room temperature for 30 min, 1.8 mL of 10 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.4) was added and the mixture was kept at 62 ℃ for 50 min. To further
homogenize the liposomes (optimized DRV method), an additional extrusion step was

                                         146


performed with two passages through a 0.2 μm polycarbonate membrane. In the
ammonium sulfate gradient DRV preparation protocol, Milli-Q water was replaced by
the same volume of 300 mM ammonium sulfate in the re-hydration step while the other
procedures remain unchanged. These procedures are illustrated in Figure 1 (Fig. 1).

    To prepare the DRV containing CD/CPZ complexes, an equimolar solution
containing 4 mM of CDs and 4 mM of CPZ was first obtained and then mixed well with
the same volume of empty SUVs. Thereafter, freeze-drying, re-hydration and re-
extrusion procedures were performed as above.

     Non-encapsulated CPZ by was removed by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman
Optima L-90K ultracentrifuge equipped with a Type 70:1 Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm
(146682 × g) at 4 ℃ for 6 h. The DRV pellet was resuspended with 1.5 mL HEPES
buffer.

4.2.2.3    Size measurements

     Mean hydrodynamics diameters of the liposome preparations were obtained by
dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Corp.,
Worcestershire, UK). 40 μL sample was diluted into 1.6 mL buffer (10 mM HEPES,
145 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.4) for the measurements at 25 ℃, at a detection angle
of 90°. Size distributions by intensity were recorded and the polydispersity index (PdI)
was also acquired as an indication of the size distribution.

4.2.2.4    Quantification of CPZ by HPLC

     HPLC analysis of CPZ concentration was performed using a Waters 717 Plus
Autosampler HPLC system equipped with Waters 2487 Dual λ Absorbance Detector at
wavelength of 254 nm and 309 nm. A C18 chromatographic column (Waters XTerra®,
5μm, 3.0×150 mm) was used for separation. The mobile phase was comprised of a
mixture of acetonitrile, water and 0.1 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 7 (7:2:1, v:v:v)
and flow rate was set at 0.7 mL/min. The injection volume was 10 μL. A calibration
curve was prepared using CPZ in mobile phase at concentrations between 5 μg/mL and
100 μg/mL.

4.2.2.5    Determination of the encapsulation efficiency of CPZ

     The encapsulation efficiency (EE) of CPZ was determined after removing the
unencapsulated CPZ by ultracentrifugation as described above. 0.1 mL of the dispersed
DRV pellet was mixed with 0.4 mL HPLC mobile phase solution and HPLC was carried
out as above. The CPZ was calculated from the calibration curve and the EE was
obtained by the following equation:

EE (%) = Area DRV /Area initial CPZ × 100                                           (1)

4.2.2.6    Phospholipid assay

     The phospholipid concentration in the liposome preparations was estimated by
measuring phosphatidylcholine using a commercial kit (Phospholipids Colorimetric
Enzymatic Method, BIOLABO, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The reaction scheme of enzymatic colorimetric method is as follows:




     Concretely, 1 mL of the reagent was pipetted into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for
blank, standard and samples to be assayed, followed by addition of 10 μL Milli-Q water,
standard phospholipid solution and sample, respectively. After vigorously mixing, the
tubes were incubated at 37 ℃ for 10 min. The absorbance was recorded at 500 nm
against the blank with Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2 double beam spectrophotometer
(Perkin-Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France). The result was calculated according to the
following equation:

Concentration Sample =Absorbance Sample /Absorbance Standard ×Concentration Standard (2)

4.2.2.7    Cell culture

     Four human leukemic cells lines and a rat kidney fibroblast cell line (NRK) were
used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the different formulations. The             human
promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 was obtained from Dr. Brigitte Bauvois
INSERM U872, Paris. NRK, MOLM13 (AML), OCI-AML (AML) and MV4-11
(myelomonocytic leukemia) cell lines were provided by Lars Herfindal (University of
Bergen, Norway). HL-60, MOLM13 and OCI-AML were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Sigma-Aldrich), while MV4-11 cells were cultured in IMDM medium
(Sigma-Aldrich) and NRK cells in DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich). All media were

                                          149


supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco® by Life TechnologiesTM), 1%
penicillin streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich).
Cells were maintained in humidified incubator at 37 ℃ with 5% CO2.


     Mild trypsin treatment (0.33 mg/mL trypsin for 5 min at 37 ℃) was performed
when NRK cells reached 80% confluence, followed by centrifugation at 160g for 4 min
and reseeding in fresh medium (Ibrahim et al. 2019).


4.2.2.8    Cytotoxicity evaluation

     The cytotoxicity against HL-60 was evaluated by MTS metabolism. Briefly,
25000 cells in 50 μL medium per well were seeded in 96-well plates (TPP®, Swiss) and
incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 ℃. 4 h later, 50 μL medium
containing different concentration of CPZ, CDs, empty liposomes, liposomes
containing CPZ and liposomes containing CD/CPZ complexes were added. The plates
were incubated for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h. Cell viability was assessed by CellTiter 96®
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, France). Briefly, 25 μL of
MTS reagent was added to each well and the plates were incubated for a further 2 or 4
h, after which the optical density (OD) was measured with a high-pass filter at 490 nm
with ELISA plate reader (LT-5000 MS, Labtech).

     The cytotoxicity towards MOLM13, OCI-AML and MV4-11 was assessed by a
similar method involving the metabolism of WST-1. 50 μL medium containing
different concentration of drugs was first added in the wells of 96-well plate, followed
by the seeding of cells in 50 μL medium (35000 cells per well for 24 h incubation and
10000 cells for 72 h). After incubating the plate for 24 h or 72 h, 10 μL WST-1 reagent
was added to each well and the plate was incubated for another 2 h. The OD was
measured by plate reader (TECAN Infinite M200 Pro) at 450 nm.

     For the NRK cells, 5000 cells in 100 μL medium per well were seeded in 96-well
plates and incubated at 37 ℃ for 24 h. Different concentrations of drugs diluted in the
medium was added to the cells and afterwards the same WST-1 procedures were

                                          150


conducted. For the washout experiment, 100 μL of NRK cell suspension (10000
cells/mL) per well was seeded in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 ℃ for 24 h before
treatment. After exposing the cells to different liposomal formulations for 24 h, the cells
were washed twice with PBS buffer and fresh medium (100 μL/well) was added. Cells
were incubated for another 48 h and the viability was assayed by WST-1.

     In all cases, wells containing the different dilutions of the substances to be tested
but without cells were used as blanks to correct for any interference due to the
absorbance of the samples.

4.2.2.9    Flow cytometry

     500 μL MOLM13 cell suspension (350000 cells/mL) per well was seeded in 48-
well plates, followed by addition of fluorescent liposomes at defined concentrations
and timepoints. The plate was incubated at 37 ℃ and the experiment was stopped by
washing with PBS buffer for twice. Cells were kept in ice and dark until measured by
flow cytometry with FACS Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, US). The laser
wavelength was 488 nm with a 585/40 nm filter and the fluid flow rate was 66 µL/min.




4.3 Results and discussion

4.3.1 DRV preparation and characterization

4.3.1.1    DRV prepared by the standard method

     Preliminary investigations of the interactions between CPZ and phospholipids by
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated that a reasonable molar ratio of CPZ
to prepare a liposomal formulation with maximal encapsulation in the aqueous core
without disrupting the bilayer is 3.75 %. Thus 1.1 mM of CPZ was used with a total
lipid concentration of 30 mM.

with 1.1 mM CPZ (DRV-1, B), DRV prepared by optimized method with 1.1 mM CPZ (DRV-2, C)
and DRV prepared by optimized method with 5.4 mM CPZ (DRV-3, D).




     Firstly, empty liposomes (HEPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG2000, 65:30:5) were obtained by
extrusion with a diameter of 122 nm (Fig. 3A). DRV-1 was prepared by the standard
method. After rehydration, a distribution with 2 peaks was observed, with diameters of
134 nm and 664 nm, respectively (Fig. 3B). After removing the unencapsulated CPZ
by ultracentrifugation, the main peak of the distribution shifted to 1026 nm. Although
the EE of CPZ was high (28.3%, Table 1), this diameter was not ideal for intravenous
administration. To obtain smaller liposomes for in-vivo application, a re-extrusion
procedure (two passages through 0.2 μm) was added after the rehydration step. The
optimized protocol yielded DRV-2, whose average size decreased to 188 nm as a result
of re-extrusion and expanded slightly to 193 nm after ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3C). For
DRV-2, the diameter fulfilled the requirements for intravenous injection but another
drawback appeared, the low EE (9.8%), which is an important parameter for a drug
                                             152


delivery system. The low EE may not only reduce the therapeutic effect due to
insufficient drug reaching the target tissue but also increase the possibility of side
effects caused by a higher dose of the formulation. Therefore, a higher concentration of
CPZ was used in an attempt to improve the EE.

     Thus, 5.4 mM CPZ was used to prepare DRV-3. The diameters of DRV-3 after re-
extrusion and ultracentrifugation were 189 nm and 208 nm, respectively (Fig. 3D).
Moreover, the EE rose to 18.3%, with an increase of 8.5% compared with DRV-2
(Table 1), suggesting that adopting a higher concentration of CPZ could be an efficient
way to increase the EE, despite the risk of CPZ interacting with the lipid bilayer and
destabilizing the liposomes.

4.3.1.2      DRV prepared by the ammonium sulfate gradient method

     Fixing the concentration of CPZ at 5.4 mM, DRV containing SBE-β-CD/CPZ
complexes (DRV-4) was prepared but a low EE was obtained (9.9%) (Fig. 4A),
indicating that the complexes are not as efficiently encapsulated as the free drug.
Different results have been obtained when comparing the EE of free drug and CD-
associated drug. A higher EE for HP-γ-CD/curcumin MLVs (50%) was found
compared with curcumin MLVs (Dhule et al. 2012). On the contrary, the EE of HP-β-
CD/nifedipine liposomes (21.9%) was lower than those without HP-β-CD (56.2%)

(Skalko 1996). No difference was found between γ-CD/doxorubicin-PEGylated
liposomes (91.1%) and doxorubicin-PEGylated liposomes (96.4%) (Hagiwara et al.
2006). Moreover, the type of CD also has an impact on the EE. For example, Maestrelli
et al reported that the EE of HP-β-CD/ketoprofen MLVs (33.8%) is higher than that of
β-CD/ketoprofen (26.8%) (Maestrelli et al. 2005). Despite a number of related studies,
the mechanism of how CDs affect the EE of DCL system remains unclear.

CD/CPZ complexes (DRV-4, A) and DRV prepared by the ammonium sulphate gradient DRV
method with CPZ (DRV-5, B).




     Since the EE of SBE-β-CD/CPZ was reduced compared with the free drug, to
further optimize the encapsulation, an active loading strategy with an ammonium
sulfate gradient was combined with the standard DRV method. The ammonium sulfate
gradient method was first reported by Gabizon in 1989 (Gabizon et al. 1989). Relying
on the transmembrane gradient of ammonium sulfate, this method is efficient at
entrapping small molecules, especially amphipathic ones, in liposomes. It is worthwhile
to note that the first PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®) approved by FDA in
1995 was produced by ammonium sulfate gradient method. By adopting this strategy
in CPZ encapsulation, the EE increased to 27.4% (DRV-5) compared to the standard
DRV protocol (18.3%) (Fig. 4B). Since Hait reported the IC50 of CPZ for HL-60 cell

line was 8 μM (Hait et al. 1985), the final concentration of CPZ in DRV-5 (1479 μM)
is sufficient for the in-vitro evaluation.

4.3.1.3      DCL liposomal formulation

     The ammonium sulfate gradient DRV method proved to be an efficient strategy to
prepare the DCL liposomal formulation. According to preceding comprehensive
investigations on the physicochemical properties and interaction with CPZ and
phospholipid, HP-γ-CD, SBE-β-CD and SGM were selected for the preparation of the
DCL system because of their high association capacity with CPZ revealed by ITC,
which could reduce the possibility of drug leakage and contribute to delayed release
during the long circulation time after intravenous administration.

     Consequently, DRV containing CPZ alone, HP-γ-CD/CPZ, SBE-β-CD/CPZ and
SGM/CPZ were obtained by the ammonium sulfate gradient method. Despite the
variation of size distribution after re-hydration, these 4 types of DRV showed a slight
increase in the vesicle diameter of the final DRV (202 nm, 206 nm, 217 nm and 260
nm, respectively) (Fig. 5), implying that CDs have an influence on the diameter of
DCL formulation in the order SGM > SBE-β-CD > HP-γ-CD.

CD/CPZ (C) and DRV-SGM/CPZ (D).

     The impact of CDs on the diameter of DCL was also studied by other researchers.
Liposomes encapsulating CD/ketoprofen complexes were prepared by Maestrelli et al.
The diameter of MLVs containing ketoprofen (1.52 μm ± 0.05) is similar to that of
empty ones (1.58 μm ± 0.08), while the size increased significantly in the presence of
β-CD (3.05 μm ± 0.07) and HP-β-CD (3.16 μm ± 0.10) (Maestrelli et al. 2005). Piel et
al prepared MLVs entrapping betamethasone complexed with a series of CD derivatives
(HP-β-CD, HP-γ-CD, Rameb, Crysmeb) at 10 mM and 40 mM, demonstrating a similar
vesicle size for liposomes with and without CDs (Piel et al. 2006). Similarly, no obvious
difference was observed in HP-β-CD/nifedipine SUVs (155 nm) and nifedipine SUVs
(153 nm) (Skalko 1996). In fact, to the best of our knowledge, CDs show no significant
effect on the diameter of DCL system with respect to the empty liposomes in most cases
(Gharib et al. 2015).


                                          156


       Furthermore, an obvious decrease of the EE was observed for the DRV containing
 CD/CPZ complexes (18.3%, 15.6% and 18.2% in presence of HP-γ-CD, SBE-β-CD
 and SGM, respectively) compared to the DRV entrapping CPZ alone (29.5%) (Table
 3). In the ammonium sulfate gradient method, the unionized form of CPZ can cross the
 lipid membrane easily and subsequently undergoes ionization in intraliposomal
 solution and becomes “locked” inside. However, when forming inclusion complexes
 with CDs, only a small amount of CPZ can pass through the liposomal membrane freely,
 thus leading to a low EE in DCL system.

       In fact, the effect of CDs on the EE of DCL system varies in different situations.
 According the study of Piel et al, the EE of betamethasone showed obvious differences
 between CD types (Piel et al. 2006). The dependence of drug EE on the CD
 concentration in a DCL system was investigated by Maestrelli et al, who reported that
 the EE of ketoprofen could reach to the peak value at 10 mM with the increase of HP-
 β-CD/ketoprofen complexes concentration and then declined at lower concentration.
 The decrease of EE was explained by the destabilizing effect of CD at high
 concentration (Maestrelli et al. 2006), while the CDs in our DCL system showed no
 destabilizing effect. Despite the variety of CDs, HP-β-CD has been used to achieve
 higher EE in many cases, due to its high aqueous solubility (Gharib et al. 2015).

4.3.2 In-vitro evaluation of DCL

4.3.2.1     Cytotoxicity of CPZ

     First of all, to confirm that the drug could have an effect on leukemic cells, we
studied the cytotoxicity of CPZ towards the HL-60 cell line after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h
incubation (Fig. 6). A clear concentration-dependent decrease of cell viability was
observed at each time point, demonstrating that CPZ is capable of inhibiting the growth
of the cells. Furthermore, CPZ showed a time-dependent effect. The concentration
inhibiting 50% cell viability (IC50) of CPZ decreased from 27.3 μM after 24 h
incubation, to 21.9 μM and 18.2 μM in the case of 48 h and 72 h incubation, respectively.
This value is higher than that of 8 μM reported by Hait et al using the same cell line
(Hait et al. 1985). Nevertheless, the result justifies the further application of CPZ for
AML treatment. To simplify the in-vitro assessment and compare the results directly,
we selected the 48 h incubation time for the subsequent study with HL60 cells.

4.3.2.2     Cytotoxicity of empty liposomes and CDs

     The cytotoxicity of empty liposomes was also evaluated. Fig. 7A shows that the
cell viability increased slightly with the liposomal concentration, since 125% of control
viability as determined by MTS reduction was observed when the cells were incubated
with 1600 μM liposomes for 48 h, indicating that the liposomes could facilitate the
growth of HL-60.

     Though there is no clear mechanism about the effect of liposomes on AML cell
lines, a possible hypothesis is that an enhancement of de novo synthesis of fatty acids
is necessary for membrane synthesis and therefore for cell proliferation in many tumors,
with a symptom of enhanced lipogenesis (Stefanko et al. 2017; Loew et al. 2019). In
the microenvironment of bone marrow, fatty acids are accumulated, indicating an
increased lipid catabolism of the AML cells. In fact, global proteomic and lipidomic
approaches have demonstrated an increase of lipid metabolism concerning
phosphatidylinositol, sphingolipids, free cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids
in leukemic cells (Stuani et al. 2018). Thus, the incubation of HL-60 cells with empty
liposomes could stimulate the cell proliferation. The absence of any toxic effects of
empty liposomes facilitates the interpretation of results obtained with encapsulated CPZ.

     It was also important to check the cytotoxicity of the CDs used: HP-γ-CD, SBE-
β-CD and SGM, against HL-60 (Fig. 7B). No significant cytotoxicity was observed for
any of the three CDs. These findings are in accordance with many other observations
of the safety of CDs for pharmaceutical applications (Loftsson et al. 2005). Generally,
CDs present no cytotoxicity at the concentrations used in pharmaceutical preparations.
For example, the IC50 of HP-β-CD and ionic β-CDs was found to be higher than 200
mM against Caco-2 cells (Kiss et al. 2010). Although the methylated-β-CD derivatives
are more toxic, most of them have an IC50 higher than 50 mM. In fact, CD complexation
can reduce the toxicity of the drug: chlorzoxazone in complex form with β-CD and HP-
β-CD showed less toxic to normal liver cells than its free form (Tang et al. 2015). As
far as in-vivo toxicity is concerned, the LD50 doses of intravenously administered CD
are quite high: 1.0 g per kg, 0.79 g per kg and 4.0 g per kg for α-, β- and γ-CD
respectively (Davis and Brewster 2004).

4.3.2.3    Cytotoxicity of DCL

     Fig. 8 shows the cytotoxicity of DRV containing CPZ and the different CD/CPZ
complexes (Fig. 8). Since the EE varied among the 4 DRVs, different dilutions were
done to adjust the CPZ concentration to the same level. Free CPZ and the simple

                                          160


liposomal form (CPZ DRV) showed very similar IC50 values of 12.8 μM and 13.3 μM,
respectively. The slightly lower value for CPZ DRV could be attributed to the
promoting effect of empty liposomes compensating for the effect of CPZ or that
encapsulation rendered the CPZ less available to the cells. For the CD DRVs, low
concentrations showed slightly increased viability, compared with the control, and the
IC50 values varied depending on the CD type. The IC50 for HP-γ-CD DRV was 21.1
μM, slightly higher than that of CPZ DRV. In the case of SBE-β-CD DRV, a higher
IC50 was obtained at 33.4 μM. This suggests that CPZ is more strongly retained in the
CD and not able to exert its effect on the cells. Interestingly, no cytotoxicity was
exhibited by SGM DRV, even at a concentration of 100 μM CPZ, indicating that SGM
entrapped CPZ tightly within its hydrophobic cavity and the inclusion complexes
efficiently restricted the release of CPZ. These findings are in accord with the results
acquired in the ITC experiment in which SGM had the highest complex formation
constant with CPZ.

     In brief, the 3 DCL formulations of CPZ showed reduced activity compared with
CPZ alone, which would indicate that the drug was sequestered within the CD to a
greater or lesser extent, which could provide delayed release properties and be an
advantage to maintain an effective concentration of CPZ for a longer time after
intravenous administration. A similar phenomenon was observed by Chen et al, who
found the hydrophobic drug, indomethacin, was released rapidly from the lipid bilayers,
whereas for liposomes containing CD/indomethacin complexes, a slower drug release
was observed (Chen et al. 2007). According to the authors, two routes of drug release
from the DCL system can be envisaged: a) the CD/drug complexes can be released
from the liposomes intact by passing through the lipid bilayers; b) free drug is released
from the interior aqueous phase of liposomes as equilibrium is established between CD
and drug. Therefore, in both situations, the speed of drug release will be affected by the
CD. Furthermore, the type of CD also plays an important role in the drug release for
DCL system, due to their different complexation capabilities. Piel et al reported a
decreasing order of the release rate of betamethasone from DCL formulations:
Crysmeb > HP-γ-CD > Rame b> γ-CD > HP-β-CD (Piel et al. 2006). In addition, the
drug release is also related to the type of liposomes. For example, the release of
ketoprofen could be observed in increasing order ： LUV containing HP-β-
CD/ketoprofen < MLV containing HP-β-CD/ketoprofen < SUV containing HP-β-
CD/ketoprofen, which can be explained by the smaller size of SUV and higher viscosity
of LUV (Maestrelli et al. 2006; Gharib et al. 2015).




4.3.2.4    Cytotoxicity evaluation of DCL on a panel of cell lines

     After the promising initial results of cytotoxicity against the HL-60 cell line, the
effect of the DCL system containing CPZ was evaluated against four further cell lines:
the rat kidney fibroblast line (NRK) as an example of non cancerous cells and 3 AML
cell lines (MOLM13, MV4-11 and OCI-AML). The properties of the preparations used
in this part of the study are listed in Table 4. As before, DRV containing CPZ, HP-γ-

    The EE decreased from 28.9% in DRV with CPZ to approximately 12% in presence of

         The viability of NRK cells after 24 h of exposure to the different formulations is
    shown in Fig. 9A. These “normal” cells are less sensitive to CPZ than HL-60 cells. For
    NRK cells, the CPZ DRV and HP-γ-CD DRV showed a higher inhibiting effect than
    CPZ alone. This difference may be due to a difference in drug release or cellular uptake
    mechanism in the interaction between liposomes and NRK cells. However, a similar
    reduced effect of CPZ was observed in the case of SBE-β-CD DRV as well as no
    cytotoxicity and a slight growth-promoting effect of SGM DRV was observed.

     Three AML cell lines, MOLM13, MV4-11 and OCI-AML, were also investigated
(Fig. 9B, C, D). In general, the results were similar to those observed with HL-60.
Specifically, compared to the free form of CPZ, the liposomal form exhibited reduced
cytotoxicity. For example, in the case of MOLM13, the IC50 of CPZ alone was 12.5
μM, while it was 13.8 μM and 20.5 μM for HP-γ-CD DRV and SBE-β-CD DRV,
respectively. CPZ DRV showed similar cytotoxicity to CPZ alone, and a growth-
promoting effect was also found with SGM DRV, with 154% of viability when the cells
were incubated with liposomes containing 46 μM CPZ. Similar results were obtained
with the MV4-11 and OCI-AML cell lines, confirming the therapeutic potential of CPZ
DCL system for AML treatment and the variations between the different CDs.

     To further investigate the hypothesis that the DCL system allows delayed release
of CPZ, experiments were performed with an incubation time of 72 h. Even with this
longer incubation time, the empty liposomes were not cytotoxic and had a slight
growth-promoting effect on all four cell lines. However, there were some differences
in the cytotoxicity of CPZ (free or liposomal form) compared with the 24 h incubation
(Fig. 10). For example, the cytotoxicity of CPZ-loaded liposomes towards AML cells
was obviously increased after the longer incubation time. Additionally, in terms of
NRK cells, all the liposomal forms of CPZ, CPZ DRV, HP-γ-CD DRV, SBE-β-CD
DRV and SGM DRV, showed a stronger inhibiting effect than CPZ alone.

     According to Torchilin, there are several modes of interaction between liposomes
and cells (Torchilin 2005). The liposomes could release the drug into the extracellular
matrix after which it would enter the cell as free drug or fuse with the cell membrane
and discharge drug into the cell cytoplasm. However, the most common route for the
liposome-cell interaction is endocytosis. Therefore, for NRK cell line, the higher
cytotoxicity of CPZ in the liposomal form could be explained by the latter two
mechanisms, fusion or endocytosis, allowing a better accumulation of drug than when
the drug is given in the free form. Another consideration could be drug stability in the
culture medium during the longer incubation. Encapsulation in liposomes could protect
the drug and allow effective concentrations to be maintained for longer.
                                          166


     Another observation after the 72 h incubation is the cytotoxicity due to SGM DRV,
in contrast to the effects at 24 h. This confirms the complexation capability of SGM
that could be an advantage for avoiding rapid release of CPZ in the plasma, a more
challenging physiological environment for liposomes than cell culture medium.

plus 48 h incubation with fresh medium. The results are mean ±SD of two wells measured by WST-

     Compared to the AML cell lines, we observed a significant increase of the
cytotoxicity of DRV containing CPZ after 72 h incubation with NRK cells, compared
with 24 h. There are several hypothesis for this difference: a) for NRK cells, a sufficient
uptake of DRV occurs at earlier stage but the intracellular release or taking effect of
CPZ needs a longer time; b) the uptake rate of DRV for NRK cells is slower than that
for AML cells; c) NRK cells need a higher dose of CPZ to show cytotoxic effect than
the AML cells. In an attempt to distinguish between these hypotheses, a washout
experiment was carried out. Concretely, after 24 h exposure to liposomal formulations,
the NRK cells were washed and fresh medium was added, followed by another 48-h
incubation. Figure 11 shows that, for all the formulations, a similar inhibiting effect to
that obtained after a simple 24 h incubation was observed. This result suggests that one
of the last two hypotheses (b or c) applies, thereby providing promising evidence that
CPZ and its liposomal formulations are selective towards AML cells.

 4.3.2.5     Cellular uptake of the DCL system

       In addition, the cellular uptake of liposomes by one of the AML lines was
 investigated by flow cytometry. The properties of the fluorescent DRV preparations are
 shown in Table 5. Their fluorescence intensity was determined for various dilutions in
 a microplate reader. As shown in Fig. 12A, the fluorescence intensity was
 concentration-dependent manner for all the liposomal formulations, but the slopes were
 different. Despite a similar content of the fluorescent label, rhodamine B PE in all
 formulations, empty liposomes demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence
 intensity than other DRV. A probable explanation of this phenomenon is fluorescence
 quenching by CPZ. Jiang et al observed that the fluorescence of rhodamine B PE in
 POPC liposomes was quenched in a concentration-dependent way for 0.1mM to 10 mM
 CPZ (Jiang et al. 2017). It is perhaps noteworthy that less quenching was observed with
 DRV containing SGM, which has the strongest affinity for CPZ. This could indicate
 that in these DRV the CPZ remains better associated with the CD and is less available
 to interact with the lipids in the liposome membrane.

Fig. 12. Calibration curve of fluorescent liposomes (A) and cellular uptake in MOLM13 cells
determined by flow cytometry (B). The results are mean ±SD of three repeats.




     Subsequently, uptake by MOLM13 cells was investigated by incubating with 2%
(v/v) of fluorescent liposomes. For all the samples, the relative median fluorescence,
namely the amount of fluorescence associated with the cells, increased with time,
indicating that liposomes accumulated gradually in the cells and that the process was
not saturated at 4 h (Fig. 12B). After 4 h of contact, the liposomes were taken up by
MOLM13 cells in the order: SBE-β-CD DRV > HP-γ-CD DRV > SGM DRV > CPZ
DRV > empty liposomes, with a relative uptake of 27.1%, 14.0%, 13.4%, 3.4% and
2.1%, respectively. This seems to indicate that liposomes containing CDs were more

                                           169


easily absorbed compared with those without CDs. One hypothesis could be the
interaction between CDs and the PEG on the surface of the liposomes, which would
impair the “stealth” effect of DCL system but improve the possibility of liposome-cell
contact, leading to uptake. It would be useful to perform zeta potential measurements
or studies of the complement-activating properties (Coty et al. 2017) of the DRV to
have a better idea of the nature of their surface.

     Another explanation could lie in the cholesterol-extracting effect of CDs, which
has been reported by Kiss et al (Kiss et al. 2010). This could modify the interaction
between liposomes and the cell membrane, inducing an alteration of fusion or
endocytosis. However, this effect is mainly seen with β-CD, in particular methyl β-CD.
Furthermore, our previous studies on the stability of SUV in the presence of CD
indicated that the three CDs chosen to prepare DRV did not interact with cholesterol-
containing membranes.

     CPZ itself is known to be an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, acting at
concentration similar to those employed in this study (10-100 µM) (Wang et al. 1993).
Therefore, if the drug had been able to leak from the DRV it could have reduced the
liposome uptake, and this effect might have been more prominent with DRV-CPZ
because the drug was retained less well in the absence of CDs.

     Furthermore, the uptake results do not correlate well with the cytotoxicity
evaluation above. The observed cytotoxic activity was, in decreasing order: CPZ DRV >
HP-γ-CD DRV > SBE-β-CD DRV > SGM DRV. That is, CPZ DRV demonstrated the
lowest uptake rate but the highest cytotoxicity among the four DRVs. It could be
explained by the strong CPZ-entrapping capability of CDs as revealed by previous ITC
study, meaning that even if the formulations entered the cells, they did not release the
drug. However, given the effect of CPZ on rhodamine fluorescence, it is quite difficult
to interpret the results, because if the encapsulated CPZ were to be released either
outside or inside the cell, the fluorescence of the liposome could cease to be quenched
and no longer correspond to the calibration curve.

                                           170


     As mentioned above, the CDs help to retain drugs in the DCL system. However,
from another point of view, a strong restraining force may block the release of the agent
and impair the final therapeutic effect. Therefore, a balance should be found between
delayed release and effective drug concentration.


4.4 Conclusion

      In this work, a liposomal formulation of CPZ with sufficient encapsulation and
suitable size for IV administration was obtained by the ammonium sulfate gradient
DRV method. An in-vitro evaluation confirmed the inhibiting effect of CPZ on human
leukemia cell lines (HL-60, MOLM13, MV4-11 and OCI-AML), while empty
liposomes and CDs alone had no significant cytotoxicity. CPZ in the liposomal forms
demonstrate a tendency for delayed release, in the order: DRV-SGM/CPZ > DRV-SBE-
β-CD/CPZ > DRV-HP-γ-CD/CPZ > DRV-CPZ, implying that the CD/CPZ inclusion
complexes can persist within the inner water phase of liposomes and further restrict the
release of CPZ. However, the excessively strong entrapping capability of SGM may
impair the therapeutic aim of the drug delivery system to a certain extent. In addition,
CPZ and its liposomal formulations revealed selectivity towards AML cells, and
liposomes containing CDs appeared to be taken up more avidly by MOLM13 cells than
those without CDs.

                                General discussion

     As a typical antipsychotic, CPZ was reported to have inhibiting effect on the
human promyelocytic leukemic granulocytes (HL-60) (Hait et al. 1985). To repurpose
CPZ for the treatment of AML, its passage through the BBB should be prevented, since
the main therapeutic target for AML is the bone marrow (BM). Therefore, liposomes
were used as a drug carrier for CPZ because they do not normally penetrate the BBB.
Moreover, a “stealth” effect of the formulation could be achieved by coating the
liposomal surface with PEG.
     To further avoid the drug leakage caused by the amphiphilic property of CPZ, an
efficient drug delivery system, drug-in-CDs-in-liposomes (DCL) was adopted. The
concept of DCL was first proposed by McCormack and Gregoriadis in 1994 and has
been widely used to delivery numerous drugs (McCormack and Gregoriadis 1994). As
previously discussed, the DCL system is a complicated assembly composed by 3
relatively independent and interrelated ingredients: CD, CPZ and phospholipids,
resulting in interactions between CD/CPZ, CD/phospholipids and CPZ/phospholipids.
The first question to be answered is which of the wide range of CDs available for
pharmaceutical uses (α-CD, β-CD, γ-CD, HP-β-CD, HP-γ-CD, SBE-β-CD, SBE-γ-CD,
SBE-Et-β-CD and SGM).         Therefore, in the preliminary experimental stage, we
carried out an in-depth study on the 3 types of interactions with several physicochemical
methods.
     The ITC investigation revealed that the formation of CD/CPZ complexes varies in
different kinds of CDs. α-CD and most of the β CDs form 1:1 complexes with CPZ,
while the γ CDs mainly form a mixture of 1:1 and 1:2, except SGM, which can directly
form 1:2 complexes with a high formation constant (k1:2 = 6.36×109 ± 2.53×108). 1H
NMR has also confirmed the stoichiometry of SGM/CPZ complexes (1:2). As
mentioned previously, a dynamic equilibrium could be established between the
CD/drug complexes and free molecules of CD and drug in the aqueous medium. This
process could be influenced by several factors, such as the size of cavity of CD, the
hydrophobic properties and ion pairing of the host and guest molecules. In fact, this
                                        175


equilibrium is a balance of driving forces, involving van der Waals interactions,
hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions (Jambhekar and Breen 2016).
Concerning the therapeutic aim of CPZ, the drug release from the complexes should be
considered. Since we require sufficient release of CPZ in the BM after long circulation
in the plasma, a balance needs to be found between the binding and release of CPZ from
the complexes. For example, the high complexation constant of SGM might become a
drawback if CPZ cannot escape easily from the complex at the target site. Indeed, our
in-vitro evaluation has demonstrated that the liposomes containing SGM/CPZ did not
show cytotoxicity towards the AML cells after 24 h incubation whereas those with other
CD/CPZ did. However, it will be discussed in more detail in a later part.
     We observed decreased photostability of CPZ in presence of all the CD candidates.
Generally, CDs show a protective effect towards the photodegradation of included
guests. For example, tretinoin/β-CD complexes demonstrated an obvious increase in
drug stability compared with free tretinoin (Caddeo et al. 2007). However, in a
comprehensive investigation on the photostability of parathion and paraoxon with a
series of CDs, either a photoprotective or an accelerating effect was observed. The
authors explained this by the difference in distance between the catalytic sites of the
host cavities and the reaction centers of the included pesticide molecules (Kamiya and
Nakamura 1995). An interesting study was conducted by Wang et al, who found that
the enhanced degradation of bisphenol Z (1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) cyclohexane
(BPCH) in the presence of β-CD could be attributed to direct photolysis and
photooxidation, by analyzing the photodegradation products of BPCH (Wang et al.
2007). Therefore, we may get a better insight of the photodegradation mechanism of
CPZ by performing on LC-MS study on the solution after photodegradation.
     Secondly, we studied the interaction between CD/phospholipids, both MLVs and
SUVs. We designed our liposomal formulation with a composition of HEPC,
cholesterol and DSPE-PEG2000 (65:30:5, molar% respectively), based on the
encouraging work conducted previously in our laboratory (Sauvage et al.
2016)(Sauvage et al. 2018). PSPC was used as a model phospholipid since it is the main

                                         176


species present in HEPC. The thermotropic behavior of PSPC in presence of CDs
investigated by DSC demonstrated that there is no interaction between PSPC MLVs
and most of the CDs, except SBE-Et-β-CD above 25 mM. A similar phenomenon was
observed by Nishijo and Mizuno, who found that CDs exerted different effects on the
thermotropic properties of DPPC. The different types of interaction were elucidated by
the authors, showing that heptakis (2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin could subtract
DPPC molecules from the lipid bilayer and form soluble complexes, α-CD forms
insoluble complexes also by lipid subtraction, while heptakis (2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-β-
cyclodextrin could penetrate into the matrix of liposomes (Nishijo and Mizuno et al.
1998). These three modes of interaction provide us with clues to explore the exact
interaction mechanism between SBE-Et-β-CD and PSPC in the future, by measuring
the concentration of CD and lipid in the supernatant as described in the literature.
     SAXS experiments were carried out to gain an insight into the impact of CDs on
the lipid lamellar organization. The lamellar distance of pure PSPC at different phases
showed good agreement with other researchers’ work. In the Pβ' and Lα state, lamellar
expansion could be observed when PSPC was in the presence of higher concentrations
(25 mM) of SBE-β-CD, SBE-γ-CD, SGM and especially SBE-Et-β-CD. While at lower
temperature, 25℃ at Lβ' phase, the lamellar distance remained unchanged, indicating
that no interaction between CDs and PSPC occurred in this state. Therefore, the CDs
wouldn’t disrupt PSPC liposomes in the Lβ' phase. According the DSC study, the Tp-
onset (onset of pre-transition) was 38.7°C, suggesting that under physiological
conditions, in-vitro or in-vivo, the PSPC bilayers would remain intact.
     Moreover, the influence of CDs on the hydrocarbon chain packing of PSPC was
studied by WAXS. In contrast to the observations made by SAXS, the packing state of
PSPC acyl chains was found to be barely disturbed by the addition of CDs, even for 50
mM SBE-Et-β-CD. Since the lamellar distance revealed by SAXS consists of two
phases: the aqueous phase and the lipid phase, it could be concluded that the interaction
between CDs and PSPC occurred mainly near the polar head but not in the alkyl chain
region of the lipid lamellae.

                                          177


     The situation will become more complicated in the case of SUVs, since they
consist of HEPC, cholesterol and DSPE-PEG2000. The previously mentioned DSC or X-
ray method cannot provide clear information about the multicomponent mixture chosen
to prepare formulations for the biological experiments. Therefore, turbidimetry, a
simple but effective technique, was used to investigate the stability of SUVs
(HEPC:cholesterol:DSPE-PEG2000, 65:30:5) in the presence of CDs. It was observed
that SUVs showed good integrity in presence of all CDs tested except SBE-Et-β-CD,
which is in accordance with the DSC results on PSPC membranes. It reconfirms the
feasibility of using these CD candidates in the preparation of the DCL formulation.
Additionally, the role of cholesterol in the stability of liposomes were studied, by
investigating the behavior of SUVs (HEPC:DSPE-PEG2000, 95:5) under the same
conditions. Similar results were obtained to those observed with SUVs containing
cholesterol. Although these findings cannot reveal the exact function of cholesterol in
HEPC SUVs, the use of cholesterol as a stabilizer in liposomal formulations has been
widely reported (Briuglia et al. 2015)(Papahadjopoulos et al. 1973)(Kaddah et al. 2018).
Therefore, since it did not increase the susceptibility of liposomes to destabilization by
CDs, cholesterol was retained in the composition of SUVs.
     Another question needs to be answered is that of the interaction between CPZ and
lipid bilayers. Due to the amphiphilic nature of CPZ, interaction was observed from a
low CPZ/PSPC molar ratio. Finally, 3.75 mol% was determined as the suitable
percentage for the liposomal preparation, although the PSPC membranes were not
saturated with 45 mol% of CPZ. It should be noted that that CDs would be expected to
form inclusion complexes with CPZ in the DCL system, and because of this a higher
percentage of CPZ could be used. However, considering that the formulation is
designed to be long-circulating, a relatively conservative choice would be prudent.
     After a comprehensive investigation of the interaction between CD/CPZ and
CD/lipids, liposomes (HEPC:Chol:DSPE-PEG2000, 65:30:5) were prepared by the
dehydration-rehydration vesicles (DRV) method, a strategy proposed by Kirby and
Gregoriadis in 1984 (Kirby and Gregoriadis 1984). However, the low EE of CPZ led

                                           178


us to combine the DRV method with an active loading strategy, ammonium sulfate
gradient, which was developed by Gabizon in 1989 (Gabizon et al. 1989). According
to the ITC study, HP-γ-CD, SBE-β-CD and SGM were selected for the preparation of
DCL system, because of their higher formation constants with CPZ. However, after
obtaining liposomes via the ammonium sulfate gradient DRV method, we observed an
obvious decrease of EE in DRV containing CD/CPZ complexes compared with the
DRV with CPZ alone. According to the mechanism of ammonium sulfate gradient
method (Yingchoncharoen et al. 2016), the “locking” would become less effective for
CD/CPZ inclusion complexes since part of CPZ cannot be ionized, thus leading to
lower EE. A similar phenomenon was reported by Skalko, who found the EE of HP-β-
CD/nifedipine liposomes (21.9%) was lower than those without HP-β-CD (56.2%)
(Skalko 1996). According to Maestrelli, the type of CD has an effect on the EE of DCL
system. For example, the HP-β-CD/ketoprofen MLVs (33.8%) is higher than that of β-
CD/ketoprofen (26.8) (Maestrelli et al. 2005).
     Although the stability of liposomes has been verified by DSC and turbidimetry,
the situation in the DCL system is different. Therefore, in future experiments, it is also
necessary to investigate the stability of the DCL liposomal formulation. Several
methods could be employed for this. For example, the evolution of the diameter of the
DRV after incubation in HEPES buffer for different periods could be determined by
DLS. Another parameter related to the liposomal integrity that is important for the
performance of the formulation is the release of CPZ during the storage, which could
be studied by assaying the concentration of CPZ remaining after different intervals of
dialysis.
     Furthermore, in terms of the physicochemical studies of the DCL system, the
photodegradation of CPZ should also be investigated. We have observed the facilitating
effect of CDs on this process in the case of CD/CPZ complexes, while the situation
remains unclear when CPZ is encapsulated in liposomes as the free or complex form.
It is possible that liposomes might be able to provide a protective screen against light
to some extent, thus less photodegradation of CPZ would be observed. However, we

                                           179


need to conduct experiments to clarify this aspect.
     An in-vitro evaluation of the DCL system was performed. Firstly, the cytotoxicity
of CPZ was studied against HL-60 cells and IC50 of 21.9 μM was obtained, which is
slightly higher than that (8 μM) reported by Hait (Hait et al. 1985). The CDs showed
no cytotoxicity while empty liposomes exhibited a growth-promoting effect towards
the HL-60 cells. A hypothesis to explain this facilitation of growth is the necessity of
de novo synthesis of fatty acids for membrane synthesis, especially for tumor cell
proliferation (Stefanko et al. 2017). Stuani et al provided some evidence for this
hypothesis, by carrying out global proteomic and lipidomic approaches that have
showed an increase of lipid metabolism concerning phosphatidylinositol, sphingolipids,
free cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids in leukemic cells (Stuani et al. 2018).
     Reduced cytotoxicity activity was observed in the DRV containing CD/CPZ
complexes compared with CPZ DRV. It could be explained by the complexation of CPZ
by CD, as already shown by the results in ITC, and provides the possibility of delayed
release. However, the complexation capability of SGM might be too high to release
CPZ efficiently, since no cytotoxicity was observed with the SGM DRV. The effect of
CD type on the drug release from DCL was also reported by Piel et al (Piel et al. 2006).
Moreover, the type of liposomes also influences the release kinetics of DCL. SUVs
containing HP-β-CD/ketoprofen showed a faster drug release rate than its MLV and
LUV form, due to their smaller size (Maestrelli et al. 2006). Therefore, if the release
kinetics of our liposomal formulations need to be tuned for in-vivo use, it would be
possible to modify the release of CPZ by changing the DRV diameter.
     It was also necessary to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of DRV against non-
malignant cells and for this the NRK cell line was chosen, beginning with a 24-h
incubation. Compared with HL-60, the DRV showed a different order of activity against
the “normal” cells, indicating a different route of interaction between liposomes and
NRK cells. However, when other leukemic cell lines were tested, MOLM13, MV4-11
and OCI-AML, the DRV activity was similar with that obtained with HL-60. To study
the possibility of delayed release from the DCL system, we performed a longer contact

                                          180


time, 72 h. An obvious difference was that SGM DRV started to show cytotoxicity
against the four cell lines, with a high IC50. This provides evidence that it would be
possible to avoid release of drug from our DCL liposomal formulation in the circulation
system, and delay it until the accumulation or cellular uptake of liposomes in the bone
marrow. However, as discussed, a high complexation affinity could prevent drug release
in or around the target cells or even make the DCL system as a fatty acid supplier, as
the empty liposomes did, which would promote the growth of tumor cells.
     The DRV showed a significant increase of the cytotoxicity towards NRK cells
when the incubation time was prolonged to 72 h. From the results of the washout
experiment, we can propose two hypotheses for this finding: 1) NRK cells take up DRV
slower than the AML cells; 2) a higher dose of CPZ is needed for NRK cells to show a
toxic effect than the AML cells. Both of these hypotheses suggest that CPZ and its
liposomal formulations are selective towards AML cells, which is promising for the
further in-vivo application of our DCL system.
     Finally, the cellular uptake was studied with fluorescent liposomes loaded with
rhodamine B PE. Empty liposomes showed a much stronger fluorescence intensity than
those containing CPZ, which could be explained by the fluorescence quenching
property of CPZ (Jiang et al. 2017). For MOLM13 cells, liposomes containing CDs
were more easily taken up than those without CDs. This phenomenon could be
explained by several hypotheses. One is the interaction between CDs and the PEG
grafted on the liposomes, which could weaken their “stealth” effect. In this respect,
investigation on the zeta potential or the complement-activating properties (Coty et al.
2017) of the DRV would provide more information. Other hypotheses such as the
cholesterol-extracting effect of CDs or the role of CPZ in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
have also been discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
     A promising perspective in this project is the active targeting of the DCL system.
In the past decade, targeted monoclonal antibodies have facilitated chemotherapy for
cancers. As an exclusive surface marker for leukemic stem cells, CD33 antigen could
be used to optimize our DCL system in the future. In fact, this has been investigated by

                                          181


several researchers (Rothdiener et al. 2010)(Simard and Leroux 2010). For example, Li
et al reported CD33-targeted lipid nanoparticles loaded with GTI-2040, an antisense
oligonucleotide, for AML treatment. They used anti-CD33 scFv as the targeting ligand
and the system showed a significant uptake and a 15-fold reduction in the IC50 of
antileukemic drug Ara-C against Kasumi-1 cells(Li et al. 2015). Another potential
surface marker that could be considered for the targeting of our system is CD123. An
immunoliposome piloted by CD123 antibody has been obtained by Wang and his
colleagues to target to AML cells, with positive results both in-vitro and in-vivo (Wang
et al. 2017). Therefore, these related studies provide us with sufficient choices and
promising possibilities of achieving a CPZ-loaded liposomal formulation for the
treatment of AML.
