Acknowledgements

My doctoral work could be carried out smoothly in France. I would like to thank the
China Scholarship Council (CSC) for their support for my study and life, as well as
Université Paris-Saclay (CNRS UMR 8182) and Ecole Polytechnique (CNRS UMR
9168, Institut Polytechnique de Paris) for providing me a perfect environment to
conduct scientific research.


Unconsciously, I have spent three years in France and will soon be welcoming my
doctoral thesis defense. Three years is so long that I have been able to make many lovely
and warm-hearted friends in France. Three years is also so short that I still want to do
more meaningful projects with my supervisor Prof. Vincent Gandon. No matter in terms
of study or life, the past three years in France have left me so many great memories.
Here, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people who helped and supported
me.


Firstly, I would like to thank Dr. Christophe Bour, who was the key person for me to
get the doctoral position. At the end of 2017, I saw an advertisement for Christophe's
doctoral position in organic chemistry when I accidentally browsed the web. Because I
just started looking for a doctoral position and wanted to develop in organic synthesis,
I didn't hesitate to send my resume to Christophe, even though my graduate major is
physical chemistry. Not surprisingly, I did not pass the interview without experience in
organic synthesis. Fortunately, Christophe introduced my background in physical
organic chemistry to Prof. Vincent Gandon. A few days later, Christophe offered me
another doctoral project, which is my supervisor Vincent’s project. Therefore, I would
like to sincerely thank Christophe, because of him I got this unexpected offer.


Secondly, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Vincent
Gandon, who helped me the most during my doctoral career. Before praising my
supervisor, I want to tell an interesting story. When I told my Chinese colleague Jiaxin

                                                                                       1


that I had received the scholarship from CSC, he went to tell my future supervisor. The
interesting thing is that my supervisor couldn't remember at all that he recruited me as
a doctoral student. At that moment, he might be thinking: Who is this guy? Every time
my colleague talked to me about this story, we all laughed loudly. In fact, Vincent is a
very careful and patient person at work and I can feel he loves chemistry. Every time I
have a question to ask him in his office, he can explain it to me in detail. Even if he is
not in the office sometimes, he will discuss with me according to our appointment, and
he has never missed one. He once told me, "You can ask me anything you want to learn
and I will teach you everything I know." These words have stuck with me to this day. I
have been deeply influenced by his abundant academic knowledge and unique
personality. I am very grateful that he taught me a lot in chemistry, especially for setting
me a good example. Therefore, I am very grateful to my supervisor Prof. Vincent
Gandon.


Next, I would like to sincerely thank Dr. Etienne Derat (Sorbonne Université), Dr.
Gilles Frison (Sorbonne Université), Prof. Isabelle Chataigner (Université Rouen
Normandie) and Dr. Guillaume Vincent (Université Paris-Saclay) for being the jury
members of my thesis defense and reviewing my work.


And, I would also like to thank my colleagues who work together with me at ECM:
Emilie Kolodziej, Dr. Emmanuelle Schulz, Prof. Giang Vo-Thanh, Dr. David Lebœuf,

Wang, Peng Pan, Sunbing Huang, Dayi Liu, Chanjuan Zhang, Qi Zhang, Weipeng Zeng
and others.


Last but not least, I would like to sincerely thank my family: my mom, dad, sisters, and
brothers. I am so lucky to live in a loving family. I am grateful to my parents for raising
us and supporting us to receive a good education. I would also like to thank my
girlfriend Qiuyin Zhu for encouraging and supporting me during my doctoral career.
Thank you and love you all.

General Introduction

Main-group metal catalysis is an effective strategy to achieve novel reactivity and
selectivity in various synthetic organic reactions, especially in carbon-carbon bond
forming reactions. With more than a hundred years of efforts, this field is now an
essential aspect of modern synthetic organic chemistry and has a wide range of
applications in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, materials, and natural products.
Among them, gallium and calcium complexes as Lewis acidic catalysts have been well
recognized for their high reactivity towards the activation of benzenes, enynes,
hydroxyl groups, etc.


The development of Lewis acidic catalytic reactions often relies on a thorough
understanding of the catalyst model, reaction mechanism, reactivity, selectivity and
factors controlling the rate. Ancillary ligands and counterions, exemplified by NTf2- or
PF6-, largely contribute to delicately control the reactivity and selectivity of main-group
metal catalyzed processes, such as the calcium(II)-catalyzed coupling of alcohols with
vinylboronic acids. This is because the modifications of the ligand structure can often
lead to a significant impact on steric and electronic properties, and consequently on the
the reaction outcomes. However, it remains challenging to thoroughly understand
catalyst models only from pure chemical intuition, given the complexity of ligand
effects, as multiple factors (electron withdrawing ability, steric bulkiness, solubility,
etc.) may all contribute to a Lewis acid catalyzed reaction. Experimental studies of
reaction mechanisms and ligand effects are also often challenging due to the difficulty
to characterize the short-living reactive organometallic intermediates.


Computational analysis has been widely applied to almost all types of Lewis acid-
catalyzed carbon-carbon forming reactions to predict the most favorable reaction
pathway, to understand the effects of ligands and substituents, and to provide plausible
rationales to design new catalysts. Although reaction mechanisms of most Lewis acid
catalyzed reactions, as exemplified by the classical GaCl3-mediated Friedel-Crafts

                                                                                         7

alkylation of benzene, are well accepted, some mechanistic details like the role of
superelectrophilic homodimers and the existence of textbook intermediates such as
Wheland-type σ-complexes remains unclear. In the last few decades, density functional
theory (DFT) calculations have developed into an important tool for studying the
mechanism of Lewis acid catalyzed reactions. The generally accepted procedure to
explore the reaction mechanism involves optimization of reaction substrates and
calculation of the energies of intermediates and transition states along a plausible
reaction coordinate to construct an energy profile. Conventionally, the proposed
reaction mechanism is constructed by well-defined elementary steps containing various
competing chemo-, regio-, and enantio-isomeric reaction pathways. The rate- and
selectivity-determining steps can be determined by comparing computed Gibbs free
energies of each competing pathways. The identified key intermediates and transition
states are then further analyzed to provide chemically meaningful interpretation of
ligand-controlled reactivity and selectivity in complicated reaction systems and to build
predictive models for well-reasoned catalyst design.


In this doctoral thesis, I present computational studies on the gallium(III)-catalyzed
methylation of benzene (Chapter 2), the gallium(III)-catalyzed skeletal reorganization
of enynes (Chapter 3) and the calcium(II)-catalyzed coupling reactions (Chapter 4). The
overall objectives of my studies include investigation of reaction mechanisms, analysis
of ligand effects and construction of predictive models.

Chloride-Mediated Methylation of Benzene: A Theoretical Study


Although the Friedel-Crafts reaction has been discovered more than a 140 years ago,
its reaction mechanism is still a matter of debate. DeHaan, Brown and others have
perfomed a great number of kinetic studies in this field. They reported that the rate law
of the GaCl3-catalyzed methylation of benzene is -d[C6H6]/dt = k[C6H6][GaCl3]2.
Regarding the second order of GaCl3, the topic of debate is about the precise role of the

ion pair or dual activation)? These are the kind of questions we have tried to address
using computational techniques.


A second topic of debate is about the stepwise or concerted nature of the Friedel-Crafts
reaction. Is this a stepwise process through a Wheland-type σ-complex as shown in any
textbook? or it is a concerted reaction? This is one of the topics that keeps being
discussed and to which we have tried to make a contribution.


All of the above issues are good reasons to use DFT calculations to further clarify the
specific reaction mechanisms.




Excerpt from Chapter 3. Alkynophilicity of Group 13 MX3 Salts: A Theoretical
Study


The cycloisomerization of 1,n-enynes is a well-established strategy to rapidly increase
the molecular complexity from simple substrates and provide useful synthons. As early
as 2002, Chatani et al. reported the GaCl3-catalyzed skeletal reorganization of enynes
to 1-vinylcycloalkenes. The reaction mechanism that has been proposed when GaCl3 is
used as catalyst is actually not much different from the one that has been well-
established with Au(I) complexes. However, for alkynophilicity, the typical features of
late-transition metal gold(I) complex cannot be used to explain the properties of the
main-group metal derived GaCl3 salt. This raises the question of what makes a simple
species such as GaCl3 a good alkynophilic π-Lewis acid in comparison to late-
transition-metal complexes such as LAu(I)+ species, or even compared to BCl3, AlCl3,

Excerpt from Chapter 4. DFT Analysis into the Calcium(II)-Catalyzed Coupling of
Alcohols with Vinylboronic Acids: Cooperativity of Two Different Lewis Acids and
Counterion Effects


Our group has developed the calcium-catalyzed coupling of alcohols with vinylboronic
acids in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Allyl-, benzyl- and propargyl alcohols, as well as
N,O-acetals were evaluated as reaction substrates. In the calcium-catalyzed alkylation
reaction with allyl alcohol as the substrate, the yield decreases in the presence of the
nBu4NPF6 ammonium salt. On the other hand, no product was observed when N,O-
acetals were used as substrates in the absence of this additive. In order to deeply
understand the mechanism of these two reactions and the features controlling the
reactivity, we have studied four possible reaction pathways: a. The metal activates the
hydroxyl group of the substrate. b. The boronic acid activates the hydroxyl group. c.
The calcium and the boron Lewis acid synergistically activate the hydroxyl group. d.
The calcium salt activates the boronic acid, which in turn activates the hydroxyl group
(superelectrophilic activation). Based on the above reaction pathways, we have carried
out theoretical calculations to get a better insight into a mechanism involving two
different main group metals, both likely acting as Lewis acids, and sometimes an
ammonium salt as activator.

1.1.     The Friedel-Crafts Alkylation: More Complex than It
Looks

In 1877, Friedel and Crafts reported the alkylation and acylation of aromatic
compounds.1 The classical mechanistic interpretations of such electrophilic aromatic
substitutions mainly involve two steps (Scheme 1.1): a. The electrophile R is attacked
by the electron-rich benzene, causing benzene to lose its aromaticity to form a Wheland
intermediate (also refered to as σ-complex). b. Deprotonation occurs from the Wheland
intermediate to give an aromatic alkylation (or acylation) product.




          Scheme 1.1. The classical mechanism of the Friedel-Crafts reaction.


As discussed above, this classical view eludes several features regarding the exact
nature of the active species and the possibility of having the two events within a single
transition state rather than two.

MX3 salts of the group 13 metals or of the transition metal series such as AlCl3, GaCl3,
FeCl3, etc, are typical catalysts of the Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. AlCl3 and
GaCl3 exit as M2Cl6 homodimers in the solid state and in weakly coordinating solvent
(Scheme 1.2). This point will be developed in Chapter 2. While this feature has been
usually ignored in theoretical studies on “MX3”-catalyzed reactions, a scrutiny of the
old literature reveals that it cannot be put aside.

Herbert C. Brown is a recognized figure in the kinetic study of Friedel-Crafts reaction.
In one of his multiple 1950-1960 reports about this reaction,2 the observation of the
second-order rate dependence of GaCl3 in the methylation of benzene in excess methyl
chloride suggested an activation mode based on homodimers of general formula Ga2Cl6
(Scheme 1.3, I), but their nature, molecular adduct or ion pair, could not be established.
Thus, they proposed two transition state models, namely the activation by the Ga2Cl6
molecular adduct and the activation by the GaCl2+GaCl4- ion pair (Scheme 1.3, II). In
each case, additional coordination by MeCl, present in large excess, was suggested.

Although the proposed transition states can well explain why GaCl3 follows a second-
order rate law, the preferred activation model requires further research and this
relatively unexplored field has aroused our interest (see Chapter 2). The importance of
dimeric forms of Al and Ga trichlorides in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions
has only been partially studied. Suvorov et al. studied the monomeric and dimeric forms
of metal halides in the protonation of arenes by HCl through theoretical calculations in
2004 and 2005. The calculation results show that for both metals Al and Ga, the
formation of C6H7+·M2Cl7- ion pairs (dimeric form) is more favorable than C6H7+·MCl4-
(monomeric form) in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions (Scheme 1.4).3,4

Although the theoretical studies suggest that homodimers of metal halides can
participate in electrophilic aromatic substitutions, 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 there remains a lack of
experiments validating the fact that dimers may be active catalysts and dominate the
reaction. There is yet an experimental validation that homodimers are the active species
in another category of reactions: the carbonyl-olefin metathesis. In 2019, Schindler and

As early as the 1960s, “superelectrophiles” were described as “highly desirable”
stronger Lewis acids that can be generated by the inherent tendency of Lewis acids to
associate.2,9,10 As shown in Scheme 1.5, singly bridged dimers 3 can be obtained by
the combination of two individual Lewis acids 2, but, unlike the doubly bridged dimers
of type 1, they retain an open coordination site. The electron-withdrawing ability of the
coordinated MX3 unit should potentialize the “Lewis acidity” of this vacant orbital.
Ultimately, the polarization induced by this coordinated MX3 unit could lead to the
abstraction of the X atom forming ion pairs 4 with high activity. Both singly bridged
dimers 3 and ion pairs 4 belong to the family of superelectrophiles as
defined by Olah.11

formed by the coordination of a single FeCl3 molecule with aliphatic ketones is a
catalyst resting state, a single FeCl3 is not strong enough to activate the substrate and
trigger a carbonyl-olefin metathesis reaction (Scheme 1.6, II). However, by increasing
the catalyst loading, that is, from 5 mol% FeCl3 to 10 mol% FeCl3, the amount of
desired carbonyl-olefin metathesis product Pro1 can be significantly increased.
Therefore, it is particularly important to clarify the model of activated catalyst. The
authors conducted a kinetic study on the carbonyl-olefin metathesis of aliphatic ketones
which revealed a zero-order dependence in substrate and second-order kinetics in FeCl3
(nomalized order in FeCl3: 2.0), implying that a different mode of Lewis acid activation
is operative for the carbonyl-olefin metathesis of aliphatic ketones. According to
previous literature and kinetic studies, they believe that the activated catalyst is a single-
bridge dimer or an ion pair. In order to further clarify the structure of the active catalyst,
infrared spectroscopy was used to relate Lewis acid-carbonyl activation to Lewis acid
strength based on change in absorption frequency. When the ketone A is treated with
an equimolar amount of FeCl3, a new signal with an absorption frequency of 1642 cm-
1
    was observed, which is consistent with the complex B formed by the coordination of
a single FeCl3 to A. The addition of the second equivalent of FeCl3 resulted in the third
signal, the absorption frequency of which was lowered to 1615 cm−1, indicating that
stronger Lewis acid increased the carbonyl activation of A. Since both the single
bridged FeCl3 dimer and the corresponding ion pair can reduce the carbonyl absorption
frequencies, which is consistent with the results of IR calculations, the existence of the
single bridged FeCl3 dimer or the corresponding ion pair was proved. In a second step,
Raman spectroscopy was used to verify the presence of FeCl4- signals, so as to check
whether there is an ion pair [FeCl2]+[FeCl4]- or not. Experiments based on Raman
spectroscopy show that when FeCl3 was added to aliphatic ketone A in dichloroethane
(DCE), FeCl4− (330 cm−1) was not formed, which indicates that the ion pair
[FeCl2]+[FeCl4]- does not exist. In summary, the superelectrophile homo-dimer Fe2Cl6
is the active catalyst for this reaction. Based on the above studies and on the support of
DFT computations, a reaction mechanism involving Fe2Cl6 as the Lewis acid

acidic species: AlCl3 (a), AgSbF6 (b), the heterobimetallic ion pair [AlCl2]+[SbF6]- (c),
or AlCl2F (d) and SbF5 (e) formed from the ion pair (Scheme 1.1.7, I). Therefore, it is
necessary to confirm which Lewis acid is the active catalyst. Experiments show that the
conversion of aryl ketone H with a catalytic amount of AlCl3 does not produce the
desired metathesis product Pro3 (entry 1). Similarly, a catalytic amount of AgSbF6
cannot promote the carbonyl-olefin metathesis reaction (entry 2). In contrast, the
optimal reaction conditions using AlCl3 (10 mol%) and AgSbF6 (10 mol%) provided
the desired product Pro3 in 99% yield (entry 3). In addition, the formation of a white
solid was observed, which was identified as AgCl by X-ray powder diffraction.
Similarly, the use of AlCl3 (10 mol%) and AgF (10 mol%) did also lead to the formation
of AgCl, indicating that AlCl2F is formed under these conditions. However, no
formation of the desired metathesis product was observed (entry 4). Lastly, when SbF5
(10 mol%) was used for the reaction, although the desired metathesis product Pro3 was
observed, the yield was reduced by 41% (entry 5).


Additionally, they could quantitatively and qualitatively support the formation of AgCl
during the conversion process (Scheme 1.7, II). The weight of AgCl recovered was
found to be consistent with the calculated weight of AgCl (expected: 1.4 mg, obtained:
1.5 mg). Overall, these results indicate that [AlCl2]+[SbF6]- is the catalytically active
species under the optimal conditions for carbonyl-olefin ring-closing metathesis
towards medium sized rings.

There is another feature of Friedel-Crafts reaction that caught our attention. Whether
the Wheland-type σ-complex is involved in the electrophilic aromatic substitution
mechanism has been a recent hot topic of discussion. In fact, the classical interpretations
of electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanisms via Wheland-type σ-complex have
been refuted several times, both in the presence or absence of a catalyst. Contrary to
traditional interpretations, no σ-complex intermediate was found along the direct
substitution reaction pathway. We have listed some representative computed
mechanism examples with SO3, Br2, Cl2 and alkynes as electrophiles in which

1.1.2.1. SO3 as electrophile


The computational study of the electrophilic aromatic sulfonation with SO3 has been
reported by Schleyer and co-workers (Scheme 1.10).15 Such a reaction requires no
catalyst. The potential energy surfaces of a single SO3 and two SO3 molecules as
electrophiles have been calculated. The computational results show that the
electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism with a single SO3 molecule is concerted
in the gas phase or in non-complexing solvents (such as CCl4 or CFCl3), rather than
involving a σ-complex. However, the activation energy is high, while the activation

energy using two SO3 molecules is 12-20 kcal/mol lower, which is consistent with the

experimental kinetics (second-order in SO3). The IRC analysis showed that the
expected σ-complex is not a stationary point and so there is a direct collapse to the
product. Thus, the mechanism of electrophilic aromatic sulfonation with two SO3
molecules was also found concerted.


It is worth noting that in solvents with higher polarity (complexing solvents), such as
CH3NO2, Wheland-type σ-intermediates could be optimized. Although the reaction has
to overcome the association energy of the complexing solvent, it is consistent with the
experimental kinetics, that is, in CH3NO2, the reaction of two SO3 molecules is still
more favorable than the reaction of a single SO3 molecule.

by Br2 without a catalyst.16 The focus of this article was to compare the mechanism of
the addition-elimination and the concerted substitution by Br2 of benzene and other
arenes. Although substitution products may be formed more rapidly via stepwise
addition-elimination pathways than by concerted substitution pathways, the
computational results clearly show that the substitution reaction in the gas phase or the
nonpolar solvent CCl4 is a concerted process and does not involve a Wheland type
intermediate (Scheme 1.11). This again refutes the classic explanation of electrophilic
aromatic substitution reaction, which involves Wheland type σ-complex.

In this theoretical investigation, Schleyer and co-workers reported the mechanism of
arene chlorination in the nonpolar solvent CCl4 (Scheme 1.12).17 It not only evaluated
two competing mechanisms, namely addition-elimination and direct substitution, but
also the effect of HCl as catalyst on the mechanism. The Gibbs free energies show that
the barriers of addition-elimination and direct substitution mechanisms are very close

(the latter being slightly higher than the former), and the catalyst HCl can greatly reduce
the energy barriers of the two mechanisms. In the presence or absence of catalyst (HCl),
the Wheland type σ-complex was not observed in the direct substitution mechanism,
which means a concerted process. This was also supported by Vrček and co-worker.7

1.1.2.4. Alkynes as electrophiles

In addition to SO3, Br2 and Cl2, alkynes have also been reported as potent electrophiles.
In 2015, our group reported the mechanism of Ga(III)-catalyzed hydroarylation of
arenynes in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) as the solvent.8 In this mechanism, the calculated
results show that the hydroarylation proceeds via a concerted mechanism, and no
Wheland-type intermediate was obtained (Scheme 1.13).

Based on the above examples, it seems that the Friedel-Crafts reaction has no causal
relationship with the type of electrophile or the presence or absence of catalyst, but it
could be related to the polarity of the solvent. When the solvent has a low polarity and
a low complexing ability, the Wheland-type σ-complex might not be a stable
intermediate and collapses during IRCs.


1.1.3. The Role of the Catalyst Beyond the Generation of the

Electrophile

As we know, the role of catalysts in the electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism
is not only the generation of the electrophile, but also to assist the deprotonation. In
addition, Kim and co-workers proposed a third role that is the activation of the aromatic
nucleophile, which seems counterintuitive. 18 Their theoretical pieces of evidence
suggest that the Lewis acid AlCl3 and the aromatic substrate C6H6 can form the
remarkably stable adduct AlCl3·C6H6 (Scheme 1.14, I). Although such a combination
will lose the nodal plane of benzene, the loss of aromaticity can be prevented by back-

donation from Cl 3p orbital to the benzene highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).
Therefore, Kim et al. provide us with a new idea to explore (Scheme 1.14, II). In this
view, the benzene nucleophile is activated by coordination. This should decrease its
electron density and therefore its nucleophilicity, however, the Cl back-donation
enhances the negative charge of the carbon bound to Al, which supposedly increases its
nucleophilicity.

before 2002 involved late-transition-metal complexes, especially gold and platinum. In

eq 2: Using 1,7-enyne K as substrate, the tricyclic compound Pro6 containing a
cyclobutene ring was obtained with a yield of 79% after 2 h at 40 °C. This reaction
indicates that cyclobutene may be involved in the skeletal reorganization of enynes,
which is a very important information for understanding the reaction mechanism.
Chatani et al. proposed the following mechanism (Scheme 1.17, II): First, the enyne 5
forms a vinyl carbocation 6 when the alkyne moiety is coordinated with GaCl3. The
nucleophilic attack of the alkene moiety generates the nonclassical carbocation 7 or
other isomers (7' or 7"). The latter is then transformed into the η1-cyclobutene complex
8. The elimination of GaCl3 leads to strained cyclobutene 9. Finally, cyclobutene 9
undergoes 4π ring opening to provide 1-vinylcyclopentene 10, which is obtained in a
stereospecific manner.


The skeletal reorganization of enynes is often considered to be the territory of late-
transition metals, especially gold and platinum. One of the reason apart from the
softness of such metals, which makes them ready to activate soft functionalities such
as alkynes, is the ease by which transition metals form carbenoid intermediates by π
back-donation. Since back-donation is not possible with gallium or other main group
metals, it seems relevant to study the mechanism of GaCl3-catalyzed skeletal
reorganization of enynes to rationalize why the same result can be obtained nonetheless.
The general mechanism of metal-catalyzed skeletal reorganization of 1,6-enynes is
shown in Scheme 1.18. One common cycloisomerization pathway is the skeletal
reorganization of 1,6-enyne towards 1-vinylcyclopentenes. Specific examples will be
discussed later.

The alkynophilicity of gold(I) complexes has been confirmed to be related to the
relativistic effects and the ability of the soft polarizable gold atom to stabilize
nonclassical carbocations by back-donation, 22 , 23 but these typical features of late-
transition metals are not suitable to explain the alkynophilicity of main-group-based
species. Therefore, compared with the late transition metal complexes LAu(I)+, and
even compared with BCl3, AlCl3, or Ga(OTf)3 that cannot be used as catalysts for enyne
cycloisomerization, what makes GaCl3 or InCl3 becoming a good alkynophilic π-Lewis
acid is an issue we need to address. Whether there is specific activation of the substrate,
such as superelectrophilic activation, is also our focus (see Chapter 3).

of 1,6-enynes into 1-vinylcyclopentenes (Scheme 1.19).

Although the Pd(II)-catalyzed reaction reported by Trost et al. is very attractive, it
appears highly selective only when the substrate has a terminal olefinic moiety. This
limitation reduces the utility of this novel skeletal reorganization reaction. The first
example of the Ru(II)-catalyzed skeletal reorganization of 1,6-enynes to 1-

of the metal catalyst with the alkyne forms a (η2-alkyne)-metal complex 16, which
subsequently forms the metal cyclopropyl carbene complex 17 (via 5-exo-dig
cyclization) or 22 (via 6-endo-dig cyclization). The skeletal rearrangement of enynes
can be carried out through intermediate 17 (or resonance structure 17') to form
conjugated dienes 18 (via bond a cleavage) and 19 (via bond b cleavage). Alternatively,
when a nucleophile of type R'OH (alcohols or water) is present, R’OH will attack 17 to
give alkoxy- or hydroxycyclization products 20 and 21. When Z = O or NTs in the
substrate, the product 23 derived from intermediate 22 is found in the product, and this
process is produced by the shift of the β-hydrogen (M = PtCl231, PtCl432). In addition,
the resonance structure 22' of metal cyclopropyl carbene complex 22 can lead to 24.
Since [Au(PPh3)]+ cannot coordinate with alkenes and alkynes simultaneously, 33
Alder-ene cycloisomerization cannot compete, and the cyclization can only be carried
out through 16-type complexes.

Next, they used [Au(PH3)]+ as the active catalyst and (E)-6-octene-1-yne as a model
substrate to perform DFT calculations ( Scheme 1.22, III). The calculation results show
that when [Au(PH3)]+ is coordinated to the C-C triple bond of (E)-6-octene-1-yne, a
highly polarized (η1-alkyne)-gold complex 25 is formed, which shows obvious electron
deficiency at C2. Complex 25 can easily react with intramolecular alkene through exo-
cyclization. The activation energy of this process is very small and only 0.1 kcal/mol
(TS-exo) is needed to obtain intermediate 26. The C-C bond of cyclopropane
conjugated with carbene in complex 26 has a particularly long bond length (1.728 Å).
Therefore, this complex 26 can also be similar to the resonance structure 26' (a gold(I)-
stabilized homoallylic carbocation). The concept of alkynophilicity was first proposed,
that is, to evaluate the ability of a Lewis acid to promote the skeletal rearrangement (or
alkoxy cyclization) of enynes through highly polarized (η1-alkynes)-metal complexes,
thereby producing stable homoallylic carbocations (Scheme 1.22, IV). The activation
energy of the 6-endo-dig process to produce the carbene is 6.1 kcal/mol (TS-endo),
which is 6 kcal/mol higher than the activation energy of the 5-exo-dig process.
Therefore, for (E)-6-octene-1-yne related substrates, the exo-cyclization reaction
should be favored with gold(I) catalysts.


For comparison, they used [Pt(H2O)Cl2] as the catalyst. The calculation results show
that the activation energy of the 5-exo-dig process and the 6-endo-dig process are 10.3
and 11.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This is consistent with the conclusion that the gold(I)
complex is more active.

The possible mechanism of InCl3-catalyzd skeletal reorganization of enynes (type I and
type II’) is shown in Scheme 1.23, II. The electrophilic interaction of InCl3 with alkyne
moiety gives nonclassical carbocation 29, followed by the formation of cyclobutane
ring 30 (when R = H). From 29 to 30, the stereochemical retention of the terminal
olefinic carbon is consistent with the stereospecificity observed. Next, 30 undergoes
electrocyclic ring-opening to give type I product (31). When R is an alkyl group, the
cation can be stabilized by R group resulting in 32 from 29. Then, 32 is transformed
into 33, which undergoes ring-opening to obtain type II’ product (35).

gold that are linked to its relativistic effects cannot be invoked, nor back-donation that
is effective with Pd or Ru, and yet simple salts such as GaCl3 or InCl3 are excellent -
Lewis acids. Our work shown in Chapter 3 aims at clarifying this issue.

1.3.1. Introduction

The reactivity of calcium(II) compounds can be roughly understood from their two
moieties: a. As a member of alkali metal compounds, it is highly ionic character due to
its low electronegativity. Therefore, calcium endows its counterion with high
nucleophilicity and strong basicity. b. The calcium center itself is similar to the metal
center of a typical Group 3 compound with Lewis acidity (Sc, Y, Ln).38

acids in 2015 and 2017 respectively (Scheme 1.25).39,40 This alkenylation reaction is
effective for allyl, benzyl and propargyl alcohols (Scheme 1.25, I) and N,O-acetals
(Scheme 1.25, II). As shown in Scheme 1.25, the positive effect of ammonium salt
with N,O-acetal P was obvious, that is, a better yield was obtained in the absence of
allyl alcohol N. On the contrary, in the presence of allyl alcohol N, the same additive
(nBu4NPF6) did not give a better yield. The fact that different catalytic systems
(Ca(NTf2)2 and Ca(NTf2)(PF6), see below) lead to different yields has attracted our
attention. Besides, the proposed mechanism of the calcium-catalyzed alkenylation
reaction of allylbenzyl alcohol N and (E)-styrylboronic acid O reported by our group
does not suggest a SN1 reaction, but rather a SN2' process. Furthermore, the mechanism
by which calcium catalyzes the alkenylation reaction of N-acyliminium P and
vinylboronic acid O is not yet clear. In our original proposal, both Ca and B are bond
to the same oxygen of the alcohol substrate. While both are Lewis acids, other
association might also be considered, such as the coordination of Ca to the oxygen of
the B(OH)2 moiety. In such case, this would result in a heterobimetallic
superelectrophile. Thus, a thorough analysis of the species present in solution, including
the counterion, which play an obvious role here, will be presented.

four coordination sites of the metal.

NMR spectrum (not shown in their paper and SI). The 31P NMR and 19F NMR spectra
of the 1:1 mixture of Ca(NTf2)2 and nBu4NPF6 did not show any of the above PF6-
signals. The 31P NMR spectrum has no signal (not shown again), while the 19F NMR
spectrum shows a new singlet at 79.10 ppm, which corresponds very accurately to the
signal of the CF3 moiety of nBu4NNTf2. Therefore, based on the above spectral
observation, the 1:1 mixture of Ca(NTf2)2 and nBu4NPF6 has formed Ca(NTf2)(PF6)

In order to better understand the difference between the Lewis acidity of Ca(NTf2)2 and
Ca(NTf2)(PF6), Leonori et al. made some efforts in 2014 (Scheme 1.28). 43 They
reported a calcium-catalyzed Nazarov cyclization. Through controlled experiments,
they found that using solely Ca(NTf2)2 as a catalyst did not provide any product, while
adding the additive nBu4NPF6 gave the desired cyclization product, and the yield was
as high as 87% (Scheme 1.28, I).

Leonori et al. believe that the difference in Lewis acidity between Ca(NTf2)2 and
Ca(NTf2)(PF6) may explain the observed reactivity trend. Thus, they evaluated the
Lewis acidity by measuring the variation of the chemical shifts of Hβ when the C=O
group is combined with calcium-complex based on the Childs’s method.44 As shown
in Scheme 1.28, II the addition of Ca(NTf2)(PF6) to 37 resulted in the largest change
in the chemical shift of Hβ compared to the Ca(NTf2)2 complex. The trend reflects the
catalytic activity observed in Nazarov cyclzation: Ca(NTf2)(PF6) > Ca(NTf2)2.

we will next discuss the reaction mechanism of the calcium-catalyzed alkenylation.
Through literature search, we found that most of the data on the cross-coupling of allyl
alcohols and vinylboronic acids are related to palladium catalysis. Therefore, we have
classified the possible calcium-catalyzed alkenylation reaction mechanisms on the basis
of palladium and calcium catalysts. There are mainly the following four types.

enantioselective allylations with allylic alcohols in a short review in 2012.45 First, the
transition metal palladium activates the hydroxy group of allyl alcohol, then the
transition metal species will oxidatively insert into the C-OH bond to form a π-
allylpalladium intermediate. Finally, the nucleophile NuH undergoes a nucleophilic
attack, and the allylation product is released and accompanied by the regeneration of
the catalyst.

Pd-complex into the activated chiral (S)-Q from the back side stereospecifically.
Subsequently, the π-allylpalladium intermediate 40 undergoes the transmetalation to
form allylaryl palladium 41, followed by reductive elimination on the side with less
steric hindrance, and finally provides an allyl-aryl coupling product (R)-Pro14 with
excellent stereospecificity.

enantioenriched allylic alcohols and boronic acids (Scheme 1.31). 47 Although the
optimal reaction conditions and the configurations of allylic alcohol and product are
different, the proposed reaction mechanism is similar. The first step of the mechanism
is also the activation of the hydroxy group of the allylic alcohol by phenylboronic acid
to give intermediate 42.

Considering that the hydroxyl groups can be individually activated by boric acid and

As mentioned above, one can also assume other associations such as the coordination

the Lewis acidity of the boron center and form a heterobimetallic superelectrophile. The
concerted or stepwise nature of the mechanism, the role of the counterion and the
differences observed between simple allyl alcohols and N,O-acetals were also
objectives of our study (Chapter 4).

1.4. Conclusions

The above literature survey has pointed out some lack of knowledge regarding the
mechanisms of important main group metal-catalyzed reactions. Further development
of such transformations may suffer from these grey areas and we set out to shed light
on these. As shown above, many surprises can be anticipated from theoretical studies
on such reactions.


In this manuscript, I have chosen to focus on main group metal-catalyzed
transformations in which superelectrophilic activation may play a role. I have been
involved in more projects that are not detailed here (see publications list). The following
Chapters 2-4 are selected publications. Their numbering and references are independent
from each other.

2.1. Abstract

The GaCl3-mediated Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene by methyl chloride has been
studied by means of density functional theory computations at the M062X/6-
311+G(2d,2p) level of theory. The role of superelectrophilic Ga2Cl6 homodimers has
been confirmed and explained. The results are consistent with the observation of
second-order rate dependence in GaCl3-mediated Friedel−Crafts alkylations. This work
also reveals that, even in a typical Friedel−Crafts alkylation, no Wheland-type σ-
complex can be modeled, suggesting a concerted electrophilic aromatic substitution.
Also refuted is the possibility of activation of the arene nucleophile by the Lewis acid.




2.2. Introduction

Although widely used since its discovery more than 140 years ago,1,2 the Friedel−Crafts
reaction remains a topic of mechanistic debate, substantiated by computational studies.
First, the classical interpretations of electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanisms
depicting a Wheland-type σ-complex have been refuted several times, even in the
presence of a catalyst (Scheme 2.1, eq 1), with electrophiles such as SO3,3 Br2,4 Cl2,5
or alkynes,6 in favor of a concerted mechanism. Second, the role of the catalyst, not
only for the generation of the electrophile and the deprotonation step, but also as
activator of the aromatic nucleophile, has been proposed.7 Kim et al. reported that the
remarkable stability of the AlCl3·C6H6 complex, despite the loss of the benzene nodal
plane, is due to a back-donation of charge from the Cl 3p orbital to the benzene highest
                                                                                                          57

occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which prevents the loss of aromaticity (see
Scheme 2.1, eq 2). This strong interaction between AlCl3 and benzene renders the C
atom of benzene closest to the Al atom supposedly highly nucleophilic. Thus, these
authors concluded that, in addition to the generation of the electrophile, the Lewis acid
also has an important role in the activation of the aromatic substrate. Third, still related
to the number of MX3 molecules involved, the importance of dimeric forms of AlCl3
and GaCl3 in electrophilic aromatic substitutions has been revealed.8 This aspect is
taking on a new dimension nowadays, as more and more pieces of evidence are being
provided that homodimers of metal halides can act as superelectrophiles in
homogeneous catalysis and trigger new reactions.9 Although considered as uncommon
and underexplored, compared to heterobimetallic superelectrophiles comprising two
different metals, it is now better accepted that MX3 (or L·MX3) monomers can also
associate in situ to generate Lewis acidic superelectrophiles that are either M2X6
molecular adducts or MX2+MX4− ion pairs (see Scheme 2.1, eq 3).10,11 The
superelectrophilicity of the molecular adducts can be explained by the formation of a
singly bridged dimers of type X2M(μ-X)MX3, in which one metal center remains
unsaturated and more deprived of electrons than the corresponding monomer. This
adduct can be ionized to MX2+MX4−, in which the MX2+ moiety is even more electron-
deficient and potentially highly active.

While it is difficult to trace the first indication that homodimers can be involved in
Friedel−Crafts alkylations, a kinetic study by DeHaan and Brown is considered to be a
cornerstone:12 The observation of second-order rate dependence in GaCl3-mediated
methylation of benzene (or hexadeuteriobenzene) in excess methyl chloride suggests
an activation mode based on Lewis acid superelectrophiles, but their nature (molecular
adduct or ion pair) could not be established (see Scheme 2.2).9a Two transition states
were proposed: A, which accounts for an activation by the Ga2Cl6 molecular adduct,
and B, which accounts for the GaCl2+GaCl4− activation mode. Following Kim’s
proposal7 of a dual activation of the electrophile and of the nucleophile, one could add
hypothesis C, which would also correspond to the methylation rate law.

Our interest for gallium-catalyzed reactions,9b,13 the recent increase of studies

All calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 software package.14 Density
functional theory (DFT) calculations using the M06-2X functional15 were performed to
locate the stationary points (minima or transition states). The 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis
set16,17 was applied to all elements. This level of theory proved reliable to reveal the
concerted or classic nature of SEAr mechanisms.3 Harmonic vibrational frequency
calculations were performed at the same level of theory for the geometry optimizations
to confirm the nature (transition state or an energy minimum) of each stationary point.
The connectivity on the potential energy surface (PES) of the transition states was

confirmed by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations.18,19 The values presented
are ΔG298 (kcal/mol). The three-dimensional images of the optimized structures were
prepared using CYLview.20 Intrinsic bond orbital (IBO) analyses were performed with
Iboview software from the optimized geometries with the default method (PBE0/def2-
TZVP) to generate Kohn−Sham wave functions.21,22 The IBO method allows
quantitative interpretation of bonding in an intuitive way, by visualization of electronic
structure changes (electron flow) along the reaction paths.


2.4. Results and Discussion

We started our investigations by studying the methylation of benzene mediated by a
single GaCl3 molecule (see Scheme 2.3). The coordination of GaCl3 to benzene
provides the η1-complex intA1, lying 6.2 kcal/mol below the reactants int0. Ligand
exchange by methyl chloride raised the free energy to −0.4 kcal/mol while forming
intA2. The latter could be connected to the methylbenzene adduct intA4 via the
transition state tsA3. This step requires a high free energy of activation of 28.7 kcal/mol,
i.e., 28.3 kcal/mol from int0 or 34.5 kcal/mol from intA1. Complex intA4 is actually
an adduct of methylbenzene and HCl·GaCl3 exhibiting an interaction between the HCl
proton and the π-cloud of the aromatic ring. The IRC analysis did not lead directly to
this product, but optimization of its last point systematically collapsed to intA4 as the
chlorine ligands play the role of base and catch the proton. Thus, no Wheland-type σ-
complex could be found, as it is an unstable high-order point on the PES. Therefore,
the methylation seems to be a concerted process. Elimination of HCl and GaCl3 finally
leads to the final product lying at −8.2 kcal/mol.

Our next move was to investigate the methylation of benzene in the presence of two
GaCl3 molecules (see Scheme 2.4). Coordination of GaCl3 to benzene led either to the
η1-Ga2Cl6 complex intB1 or to the bis-η1-sandwich complex intB1′. The former is more
stable by 7.4 kcal/mol. Addition of methyl chloride gave the corresponding adducts
intB2 and intB2′, with a thermodynamic preference for the Ga2Cl6 complex of 2.6
kcal/mol. The alkylation transition state from intB2′ culminates at 29.3 kcal/mol, which
is slightly higher than the value found with only one GaCl3 molecule. Of note, it was
not possible to use the benzene carbon coordinated to GaCl3 to make the attack to
methyl chloride, but only the one in the para position. All this refutes the hypothesis of
                                                                                                          62

nucleophilic activation by the Lewis acid discussed in the Introduction (Scheme 2.1,
eq 2). On the other hand, the alkylation transition state from intB2 was located much
lower on the PES, at only 12.9 kcal/mol. This hypothesis also does not involve a
Wheland-type σ-complex for the same reasons as those given previously. It is in perfect
agreement with the experimentally established kinetic results,12 which show a first-
order kinetics, with respect to the aromatic reactant, and second-order kinetics for the
GaCl3 catalyst. The fact that the rate-limiting step does not involve the breakdown of
the Wheland-type σ-complex is also in harmony with DeHaan and Brown’s
experimental results. Indeed, the methylation of C6D6 was found to proceed at
essentially the same rate as benzene.12 Dissociation of the final complex intB4 into
methylbenzene, HCl, and two GaCl3 units is endergonic by 7.0 kcal/mol, which makes
the overall process exergonic by 8.2 kcal/mol. However, it is more interesting to look
at the free energy associated with the regeneration of intB1 from intB4, which is
actually −9.0 kcal/mol. Thus, the formation of HCl is not an issue, which is consistent
with the fact that this reaction, like many Friedel−Crafts alkylation, does not require a
base.

Ga2Cl6 is a solution in noncoordinating solvents and remains a dimer.23 It could be
dissociated in MeCl or form highly valent species. Following Brown’s hypothesis to
involve methyl chloride in the transition states, we then added an additional MeCl
molecule in the system (see Scheme 2.5). It led to either intC2, pertaining to the
molecular adduct activation, or intC2′, related to the ion-pair activation. However, both
are significantly less stable than intB1 and the corresponding alkylation transition state
lie higher in free energy than the one that does not display an additional MeCl molecule,
i.e., tsB3 in Scheme 2.4 at 12.9 kcal/mol, which corresponds to the best of all computed
pathways. It is noticeable that, even if the species intC2 and intC2′ were operative, the
two pathways cannot be differentiated, since the corresponding alkylation transition
states are virtually at the same energy on the PES (18.0 vs 18.2 kcal/mol). Again, the
alkylations were found concerted.


IBO analysis shows no significant differences between the computed mechanisms. The
C−Cl sp3 orbital is used to create a C−C bond with a π-extended p orbital of a benzene
carbon. The deprotonation of the σ-complex along the reaction coordinates is ensured
by a Cl p orbital interacting with the C−H sp3 orbital. The sp3 orbital of the released
HCl then slightly overlaps with the benzene π-orbital.

2.5. Conclusions

This theoretical study of the GaCl3-mediated methylation of benzene by methyl
chloride shows that the Ga2Cl6 molecular adduct is much more active than discrete
GaCl3 molecules. It behaves as a superelectrophile in this Friedel−Crafts reaction and
rationalizes the rate law reported by DeHaan and Brown. The other lessons of this study
are that (i) the intervention of an additional MeCl molecule is not necessary, the best
option being that displayed in red in Scheme 2.4; (ii) the activation of the nucleophile
by the Lewis acid is not a viable option, and (iii) once again, we have dealt with a
Friedel−Crafts reaction, which, although typical, does not seem to involve a Wheland-
type σ-complex. Beyond the Friedel−Crafts alkylation, these findings are likely to
pertain to many catalytic processes involving Lewis acids of the main group or
transition-metal series that can form homodimers (BX3, AlX3, GaX3, FeX3, etc.)24 and
should encourage people to reconsider the related mechanisms.

3.1. Abstract

The concept of alkynophilicity is revisited with group 13 MX3 metal salts (M = In, Ga,
Al, B; X = Cl, OTf) using M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) calculations. This study aims at
answering why some of these salts show reactivity toward enynes that is similar to that
observed with late-transition-metal complexes, notably Au(I) species, and why some of
them are inactive. For this purpose, the mechanism of the skeletal reorganization of 1,6-
enynes into 1-vinylcyclopentenes has been computed, including monomeric
(“standard”) and dimeric (superelectrophilic) activation. Those results are confronted
with deactivation pathways based on the dissociation of the M−X bond. The role of the
X ligand in the stabilization of the intermediate nonclassical carbocation is revealed,
and the whole features required to make a good π-Lewis acid are discussed.




3.2. Introduction

Alkynophilicity is a term that was coined in 2004 by Echavarren in the field of
homogeneous gold catalysis to qualify Lewis acids able to promote the skeletal
rearrangement (or alkoxy-cyclization) of enynes through highly polarized (η1-alkyne)-
gold(I) complexes leading to gold(I)-stabilized homoallylic (nonclassical) carbocations
(Scheme 3.1).1

                                              enynes.


Since then, the interpretation of this term has been extended to any kind of Lewis or
Brønsted acid promoting any kind of nucleophilic addition to a simple alkyne, even if
not catalytic.2 The skeletal reorganization of 1,n-enynes yet remains a specific area
among cycloisomerization reactions, and it requires specific catalysts. As a general rule,
the cycloisomerization of 1,n-enynes is a well-established strategy to rapidly increase
the molecular complexity from simple substrates and provide useful synthons. Under
metal catalysis, this transformation can lead to a wide range of carbo- and heterocyclic
products in a selective manner and is therefore perfectly suited for the diversity-oriented
synthesis of complex molecular architectures that are present in natural products,
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, or materials.3 One common cycloisomerization
pathway is the 1,6-enyne metathesis, which leads to cyclic 1,3-dienes (1-
vinylcyclopentenes, Scheme 3.2). It can be catalyzed by metal carbene complexes
typically used for olefin metathesis (e.g., Grubbs-type catalysts, metallacyclobutene
pathway, eq 1), by oxidizable transition-metal complexes (metallacyclopentene
pathway, eq 2) or by transition- or main-group-based Lewis acids (outer sphere
activation, eq 3).3,4 The mechanistic scenario is more complex in the latter case, as it
involves many possible intermediates, some of them being either discrete energy
minima in equilibrium, or resonance structures of a nonclassical carbocation.5 A
common feature in eqs 2 and 3 is the formation of a fused cyclobutene intermediate,6
which undergoes 4π conrotatory ring opening to give the final product (catalyzed by
the Lewis acid or not).

                                            metathesis.


The precise pathway with Lewis acids depends on many factors such as the nature of
the metal (including its oxidation state), ligands, counterions, solvent, etc. In any case,
its starts with the activation of the alkyne moiety, which gains a vinyl carbocation
character, triggering an exo- or endo-nucleophilic attack of the alkene. While this
chemistry is often regarded as the territory of late-transition-metal-based Lewis acid
catalysis, especially gold and platinum, main-group-metal complexes, mostly
gallium(III) and indium(III) halides,7 have also been used to promote skeletal
reorganization of enynes,8 including enyne metathesis.9 Chatani et al. reported in 2002
the first examples of GaCl3-catalyzed enyne metathesis, as shown in Scheme 3.3, eq
1.9a A cyclobutene could also be isolated when formed from a large cycloalkene (eq 2),
which is consistent with early observations reported by Trost et al., who pointed the
                                                                                         75

likely intermediacy of cyclobutenes in the formation of 1-vinylcycloalkenes when using
Pd(II) Lewis acids.10 With medium-size cycloalkenes, the normal metathesis product is
obtained, i.e., an endocyclic 1,3-diene (eq 3).9a,9b This reaction was exploited for the
synthesis of various natural products, such as salviasperanol by Sarpong et al.11

The mechanism of the GaCl3-catalyzed enyne metathesis postulated by Chatani et al. is
shown in Scheme 3.4.9a Enyne 7 first forms the vinyl carbocation 8 upon coordination
of the alkyne moiety to GaCl3. Nucleophilic attack of the alkene part generates the
nonclassical carbocation 9 or other isomers (9′ or 9″). The latter is then transformed
into the η1-cyclobutene complex 10. Elimination of GaCl3 leads to the strained
cyclobutene 11, which undergoes conrotatory 4π ring opening to provide 1-
vinylcyclopentene 12. The product is obtained in a stereospecific manner, the cis- and
trans-substituent Rc and Rt being found with the indicated stereochemical relationships.

As such, the proposed mechanism with GaCl3 does not differ much from the one
postulated with late-transition-metal-based Lewis acid catalysts, notably gold(I)
complexes.1,12 While the alkynophilicity (or enynophilicity) of Au(I) complexes has
been related to relativistic effects and to the ability of the soft polarizable gold atom to
stabilize the intermediate nonclassical carbocation by back-donation,5b,13 these typical
features of late-transition metals cannot be used to explain the alkynophilicity of main-
group-based species. This raises the question of what makes GaCl3 and InCl3 good
alkynophilic π-Lewis acids in comparison to late-transition-metal complexes such as
LAu(I)+ species, or even compared to BCl3, AlCl3, or Ga(OTf)3 which do not work as
catalysts for enyne cycloisomerization. Is it simply a matter of hardness or softness of
the Lewis acid?14 Is there any specific activation of the substrate (superelectrophilic
activation?) or specific stabilization of the nonclassical carbocation? Can an analogy be
made between relativistic contraction of the 6s orbital of gold13 and the d-block
contraction of gallium?15 This theoretical study aims at answering these questions and
demystifies some stereotypes about the alkynophilicity of Lewis acids.

3.3. Computational Methods

All of the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the
Gaussian 09 set of programs.16 The M06-2X17 functional was used for the geometry
optimization in the gas phase with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set18 for all elements, except
Au and In for which the LANL2DZ(ECP) basis set was employed.19 Harmonic
vibrational frequency calculations were performed for all of the stationary points to
determine whether they are local minima or transition structures and to derive the
thermochemical corrections at 273.15 K for the enthalpies and free energies. The same
functional and basis set were used to calculate the single-point energies in toluene from
the gas-phase stationary points with the CPCM model.20 The discussed energies are
Gibbs free energies (ΔG273, kcal/mol). The connectivity of all transition states has been
verified by the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analysis.21 NPA22 charges were
computed with the NBO program implemented in Gaussian (version 3.1).


3.4. Results and Discussion

3.4.1. Superelectrophilic vs “Standard” Activation

In addition to being powerful π-activators, neutral and cationic gallium(III) and
gallium(I) species are well-known σ-activators of C−O or C−halide bonds.7a,23 Recent
studies of the mechanism of the carbonyl-olefin metathesis reaction (C−O bond
activation),24 or of the gallium-catalyzed Friedel−Crafts alkylation (C−halide bond
activation)25 have revealed that gallium(III) homodimers such as [(LGaCl2)2]2+ or
Ga2Cl6 are much more active σ-Lewis acids than the corresponding monomers
[(LGaCl)2]+ or GaCl3 (Scheme 3.5). These findings are in line with the inspiring work
of Schindler and co-workers, who demonstrated that iron(III) homodimers are involved
in the carbonyl-olefin metathesis of aliphatic ketones.26 Such reactions echo Negishi’s
principle of activation of electrophiles by electrophiles27 and were linked by Schindler
et al. to Olah’s concept of superelectrophiles.28 Previous computational studies on
                                                                                         78

2002 Chatani’s proposal.9a Four pathways for superelectrophilic Ga(III)-homodimer-
catalyzed skeletal reorganization of enyne 1 have been considered, all starting from the
Ga2Cl6 homodimer I and its coordination to the C≡C bond of enyne 1 to give the
gallium-enyne complex II. In path A (black), complex II reveals its vinyl carbocation
character depicted as III and undergoes nucleophilic attack of the alkene moiety at C2
to give the tertiary carbocation IV. The cyclobutene complex V is then obtained after
C1−C7 bond formation. 4π Ring opening then takes place in the presence of the gallium
cluster to give VI and then the final product 2 after demetallation, which regenerates
catalyst I. Alternatively, the demetallation may precede the 4π ring opening, the free
cyclobutene VII becoming an intermediate (path B). The six-membered ring vinyl
gallium complex VIII is also a possible intermediate toward V. It can be accessed from
III (path C) or from IV (path C′). Finally, 7-endo-dig cyclization forming the C1−C7
bond may also be considered from II, leading to complex IX, which could undergo ring
contraction to the cyclobutene complex V (path D).

  Scheme 3.6. Possible reaction pathways for Ga(III)-homodimer-catalyzed skeletal
               reorganization of enyne 1 to form 1-vinylcycloalkene 2.


Following the above proposal, calculations were performed to reveal the mechanism of
the Ga(III)-homodimer-catalyzed skeletal reorganization of 1,6-enyne 1. Enyne 1 and
two molecules of GaCl3 were chosen as the reference system for the free energy profile
(Scheme 3.7). These two discrete molecules of GaCl3 were used instead of the Ga2Cl6
dimer I to allow direct comparison with a single GaCl3 catalyst molecule (Scheme 3.10).
The computed free energy of the formation of I from 2 GaCl3 is −22.0 kcal/mol (see
upper box in Scheme 3.7). The experimental value is −21.0 kcal/mol,33 which validates
the chosen level of theory. Optimized geometries of some key transition structures and
intermediates are presented in Figure 3.1. Coordination of 1,6-enyne 1 to the gallium
center generates intermediate II, which is exergonic by 32.4 kcal/mol. From Ga2Cl6, a
correction of 22.0 kcal/mol must be applied, i.e., −10.4 kcal/mol instead of −32.4
kcal/mol, meaning that Cl/alkyne ligand exchange is favorable. Depending on the ester
orientation, a more stable isomer III was found (−36.1 kcal/mol). Both II and III have
geometrical features that are close to what is expected for a vinyl carbocation (C1C2
1.22 Å; C2C3 1.46 Å),34 but the longer GaC2 distance in III (2.59 vs 2.49 Å) and the
higher charge at C2 (0.185 vs 0.170) advocate such a depiction for this species. The
two isomers are connected by a low-lying transition state corresponding to the rotation
of one ester function (II-TS-III). Bringing the alkene closer to the vinyl carbocation
promotes the formation of the C2−C6 bond. The energy barrier for this step is only 1.4
kcal/mol (III-TS-IV). The resulting complex IV is more stable than III by 9.3 kcal/mol.
With its long C2C7 distance of 1.70 Å, its structure corresponds to a resonance hybrid
between an α-cyclopropyl carbocation and a homoallyl carbocation. Contrarily to the
proposed intermediate 9 in Scheme 3.4, there is no interaction between C1 and C7 at
this stage (C1C7 2.62 Å), so the species is actually closer to 9′. The formation of the
cyclobutene complex V is achieved through IV-TS-V, which lies only 3.5 kcal/mol
above IV. This step is exergonic by 7.2 kcal/mol. In V, the gallium atom coordinated
to the double bond is significantly shifted toward the gem-dimethyl group (GaC1 2.26
                                                                                         81

Ring opening is achieved through another low-lying transition state providing VI′, in
which the positive charge is delocalized between C7 and C6 (C2C7 1.87 Å) (Scheme
3.8). The energy barrier for this step, which releases 0.9 kcal/mol free energy, is 3.8
kcal/mol. Elongation of the C2−C7 bond is barrierless and provides the final complex
VI with a gain of 21.5 kcal/mol. In VI, the gallium center is shifted toward C1 (GaC7
2.46 Å; GaC1 2.39 Å). Ligand exchange between VI and 1 to give back II and furnish
2 is endergonic by 7.5 kcal/mol only (see lower box). According to Chatani’s proposal
(Scheme 3.4), the catalyst is removed from complex V to form the free cyclobutene
VII (Path B). The latter is more stable than 1 by 11.1 kcal/mol. The 4π ring-opening
transition state between VII and 2 culminates at 16.2 kcal/mol, i.e., a barrier of 27.3
kcal/mol. Thus, even though the ligand exchange between V and 1 to give back II and
provide VII has a reasonable free energy cost of 9.0 kcal/mol (see lower box in Scheme
3.7), the Lewis acid-assisted ring opening appears much more favorable.

An alternative pathway corresponding to the 7-endo-dig cyclization discussed above
(Scheme 3.7, path D) was also envisaged (blue part). This was achieved through II-
TS-IX, lying 4.2 kcal/mol above II. This step is strongly exergonic by 23.2 kcal/mol.
Since the energy barrier is higher than those found in path A, path D was not further
considered. Overall, the selectivity-determining transition state is III-TS-IV in Scheme
3.7.

As mentioned above (Scheme 3.6), III and IV could possibly evolve to intermediate
VIII (paths C and C′). However, no such complex could be optimized. Yu’s group
reported that the monomeric GaCl3 can form such complexes without substituents at
the terminal alkene carbon.8e Therefore, we calculated an annulation transition state
with a monosubstituted and an unsubstituted terminal alkene carbon (Scheme 3.9). In
such cases, the formation of type VIII compound became indeed possible with Ga2Cl6
as shown below, or with GaCl3 (not shown). Thus, there is a continuum between type
IV and type VIII complexes, which depends on the ability of the substitution pattern to
stabilize the positive charge at position 6 or 7.

standard one. The free energy profile with a single molecule of GaCl3 as a catalyst is

kcal/mol above those computed with Ga2Cl6. The transition state III-TS-IVmono
corresponds to the RDS. The related free energy barrier is 2.5 vs 1.4 kcal/mol in the
two-gallium series. A notable difference in the structures is a shorter C2-C7 distance in
IVmono (1.66 vs 1.70 Å), which can be attributed to an electron-richer character of the
C1−C2 bond with only one GaCl3, making it more able to delocalize electrons to C7.
In addition, the final complex VImono converges as an η2 rather than a slipped η1 species
(GaC7 2.48 Å; GaC1 2.42 Å).

preference is of 3.7 kcal/mol. However, the gain in free energy of the coordination of
the enyne triple bond to the gallium center is 4.3 kcal/mol higher than the coordination
of chlorine (Scheme 3.11: −36.1 vs −40.4 kcal/mol). This clearly compensates the
lower free energy of activation of 1.4 vs 2.5 kcal/mol of the RDS (III-TS-IV vs III-
TS-IVmono).

Therefore, unlike the σ-Lewis acid-catalyzed reactions shown in Scheme 3.5, the
interest of superelectrophilic activation of enyne 1 is not supported by the computations.
However, enyne 1 possesses a highly nucleophilic alkene moiety. With one less methyl
group or no methyl group at the alkene terminus, the free energy of activation of the
first C−C bond formation significantly increases (Scheme 3.9). In such case, even if
the formation of mono-gallium alkyne species is more favorable than a digallium

The electronic properties of the metal alkyne complexes were then analyzed.35 The
vinyl cation character of species II, III, IImono, and IIImono is actually revealed by a
significant positive charge and a large lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
lobe at C2 (Figure 3.2). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of these
complexes is concentrated on the alkene moiety. Type III isomers have a lower
HOMO−LUMO energy difference and a higher positive charge at C2 compared to II.
The presence of a second GaCl3 molecule also reduces the HOMO−LUMO gap and
increases the charge at C2.

There is no correlation between ΔE (H − L) and the free energy of activation between
III and IV in different metal complex series (Figure 3.2 and Scheme 3.13). With the
Ph3PAu+ moiety, ΔE (H − L) is the lowest of the series (6.732 eV) but the highest barrier
was computed (7.5 kcal/mol).36 With Ga(OTf)3, a complex which is not active
experimentally, a very low barrier of 0.8 kcal/mol was computed in spite of a higher
ΔE (H − L) of 7.043 eV. It should also be noted that the formation of the gold-stabilized
nonclassical carbocation is also the less exergonic process of the series (−2.2 vs −7.3
and −15.5 kcal/mol).

Thus, although superelectrophilic activation has a positive impact on the reaction rate,
this effect is not a prerequisite for alkynophilicity. The barrier of the formation of
intermediate IIImono is sufficiently low and the reaction sufficiently exergonic to qualify
GaCl3, as a monomer, as an alkynophilic species. The case of Ga(OTf)3, an
experimentally inactive catalyst which yet leads to the lowest activation energy, brings

further questions and stimulates the test of other group 13 species. In addition, to avoid
a particular case effect of the gem-dimethyl at the alkene terminus or the gem-diester
group in the tether of enyne 1, over enynes were also studied.


3.4.2. σ- vs π-Lewis Acidity

As mentioned above, group 13 MX3 salts are not only π-Lewis acids able to activate
C−C π-bonds but also strong oxophilic σ-Lewis acids. Enyne 1′ was used to study the
effect of the ester group coordination to the overall free energy required to reach the
cyclization transition state (Scheme 3.14). As expected, the coordination of the ester
moiety of the enyne is always more favorable than the coordination of the alkyne,
except for the gold complex.23 Of note, even InCl3 does not form a chelate with the two
carbonyl group. None of these species seem to be intrinsically poorly alkynophilic, but
we can note that the free energy difference between X and III-TS-IV is quite too high
for the reaction to occur at room or lower temperatures with AlCl3 (25.8 kcal/mol).

                                        and III-TS-IV.).


Although BCl3 is a good Lewis acid, it is reluctant to pyramidalization.37 The donor-
acceptor adducts of BCl3 with alkynes or ester groups are activated forms toward
nucleophilic attack, but they can be made in an endergonic manner,38 as it is the case
here. The transition state remains easily accessible (12.7 kcal/mol), and the cyclization
is appreciably exergonic by 19.0 kcal/mol. However, the cyclized product does not
converge as a BCl3 adduct. A spontaneous 1,2-chloride transfer to the carbocationic
center leads to an alkyldichloroboron species. Such group transfer has been reported in
the case of the B(C6F5)3-promoted cyclopropanation/carboboration of enynes.39,40


At this stage, we can conclude that all of these species are potentially alkynophilic, but
oxophilicity41 and chloride transfer can be an issue. Unlike all other MCl3 salts, AlCl3
is poorly soluble in apolar solvents such as toluene. The use of a more polar solvent
such as acetone, nitrobenzene, or tetrahydrofuran (THF), in which AlCl3 dissolves,
means the formation of strongly bound O−Al donor−acceptor adducts that can be
dormant species. The same is true for Ga(OTf)3, which in spite of a good intrinsic
alkynophilicity in the gas phase, is soluble in strongly bonding solvents only (i.e., H2O,
MeNO2, etc.).42 As for BCl3, a catalytic use is compromised by the formation of an
RBCl2 species after chloroboration. This specific kind of deactivation led us to study
the 1,2-chloride transfer with the other group 13 species. We also noted that in the
absence of the esters in the tether, it became possible to optimize species IV with BCl3
intact, offering a comparative analysis between the formation of the next species on the
cycloisomerization pathway (i.e., the cyclobutene) and the formation of the chlorinated
species.

chloride transfer described above is no longer spontaneous (Scheme 3.15).43 This
process was thus compared with the formation of the cyclobutene intermediate. Again,
all MX3 species appear as good alkynophilic π-Lewis acids in the sense that the
transition state III-TS-IV is readily accessible and the formation of IV is exergonic and
followed by another low-lying transition state IV-TS-V leading to an even more stable
species. The 1,2-chloride transfer could be modeled in the indium, gallium, and boron
series, but not in the aluminum one. With aluminum, even trying to get XI led back to
IV. With indium and gallium, the chloride transfer is strongly disfavored over the
cyclobutene formation, both thermodynamically and kinetically. With boron, the
difference between the transition states is only 0.3 kcal/mol in favor of the cyclobutene
formation, but the chlorinated product XI is more stable by 2.2 kcal/mol than
cyclobutene V. Thus, by reversibility, the formation of XI can be a trap.

Another deactivation pathway that could explain the inactivity of AlCl3 and BCl3 could
be the formation of ion pairs. We have already reported in a precedent study that the
[GaCl2]+[GaCl4]− ion pair is less active than GaCl3 with enynes exhibiting a gem-diester
group in their tether.8f Even in the absence of the gem-diester group, the alkyne and the
alkene could trap the cationic MCl2+ ion by forming a chelate. All of this was studied
within the entire MCl3 series (Scheme 3.16).

With BCl3, the molecular adduct XII, lying 10.8 kcal/mol above the reactants, was
modeled. The corresponding ion pair XIII in which there is no interaction between the
alkene and the boron center was obtained at a much higher free energy of 27.1 kcal/mol.
For gallium and aluminum, the catalytically viable vinyl cation XIV was found to be
markedly more stable than the corresponding chelate XV (Ga: −32.4 vs −22.4 kcal/mol;

Al: −18.5 vs −6.5 kcal/mol). In the indium series, the molecular chelated adduct XVI
was computed in addition to the vinyl cation XIV. These two compounds have similar
energies and are much more stable than the ion pair XV (−21.0/−21.5 vs −6.7 kcal/mol).
Thus, the formation of ion pairs cannot be blamed for catalyst deactivation, at least in
solvents of low polarity such as toluene.


Finally, the aforementioned Ga2Cl6 dimer formation was reevaluated with the other
group 13 elements (Scheme 3.17). It is well known that GaCl3 forms Ga2Cl6 dimers in
the solid state and in weakly coordinating solvents.33,44 As shown in Scheme 3.16, the
formation of the vinyl cation XIV liberates 32.4 kcal/mol of free energy, while that of
Ga2Cl6 provides 22.0 kcal/mol. Even the formation of two monomeric alkyne adducts
such as III in Scheme 3.15 would release 2 × 17.8 = 35.6 kcal/mol, meaning that Ga2Cl6
is not a thermodynamic trap. The same conclusion can be reached with In2Cl6 (−15.5
vs −21.0 or −22.4 kcal/mol) and Al2Cl6 (−17.2 vs −18.5 or −23.8 kcal/mol). As for the
boron case, there is no question asked since BCl3 does not form dimers.15

3.4.4. Origin of the Alkynophilicity

As seen above, even though superelectrophilic activation is helpful with less reactive
enynes, it is not a requirement for a successful reaction. The reason why MX3 species
are alkynophilic lies somewhere else, and the fact that they are all intrinsically
alkynophilic in the gas phase rules out an explanation based on d-block contraction or
hardness vs softness. Obviously, the exceptional stabilization of type IV intermediates
cannot be related to d orbitals or M → L back-donation since d orbitals are either absent
                                                                                         95

(B, Al) or inaccessible (Ga, In).45 We looked for an answer in the ligands themselves.
As far as the organic fragment originating from the enyne is concerned in complexes
IV-Au and IV-GaCl3 (Figure 3.3), there is virtually no geometrical difference. In the
gallium complex, one can note that one C1GaCl angle is smaller than the other (91.43
vs 108.17 and 117.20°). This suggests that one chlorine atom is well oriented to transfer
electron density to the carbocationic part of the complex. A mapped plan of the electron
density passing through C1, Ga, and Cl shows the flow of electron density in this area.
The LUMO of IV-GaCl3 shows the empty p orbital system with the largest contribution
in the vicinity of one chlorine atom. Examination of the occupied orbitals reveals an
overlap on the Cl−C1−C2−C6 system in HOMO-5. The same features were observed
in the IV-Ga2Cl6 series, the Cl−C1−C2−C6 overlap corresponding this time to HOMO-
2. Of note, we found the same kind of interaction in IV-Ga(OTf)3 in which one oxygen
and one fluorine atom stabilize the carbocationic system. Thus, we attribute the
stabilization of type IV intermediates to noncovalent or weakly covalent interactions
between the heteroatoms of the metal ligands and the carbocationic system.

3.5. Conclusions

This study has shown that MX3 salts are all alkynophilic in the gas phase, regardless of
their hardness or softness. What makes a large difference between active catalysts such
as GaCl3 or InCl3 and inactive ones such as AlCl3 or Ga(OTf)3 is their solubility in
apolar solvents. While GaCl3 is even soluble in pentane, dissolving AlCl3 or Ga(OTf)3
requires the use of heteroatom-containing polar solvents, which traps the catalyst. On
the other hand, the highly soluble BCl3 salt follows particular deactivation pathways
due to a weaker M−Cl bond. No other factors such as the formation of dormant
                                                                                               97

oligomers or ion pairs could rationalize the inactivity of AlCl3 or BCl3. Among the
group 13 MX3 salts studied, GaCl3 showed a pronounced ability to activate enynes in
spite of its strong oxophilicity. The lack of nucleophilic character of the enyne alkene
moiety can be counterbalanced by increasing the electrophilicity of the alkyne moiety
by superelectrophilic activation using the Ga2Cl6 homodimer. The mechanism of the
skeletal reorganization is similar to the gold-catalyzed one. What makes GaCl3 such a
good π-acid is a combination of: (i) its high solubility in apolar solvents, (ii) its strong
Ga−Cl bonds, which do not easily break to give ion pairs or chlorogallation products,
and (iii) its ability to stabilize the nonclassical carbocation IV by Cl p orbital back-
donation to the empty p orbitals of the organic framework. A thorough knowledge of
all of these subtle factors should stimulate the development of even more selective
main-group-based Lewis acids able to compete with late-transition-metal complexes.

4.1. Abstract

The mechanism of the calcium-catalyzed coupling of alcohols with vinylboronic acids
has been analyzed by means of DFT computations. This study reveals that the calcium
and the boron Lewis acids associate to form a superelectrophile able to trigger a
pericyclic group transfer reaction with allyl alcohols. With other alcohols, the two
Lewis acids act synergistically to activate the OH functionality and trigger a S Ni
reaction pathway. These two mechanisms are affected by the nature of the counterion,
which has been rationalized by electronic and steric factors.




4.2. Introduction

During the past decade, calcium-based Lewis acids have witnessed an upsurge in
applications in homogeneous catalysis. This renaissance was mostly led by the group
of Niggemann who reported that Ca(NTf2)2 can be activated by an ammonium salt of a
weakly coordinating anion such as nBu4NPF6 to give a highly oxophilic Lewis acid
able to abstract hydroxy groups and promote cationic transformations.1,2 This strategy
is also efficient with Ca(OTf)2.3 Other functional groups can also be activated, such as
ketones or alkenes.4 The structure of Ca(NTf2)2·4H2O was reported in 2005 and shows
that the calcium ion is not bound to the nitrogen atom of the NTf2− counterion but to
the oxygen atoms of the SO2CF3 moiety adopting a cis configuration of the CF3 groups

(Scheme 4.1, eq 1).5 This relationship between the metal and its counterions is in sharp
contrast with soft transition metals that are usually coordinated to the nitrogen atom,
and it reveals the strong oxophilicity of calcium. Thus, Ca(NTf2)2 is not a very strong
Lewis acid since the counterions are strongly coordinated and occupy four coordination
sites of the metal. On the other hand, a mixture of Ca(NTf2)2 and nBu4NPF6 has a more
pronounced Lewis acidity, as shown by the NMR Childs test (Scheme 4.1, eq 2).4b
Indirect spectroscopic evidence based on the disappearance of the 19F NMR signals of
the spinning counterions attached to the metal center suggested the formation of
[Ca(NTf2)]+[PF6]− (Scheme 4.1, eq 1).4b,6 The driving force of this anion metathesis,
during which a strongly coordinated anion (NTf2− or OTf−) is replaced by a weakly
coordinating one (PF6−), might be due to a higher solubility of the heteroleptic species.

The mixture composed of Ca(NTf2)2 and nBu4NPF6 or other [R4N]+[WCA]− species
(WCA = weakly coordinating anion) proved particularly efficient for catalyzing the
nucleophilic substitution of alcohols, a process that is believed to follow a SN1
pathway.1a As far as we are concerned, we have developed the calcium-catalyzed
coupling of alcohols with vinylboronic acids (Scheme 4.2).7 This alkenylation reaction
is efficient toward allyl, benzyl, and propargyl alcohols (Scheme 4.2 eq 3)7a and N,O-

allyl alcohol 1a. Besides, for alcohols such as 1a, the structure of the product 3a does

To rationalize these experimental results, we decided to explore the mechanism of these
two coupling reactions by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.8 Of course,
most data available on the cross-coupling of allyl alcohols with vinylboronic acids are
related to palladium catalysis (Scheme 4.3). The reaction might start with the oxidative
addition of palladium to produce a π-allylpalladium intermediate by direct activation of
the hydroxy group (i).9 Alternatively, the hydroxy group of the allyl alcohol can be
activated by the boronic acid to facilitate the oxidative addition (ii).10 With calcium,
while these two activation modes can be envisaged, we also considered in this study
the synergistic activation of the hydroxy group by the two Lewis acids (Ca and B) (iii).

A last possibility would be a Lewis acid activation of the boronic acid itself by
coordination of the calcium salt to the oxygen atoms of the boronic acid (iv). We have
shown in the past that the calcium(II) ion can strengthen the acidity of Brønsted acids
such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP),11 which triggers reactions such as the
hydroamidation4c or the hydroarylation of alkenes.4d Herein, the principle of activation
of an electrophile (B) by another electrophile (Ca) through heterodimeric association,
leading to a superelectrophile,12,13 is revisited, and the role of the counterions is
analyzed.

We have used the Gaussian 09 set of programs14 to perform density functional theory
(DFT) computations. All structures were optimized and characterized as energy minima
or transition states (TS) at the M06-2X15/6-31G(d) level. The energies were then refined

The feasibility of the above proposed mechanism (Scheme 4.3, (i)) was first examined
(Figure 4.1). There are two reaction zero points considering that both Ca(NTf2)2 and
Ca(NTf2)(PF6) can be active catalysts depending on the use of nBu4NPF6 as additive.


The connection between these two profiles can be obtained from the free energy of the
formation of Ca(NTf2)(PF6) from Ca(NTf2)2 and nBu4NPF6, which is 5.7 kcal mol-1.

The coordination of the hydroxy group of alcohol 1a to Ca(NTf2)2 to provide complex
IN1a is exergonic by 3.4 kcal mol-1. There is a hydrogen bond between one sulfonyl

oxygen and the OH group (S=OH–O 1.973 Å) which disappears in the subsequent

transition state (TS) and product. The cleavage of the C–O bond must overcome a
barrier of 34.1 kcal mol-1 through transition state TS2a. This process is markedly
endergonic by 32.4 kcal mol-1 (IN3a). In spite of its stronger Lewis acidity (Scheme
4.1, eq 2), Ca(NTf2)(PF6) leads to an even higher barrier of 38.1 kcal mol-1 from IN1b
to provide IN3b in a strongly endergonic fashion (34.4 kcal mol-1). With such high free
energies of activation, this type of SN1 mechanism was not considered any further.

not possible to accommodate the two Lewis acids on the same oxygen donor atom. The
species converged as IN1 (see Figure 4.3) in which calcium is coordinated to an OH
group of the boronic acid, leading to the following discussion (Section 4.4.1.4).


4.4.1.4. Lewis Acid Activation of the Boronic Acid (Ca/B; formal SN2’)


The formation of IN1 from Ca(NTf2)2, 1a and 2a is exergonic by 1.0 kcal mol-1 (Figure
4.3). Two oxygen atoms of 2a are coordinated to the calcium center. The oxygen atom
of 1a is coordinated by the boron center and is bound to the calcium salt through a

hydrogen bond involving the NTf2- counterion (S=OH–O 1.889 Å). Trying to cleave

the C–O bond of 1a actually led to the concomitant formation of a C–C bond through
the six-membered ring transition state TS2, which requires a reasonable activation
energy of 20.2 kcal mol-1 relatively to IN1.

This process is markedly exergonic by 44.4 kcal mol-1 and gives IN3. Elimination of
B(OH)3 and Ca(NTf2)2 finally leads to the final product 3a lying at −39.4 kcal mol-1.


At this stage, two important features are worth emphasizing:


1− The geometry of TS2 and the FMO analysis of its fragment clearly shows that it
corresponds to a pericyclic suprafacial/suprafacial group transfer reaction (Figure
4.4).19 To the best of our knowledge, such a group transfer reaction has not been
described before.

transition state becomes 51.2 kcal mol-1 (Scheme 4.4), which reveals the crucial role of
the catalyst in activating the boron Lewis acid. The interaction between 1a and 2a
cannot even not be modeled if the calcium is not bound to the OH groups of the boronic
acid (virtually planar RB(OH)2 moiety vs pyramidal boron center in IN1), showing that
its role is to strengthen the electrophilicity of the boron reagent.

                                         group transfer reaction.


With the Ca(NTf2)(PF6) species, in agreement with the experimental results, the barrier
to reach the same kind of six-membered ring transition state is markedly higher (Figure
4.3, right). The free energy difference between IN4 and TS5 is 27.1 kcal mol-1, versus
20.2 with Ca(NTf2)2. Of note, inverting the position of the PF6- and the NTf2- ions led
to an even higher-lying transition state (30.8 kcal mol-1 instead of 27.1 kcal mol-1, see
Figure 4.5).

We have carefully analyzed the hydrogen bonds between the NTf2- oxygen atoms and
the various OH groups of the two substrates (1a and 2a). The strongest ones are
indicated in Figure 4.3. Even though there are less possibilities of such noncovalent
interactions with the Ca(NTf2)(PF6) fragment compared to Ca(NTf2)2, we could not
explain the difference of efficiency between these two active species on the basis of
hydrogen bonding. With the more electrophilic Ca(NTf2)(PF6) species, the coordinated
boronic acid is also more electrophilic and this facilitates the OH abstraction, as shown
by the shortest breaking C–O bond in TS5 compared to TS2 (2.286 vs 2.353 Å).
However, the nucleophilicity of the vinyl group is also a crucial factor. With a more
electrophilic calcium activator, the vinyl group will be less nucleophilic. This transpires

                                                                                                              119

in the geometry of the transitions states as well, the forming C–C being longer in TS5
than in TS2 (2.552 vs 2.475 Å). The natural charges confirm this trend (Figure 4.6),
with for instance the qC charge which is more negative with Ca(NTf2)2 than with
Ca(NTf2)(PF6) (-0.453 vs -0.447 e). Thus, the right balance must be found to efficiently
activate the boronic acid while maintaining its nucleophilicity. This is why the reaction
of 1a with 2a is more efficient with Ca(NTf2)2 than with Ca(NTf2)(PF6). The fact that
the reaction does not obey a SN1 mechanism but a concerted group transfer explains
why a less electrophilic activator is a better option in this case.

The temperature of the reaction such as that shown in Scheme 4.2 (Eq 4) is 50 °C. At
that temperature, the anion metathesis requires a free energy of 5.5 kcal mol-1 (Figure
4.7). Similarly to the results obtained in the first section, OH abstraction faces very high
barriers: 34.8 kcal mol-1 with Ca(NTf2)2; 36.1 kcal mol-1 with Ca(NTf2)(PF6). The SN1
mechanism is therefore also ruled out for 3-hydroxyisoindolinone.

center provides complex IN1’, lying 2.0 kcal mol-1 below the reactants IN0’ (Figure
4.8). There is not interaction between the OH group of 1a’ and the boron center at this
stage, but while the C–O bond breaks, the OH group directly migrates to boron and not
to calcium. This step through TS2’ requires a free energy of activation of 21.1 kcal mol-
1
    from IN1’ and is endergonic by 14.6 kcal mol-1. The vinyl group is then delivered
from the intimate ion pair IN3’ to IN5’ in a strongly exergonic fashion. The
corresponding transition state TS4’ culminates at 28.2 kcal mol-1 on the free energy
surface. Finally, the Ca(NTf2)2 is regenerated with concomitant release of B(OH)3 and
product 3a’, which is 31.0 kcal mol-1 below the reactants. Overall, this process needs
to overcome an energy barrier as high as 30.2 kcal mol-1, which is consistent with the
experimental results in which no product was observed (Scheme 4.2, Eq 4). On the
other hand, 92% yield was obtained with the use of nBu4NPF6. The corresponding
mechanism is shown by the red line in Figure 4.8. Coordination of 3-
hydroxyisoindolinone 1a’ and (E)-styrylboronic acid 2a to the calcium center is slightly
endergonic, placing the resulting intermediate IN6’ at 3.9 kcal mol-1 on the free energy
surface. Hydroxy group migration to boron to generate the ion pair IN8’ is achieved
through TS7’. This step needs to cross an energy barrier of 22.2 kcal mol-1 relatively to
IN0’’’. Then, the nucleophilic addition occurs through TS9’, located at 25.0 kcal mol-1
on the free energy surface (vs 28.2 kcal mol-1 for TS4’). We have also considered other
possible hydroxy and counterions orientation, but the corresponding activation energies
of these nucleophilic additions were significantly higher (see Figure 4.9). Finally, the
Ca(NTf2)(PF6) is regenerated with concomitant release of the desired product 3a’ and
B(OH)3. Thus, the best computed mechanism of the vinylation of 3-
hydroxyisoindolinones is a substitution nucleophilic intramolecular (SNi) going
through an ion pair. In such processes, the leaving group and the nucleophile are
exchanged on the same side of the substrate.

we have used the Global Nucleophilicity (N) proposed by Domingo et al.20 but no
significant difference could be found (see Figure 4.10). On the other hand, noncovalent
interactions analysis (NCIs)21 of the nucleophilic addition transition states TS4’ and
TS9’ proved relevant (Figure 4.11). There is a lone pair repulsion between the oxygen
of NTf2- ion and the oxygen atom of the isoindolinone cation in transition state TS4’,
which explains why this structure is more difficult to reach compared to TS9’. The
proximity between the two oxygen atoms is imposed by the large size of the NTf2- ion.
With the smaller PF6- counterion, the NTf2- is far from the carbonyl group.

4.5. Conclusions

The proposed mechanisms of the calcium(II)-catalyzed coupling of alcohols with
vinylboronic acids are summarized in Scheme 4.5. For the reaction of allyl alcohols,
the calculations favored a pericyclic group transfer reaction in which the calcium and
the boron Lewis acids form a superelectrophilic complex. The reason why Ca(NTf2)2
is better than Ca(NTf2)(PF6) is attributed to a better electronic balance. In the transition
state, the activated boron is rendered electrophilic enough abstract the OH group of the
alcohol but the nucleophilicity of the vinyl group should not be too much affected. Since
Ca(NTf2)2 is a weaker Lewis acid than Ca(NTf2)(PF6), its counterion combination
represents the best compromise. For alcohols for which a concerted mechanism is no
longer possible, such as 3-hydroxyisoindolinones, the DFT study supported a SNi-type

reaction. The abstraction of the OH group is facilitated by a synergistic activation by
the two Lewis acids. Rather than an electronic tuning provided by the counterion, we
found that the better activity of the Ca(NTf2)(PF6) species was due to the smaller size
of the PF6- ion compared to NTf2-, which allows to avoid a pair repulsion between one
of the NTf2- oxygen and the carbonyl group of the substrate. Overall, this study sheds
light on the cooperativity between two Lewis acids in catalysis and on the counterion
effects is such coupling reactions.

General Conclusion

This doctoral thesis has been meant to broaden our knowledge about the mechanisms
involved in important main group metal-catalyzed organic transformations using
computational chemistry. Many of the preceding theoretical studies reported in the
literature have considered the active species as corresponding to its molecular formula,
e.g. MX3 for simple salts such as AlCl3. However, several MX3 units can associate to
form in situ various unsuspected complexes, including singly bridged M2X6 compounds,
whose Lewis acidity is more pronounced than isolated MX3 molecules. Refered to as
superelectrophiles, we have shown that they can play a crucial role in well-known
reactions such as the Friedel-Crafts alkylation or the skeletal reorganization of enynes.


In addition, we have played our part in debates regarding the Friedel-Crafts reaction,
including the fact that such transformations can be concerted, or that the Lewis acid
does not activate the nucleophile.


Clearly, this work on the Friedel-Crafts reaction has taught us that the chlorine atoms
are not innocent, as they participate in the formation of superelectrophilic species. Our
work on the sketetal reorganization of enynes revealed that they also participate in the
stabilization of important intermediates such as nonclassical carbocations. This finding
was essential to understand why GaCl3 or InCl3, which have no accessible empty d
orbitals nor orbitals that can be engaged in back bonding, are yet able to catalyze enyne
metathesis reactions just like late transition metal complexes do. This teamplay between
the main group metal and the halogen ligand confers a similar reactivity to MX3 salts
compared to gold or platinum complexes. This feature could be exploited in the future
to develop new transition metal free reactions.


While the role of halide ligands has been shown to be fundamental in main group metal
catalyzed Friedel-Crafts and cycloisomerization reactions, we have also carefully
looked into the role of supposedly non-coordinating anions such as NTf2- or PF6-. Since

                                                                                      131


                                     General Conclusion



most of the literature available is about transition metal catalyzed reactions and not
main group metal catalyzed ones, we may have a biased vision of the mechanisms and
we must forget what we have learned. With main group s or p elements, oxidative
additions or reductive eliminations are not viable routes. Likewise, the coordinating
ability of a counterion is not the same for a transition metal or a main group one. In that
respect, the study of a calcium-catalyzed cross coupling reaction was an edifying
glimpse behind the scenes. Our calculations have delineated an unsuspected mechanism
in which the counterions remain coordinated to the metal center and in which one Lewis
acid activates another to ultimately allow the activation of the substrate. This journey
was another source of inspiration for the development of other transition metal free
reactions mimicked by the use of main group complexes as catalysts.


Due to the complexity of the studied systems, including the fact that the metals used
are difficult to detect by NMR, or even quench the signals of the standard nuclei, all
these precious pieces of mechanistic information could only be obtained through
molecular modeling. This approach has proved to be very powerful, even if we have
only used the implemented methods. To go further, it may become necessary to use
non-standard methodologies that would provide a more dynamic picture of the reaction
profiles, and I hope I will be able to participate in the development of such methods in
the future.

French Summary

La catalyse par les métaux du groupe principal est une stratégie efficace pour obtenir
de nouvelles réactivités et de nouvelles sélectivités en chimie organique, en particulier
dans les réactions de formation de liaisons carbone-carbone. Après une centaine
d’années de recherche, ce domaine est devenu un aspect essentiel de la synthèse
organique moderne et présente un large éventail d'applications en chimie médicinale,
agrochimie, matériaux et produits naturels. Parmi ces approches, les complexes de
gallium et de calcium en tant que catalyseurs acides de Lewis sont bien connus pour
leur grande réactivité vis-à-vis de l'activation des benzènes, des énynes, des groupes
hydroxyle, etc.


Le développement des réactions catalytiques par des acides de Lewis repose sur une
compréhension approfondie du modèle catalytique, du mécanisme de la réaction, de la
réactivité, de la sélectivité et des facteurs contrôlant la vitesse. Les ligands et contre-
ions, comme par exemple NTf2- ou PF6-, contribuent largement à contrôler la réactivité
et la sélectivité des processus catalysés par les métaux du groupe principal, tels que le
couplage catalysé par le calcium(II) d'alcools avec des acides vinylboroniques. En effet,
les modifications de la structure du ligand peuvent souvent conduire à un impact
significatif sur les propriétés stériques et électroniques, et par conséquent sur les
résultats de la réaction. Cependant, il reste difficile de bien comprendre les modèles
catalytiques uniquement à partir d'une intuition chimique, compte tenu de la complexité
des effets des ligands. En effet, de multiples facteurs (attraction d'électrons,
encombrement stérique, solubilité, etc.) peuvent intervenir au cours d’une réaction
catalysée par un acide de Lewis. Les études expérimentales des mécanismes de réaction
et des effets des ligands sont également souvent difficiles en à mettre en œuvre en raison
de la difficulté à caractériser les intermédiaires organométalliques réactifs à courte
durée de vie.

L'analyse par chimie théorique a été largement appliquée à presque tous les types de
réactions de formation de liaisons carbone-carbone catalysées par des acides de Lewis
pour prédire le chemin réactionnel le plus favorable, pour comprendre les effets des
ligands et des substituants et pour fournir des justifications plausibles pour concevoir
de nouveaux catalyseurs. Bien que les mécanismes de réaction de la plupart des
réactions catalysées par des acides de Lewis, comme illustré par la classique alkylation
de Friedel-Crafts du benzène médiée par GaCl3, soient bien acceptés, certains détails
comme le rôle des homodimères superélectrophiles ou l'existence d'intermédiaires tels
que le complexe de Wheland restent peu clairs. Au cours des dernières décennies, les
calculs à base de la théorie de la fonctionnelle de la densité (DFT) sont devenus un outil
important pour étudier le mécanisme des réactions catalysées par les acides de Lewis.
La procédure généralement acceptée pour explorer le mécanisme implique
l'optimisation des substrats de réaction et le calcul des énergies des intermédiaires et
des états de transition le long d'une coordonnée plausible de réaction pour construire un
profil énergétique. Classiquement, le mécanisme réactionnel proposé est construit par
des étapes élémentaires bien définies contenant diverses voies de réaction chimio-,
régio- et énantio-isomériques concurrentes. Les étapes déterminant la vitesse et la
sélectivité peuvent être déterminées en comparant les énergies libres de Gibbs calculées
de chaque voie concurrente. Les intermédiaires clés identifiés et les états de transition
sont ensuite analysés plus avant pour fournir une interprétation chimiquement
significative de la réactivité et de la sélectivité contrôlées par le ligand dans des
systèmes de réaction complexes et pour construire des modèles prédictifs pour la
conception de catalyseurs bien raisonnés.


Dans cette thèse de doctorat, je présente des études de chimie computationnelles sur la
méthylation du benzène catalysée par le gallium(III) (Chapitre 2), la réorganisation
squelettique catalysée par le gallium(III) des enynes (Chapitre 3) et les réactions de
couplage catalysées par le calcium(II) (Chapitre 4). Les objectifs généraux de mes
études incluent l'étude des mécanismes de réaction, l'analyse des effets des ligands et la
construction de modèles prédictifs.

Bien que la réaction de Friedel-Crafts ait été découverte il y a plus de 140 ans, son
mécanisme de réaction fait toujours débat. DeHaan, Brown et d'autres ont effectué un
grand nombre d'études cinétiques dans ce domaine. Ils ont rapporté que la loi de vitesse
de la méthylation catalysée par GaCl3 du benzène est -d[C6H6]/dt = k[C6H6][GaCl3]2.
Concernant le second ordre de GaCl3, le sujet du débat porte sur le rôle précis du
catalyseur dans cette réaction : est-ce un simple électrophile ? aide-t-il à la
déprotonation ? active-t-il le substrat sous des formes insoupçonnées (homodimère
superélectrophile, paire d'ions ou double activation) ? C'est le genre de questions que
nous avons essayé d'aborder en utilisant des techniques de calcul.


Un deuxième sujet de débat concerne la nature par étape ou concertée de la réaction de
Friedel-Crafts. S'agit-il d'un processus par étapes à travers un complexe de type
Wheland, comme indiqué dans n'importe quel manuel de chimie ? ou est-ce une
réaction concertée ? C'est l'un des sujets qui ne cessent d'être discutés et auxquels nous
avons essayé d'apporter une contribution.


Toutes les questions ci-dessus sont de bonnes raisons d'utiliser les calculs DFT pour
clarifier davantage les mécanismes de réaction.

synthons utiles. Dès 2002, Chatani et al. ont rapporté la réorganisation squelettique
catalysée par GaCl3 des enynes en 1-vinylcycloalcènes. Le mécanisme réactionnel qui
a été proposé lorsque GaCl3 est utilisé comme catalyseur n'est en fait pas très différent
de celui qui a été bien établi avec les complexes d’Au(I). Cependant, pour l'alcynophilie,
les caractéristiques typiques du complexe d’or(I) métal de transition tardif, ne peuvent
pas être utilisées pour expliquer les propriétés du sel GaCl3 dérivé d’un métal du groupe
principal. Cela soulève la question de savoir ce qui fait d'une espèce simple telle que
GaCl3 un bon acide de Lewis π alcynophile par rapport aux complexes de métaux de
transition tardifs tels que les espèces LAu(I)+, ou même par rapport à BCl3, AlCl3 ou
Ga(OTf)3 qui ne fonctionnent pas comme catalyseur pour la cycloisomérisation
d’énynes. En outre, le rôle possible des associations superélectrophiles nécessite
également une étude théorique plus approfondie.

Notre groupe a développé le couplage catalysé par le calcium d'alcools avec des acides
vinylboroniques en 2015 et 2017. Les alcools allyliques, benzyliques et propargyliques,
ainsi que les N,O-acétals ont été évalués comme substrats de réaction. Dans la réaction

rendement diminue en présence du sel d'ammonium nBu4NPF6. En revanche, aucun

réactionnelles possibles : a. Le métal active le groupe hydroxyle du substrat. b. L'acide
boronique active le groupe hydroxyle. c. Le calcium et l'acide de Lewis au bore activent
en synergie le groupe hydroxyle. d. Le sel de calcium active l'acide boronique, qui à
son tour active le groupe hydroxyle (activation superélectrophile). Sur la base des voies
de réaction ci-dessus, nous avons effectué des calculs théoriques pour mieux
comprendre un mécanisme impliquant deux métaux du groupe principal, tous deux
agissant probablement comme des acides de Lewis, et parfois un sel d'ammonium
comme activateur.

Abstract : DFT calculations were used to               (no Wheland type σ-complex). Secondly, this
study the methylation of benzene, the                  study answers why some group 13 MX3 salts
skeletal reorganization of 1,6-enynes, and             behave as soft π-Lewis acids towards
the coupling of alcohols with vinylboronic             enynes, while others remain inactive. The
acids, respectively catalyzed by main-group            mechanism       of       GaCl3-catalyzed          skeletal
metal salts of the gallium and calcium series.         reorganization of 1,6-enynes was calculated
Firstly, this work corroborates the role of the        towards this end. Finally, the mechanism of
superelectrophilic Ga2Cl6 homodimer as the             the Ca(II)-catalyzed coupling of alcohols
active    catalyst   in   the        GaCl3-catalyzed   with vinylboric acids was analyzed, also
