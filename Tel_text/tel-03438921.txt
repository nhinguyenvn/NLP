    Abstract:
    The Stirling cycle machine has many successful applications as                               and by reversing the model to work producing engine, so that
    a prime mover and cooling machine. The Stirling cycle heat                                   the validation could be made with different theoretical models
    engine has a good potential for use in the future because of                                 developed by other scholars so far. The validation results confirm
    some advantages like external combustion, and fuel flexibility.                              that the proposed numerical model could be used to design a
    The Stirling machine is used in cryogenics but applications for                              Stirling cycle refrigerating machine with reasonable accuracy. The
    domestic cooling are still underdeveloped. The main goal of this                             contribution of this study also includes investigation of the effect
    study is to develop a precise thermodynamic numerical model                                  of different working fluids (air, nitrogen, hydrogen and helium),
    that could predict the performances and provide means for further                            effects of losses (shuttle heat and mass leakage) that have a
    optimization. Hence, this dissertation presents the numerical                                direct effect on the operating condition of the cooling machine
    modeling, simulation, experimental validation, and parametric                                and parametric optimization. Air and nitrogen showed better
    optimization of an air-filled Beta type Stirling refrigerator for                            cooling performance than helium and hydrogen mainly due to
    domestic application.                                                                        the higher mass flow rate. The effects of incorporating shuttle
    The research shows that a non-ideal second-order numerical                                   heat loss in the differential equations on the temperature and
    model called the modified simple model has been developed. The                               pressure of working gas and the overall performance of the Stirling
    model incorporates effects of shuttle heat loss and mass leakage                             refrigerator are analyzed. Parametric optimization includes the
    loss to the buffer space directly to the differential equations of                           effect of operating (rotational speed, charging pressure, and
    pressure change, rate of change of mass of gas in compression                                temperature) and geometrical (phase angle, regenerator length,
    and expansion spaces, and mass flow rates across these working                               porosity, displacer height, displacer gap, piston-cylinder clearance
    spaces. Moreover, other power losses and heat losses are                                     gap, swept volume ratio, and piston diameter to stroke ratio)
    included as independent losses to evaluate the cooling production                            parameters on the cooling performance as well as on share of
    and associated COP. The model is simulated using MATLAB code                                 different power and heat losses. Finally, we propose a set of
    for Beta configuration FEMTO-60 Stirling engine operating as a                               parameters to optimize a refrigerating Stirling machine achieving
    refrigerator. The model is validated both with an experiment                                 a COP of 1.3 for a cooling power of 625 W at a temperature of
    conducted in the FEMTO-ST laboratory in refrigerating mode                                   −4o C.

This thesis becomes a reality with the kind support of many individuals. I would like to
extend my sincere thanks to all of them.
Foremost, I want to thank the almighty GOD for the wisdom he bestowed upon me, em-
powering and giving me internal courage and strength to accomplish this research.
I owe to express my sincere gratitude to my esteemed supervisor prof. François Lanzetta
for his kind and continuous support in providing technical and scientific guidance through-
out this research. Since the first day, I shook hands with him in Belfort train station, I have
continuously benefited a lot from his experience. It has been a great honor and real plea-
sure to work under his supervision as he was not only generous with his expertise but he
was also a good friend to me. I sincerely hope that he could enjoy our collaboration as
much as I did.
I am highly honored, also to appreciate my esteemed thesis co-supervisors Dr. Sylvie
Bégot and Dr. Bimrew Tamerate for their continuous support of my research, patience,
motivation, enthusiasm, and immense knowledge. Their guidance helped me in all the
time of research and writing of this thesis. It has been also a great honor and real pleasure
to work under their supervision as they were generous with their expertise and friendly to
work together. What I could generally say is that I was lucky enough to have them as my
supervisor and Co-supervisors.
I also thank EIPHI Graduate School (contract ANR−17−EURE−0002), Region Bourgogne-
Franche-Comte, Bahir Dar Institute of Technology, the Embassy of France to Ethiopia
and the African Union, and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Ethiopia for
sponsoring and facilitating my study.
Throughout the past three years, I have enjoyed the friendship and generous support of
Steve, Martin, Fatima, Isabelle, and other members of the FEMTO-ST laboratory. It will
be very hard to accomplish my task in France as I was new to the culture as well as to
the language. As the research has been conducted partially in Ethiopia, the community
of Bahir Dar institute of technology has also an important role in my research. Especially,
the long-lasting friendship, cooperation, and unreserved motivation and support from my
best friends Dessie Tarekegni and Muluken Temesgen was remarkable. I am very grateful
for all your support and encouragement.
Last but not list I would like to extend my thanks to all my family for your unconditional
love and motivation throughout my life. My beloved and supportive wife, Seblewongale
who is always by my side since the start of my PhD. It was a great moment having you
at the right time. You were with me at every moment and during this time you gave me a
very important gift, Yafet who is becoming the source of fun for our life. My beloved father
Mr. Zegeye Getie, my brothers Yirsaw, Abirham and...others you have a special place on

The rise of fuel and other energy resources price as well as global warming push scien-
tists to set the problem of searching innovative technologies for energy transformation, to
develop new technologies on the base of thermodynamic cycles with high efficiency, to
use new working mediums in order to develop ecologically safe energy systems, which
can satisfy residential and industrial sector utilities for a minimum amount of energy used.
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning systems are part of day to day life in the world in which
they are using energy to produce cold. They are definitely belonging to one of the most
important engineering achievements of the 20th century.
Food preservation, medicine storage and transportation, and industry would not be what
they are today without refrigeration. Refrigeration has had a large impact on industry,
lifestyle, agriculture, health care, and settlement patterns. The comfort, ease, and hap-
piness they bring to our everyday lives are endless. Air conditioning brings comfort and
environmental flexibility that has impacted people more than they realize. Refrigeration
is the process of removal of heat from an enclosed space to lower the temperature in
the region. The term refrigeration means cooling a space, substance or system to lower
and/or maintain its temperature below the ambient one and the removed heat is rejected
at a higher temperature. In other words, refrigeration is artificial (human-made) cooling.
Before mechanical refrigeration systems were introduced, ancient peoples, including the
Greeks and Romans, cooled their food with ice transported from the mountains. Refrig-
eration, especially at very low temperatures, has had an incredible impact on the medical
world.
The purpose of any refrigerator is to extract heat as much as possible from a cold reser-
voir with an expenditure of as little power as it could be. This implies that the power
requirement should be minimized for a given cooling load. Most of the refrigeration de-
mand of the world is largely dependent on the reverse-Rankine cycle particularly called
the vapor-compression refrigerator (VCR). VCR was first developed in the latter part of
the 19th century based on the phase change process of Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) or
hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) fluids. In a single-stage, VCR produces a cold end tem-
perature below 230 K, provided an appropriate refrigerant is used. The VCR currently
exists at the saturated technological level and is suited for household applications. Al-
though VCR is an efficient technology, especially for moderate temperature refrigeration
applications, its environmental concern resulted in different scenarios.

In the year 1987, a protocol was signed in U.K. with an objective to protect the ozone
layer from further depletion by CFC emission. This protocol is called Montreal protocol
and it stated that CFC group of refrigerants, which is the main culprit for ozone layer
depletion should be banned by the year 2010 [134]. The other related protocol signed in
the year 1997 called Kyoto protocol, aimed to prevent global warming due to the use of
HCFC/CFC refrigerants. Annual global direct and indirect CO2-equivalent emissions from
greenhouse gas emissions for residential and commercial air conditioning (A/C) systems
in 2010 is shown in Fig. 1.1.




Figure 1.1: Estimated global GHG emissions from air-conditioning systems in 2010 [97].

Now days, as a result of Montreal protocol, shifting of refrigerating gases from CFC to
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases and increased in demand of refrigeration have raised
the consumption of HFC gases. Global warming potential (GWP) of fluorinated-gases is
many times greater than that of carbon dioxide (CO2) [161]. Then, emissions of fluori-
nated greenhouse gases mainly HFC gases, which are used as replacements for ozone-
depleting substances (CFCs), have risen sharply since 1995. The rapid increase in HFC
gas emissions coupled with their global warming potential (GWP) has led to increased
worldwide attention to monitoring emission levels and subsequently regulating the use of
fluorinated-gases [156]. Several policies and regulations are being approved to control
the working fluids used in existing and future installations. The Kigali Amendment (KA)
to the Montreal Protocol agreed upon in October 2016 and which entered into force on 1
January 2019 is a global agreement to phase down and almost eliminate the consumption
of HFCs by 2050 [122].
The refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump industry is a significant contributor to the
climate change through its associated direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions [155]. The major share of fluorinated gases (about 99%) is used for refrigeration
and air conditioning systems, from the total consumption for cooing approximately 75%
of F-gases is used for refrigeration and stationary air conditioning and 25% is used in
mobile air conditioning [156].
Recently, in addition to the effort to improve the working condition of VCR through re-
placement of HFC gases, two global challenges (overall global warming and continued

increase in demand for refrigeration in almost all parts of the world) have pushed the en-
gineering community to search for alternatives to vapor-compression refrigeration. Non-
vapor compression technologies, at the intersection of better energy efficiency and GWP
reduction, provide potential value for both direct and indirect emissions reduction oppor-
tunities as one important piece of the long-term solution (see Fig 1.2). In consistent with
this, it is emphasized that the utilization of environmentally safe fluids and improved en-
ergy efficiency leads to a number of new refrigerants that are under consideration and
to the introduction of new technologies including Stirling refrigerators [21]. The Stirling
cycle refrigerating machine is a member of family of closed-cycle regenerative thermal
machines, including Stirling engine, heat pumps, and refrigerators and collectively known
as Stirling cycle machines. Stirling refrigerator is a reversed Stirling cycle or family of
gas cycle refrigerators. The working fluid is a gas that is compressed and expanded
but does not change phase in this Stirling cycle refrigerator. The development of Stir-
ling refrigerators for moderate temperature application is one of the technologies that
was brought from the concern about the use of CFC refrigerants and their effect on the
environment. These machines theoretically have the highest efficiency possible for any
practical thermodynamic system, and thus become a potential alternative to the existing
vapor-compression refrigeration system.

Refrigerators use mechanical energy to drive heat from a low-temperature source to a
high-temperature sink, and the Stirling machine is one of these which can be used for
this purpose. Stirling refrigerators are one type of mechanical refrigerators that have the
potential of being researched. The Stirling cycle machine uses mostly working fluids (air,
helium, hydrogen) contained in a closed system. Through reversing the cycle, the Stirling
engine can operate as a refrigerating machine or heat pump. The first mention of the
operation of the Stirling engine as a refrigerating machine dates back to J. Herschel’s
works in 1834, and the first refrigerating machine was built by Kirk in 1874 [1].

1.2/     M OTIVATION

In spite of great scientific strides over the last century, the most widely used refrigeration
technologies used today are the same as those used for the last century. Though Stirling
refrigerators were proposed since the mid-1800’s [15], they still have a limited com-
mercial use for domestic refrigeration and air-conditioning. The number of researches
made on Stirling refrigeration for domestic temperature (near to ambient) applications
are very few as compared to studies made about the Stirling engine and Stirling cry-
ocooler. A major reason for the limited researches in the area of Stirling refrigerators is
that vapor-compression refrigerators are already in use due to their better performance
and convenience as they approach perfect design conditions, and the necessity to de-
velop other refrigeration systems is limited if the GWP of refrigerants is not taken into
account. However, currently increasing public and government concern at the impact of
CFC/HCFC refrigerants on the ozone layer of the Earth has got attention to the search
for alternatives to the present vapor-compression refrigerating systems. This social con-
cern leads to unparalleled opportunities for the research and development of moderate
temperature Stirling cycle refrigerating machines for the application of household and
commercial purposes. Generally, the environmental concern on one side and the highest
theoretical coefficient of performance of reversed Stirling cycle on the other side as well
as the availability of limited researches on the area lead to the initiation of this research.
On the other hand, for Stirling refrigerators with moderate temperature, where there is
no need for high working temperature and pressure as that of Stirling engine, the mass
production cost could be reduced significantly and could easily be applied. Nowadays,
researches are conducted in this area and great promise in improvement of performance
has been recorded. Still, further engineering researches are needed to make such re-
frigerators sufficiently reliable, less expensive, and efficient to be used regularly for many
other potential application areas.

The thesis is divided into 5 chapters.
The first chapter gives a brief introduction to refrigeration technologies, motivation, objec-
tives of the thesis as well as the scope of the research.
Chapter two briefly presents the Stirling cycle refrigerating machine. In this chapter, the
working principle of the Stirling refrigerating machine, its configurations, driving mecha-
nisms, low-temperature Stirling cycle coolers, and moderate temperature Stirling refriger-
ating machine are reviewed. The review also tries to investigate the main thermodynamic
and parametric criteria as well as the modeling techniques that were considered to design
the refrigerating machine for different applications. Finally, research gaps are identified.

2.1/    I NTRODUCTION



Stirling cycle machine is a type of closed thermodynamic cycle machine invented in 1816
by Robert Stirling as a heat engine to convert thermal energy to mechanical energy. The
air was used as a working fluid to replace the steam engine since they were prone to life-
threatening explosions. The Stirling refrigerator, which is the counterpart of the Stirling
engine was first recognized in 1832 [6]. The system was practically realized in 1862 when
Alexander Kirk built and patented a closed cycle refrigerator based on Stirling cycle [1].
Until 1949, it was reported that very little development of Stirling refrigerators occurred,
when the Philips Company in Holland ran a Stirling engine in the reverse direction by
a motor and found that it liquefied air over the cold tip [2]. In the year 1971, Beale
stated that Stirling cycle machines could be used for both work producing or refrigerating
machines by reversing the cycle [8]. Therefore, Stirling cycle machine in this review is
mostly dedicated to Stirling cycle refrigeration machine [154].
Devices using the Stirling cycle are still expensive to construct due to limited production
volume and the working condition (high temperature and high pressure especially in case
of Stirling engine) that demands special materials and relatively high technology. Nu-
merous researches have been conducted on Stirling machines especially about Stirling
engines and Stirling cryocoolers for almost a century. The results reveal that the effi-
ciency and performance improvements have been recorded and are still showing great
improvement for Stirling engines and cryocoolers and wider applications are considered.
Cooling by using Stirling cycle machine is rarely used at moderate/ambient temperatures
for domestic or commercial refrigeration. On the other hand, for Stirling refrigerators with
moderate temperature, where there is no need for high working temperature and pres-
sure, the mass production cost can be reduced significantly as compared to a Stirling
engine.
A major reason for the limited application of Stirling refrigerators is that vapor
compression-type refrigerators, which are already functioning in household refrigerators,
approach very high performances conditions, and the necessity to develop other refrig-
eration systems is limited is the GWP of refrigerant is not taken into account. For this
reason, the number of researches conducted on the Stirling refrigeration for moderate
temperature (near to ambient) applications are very few as compared to studies made
about Stirling engine and Stirling cryocooler.

2.2/      C ONFIGURATION AND DRIVING MECHANISMS

2.2.1/     G ENERAL

The main parts of a Stirling cycle machine are the piston, the displacer, the cylinder, the
heat exchangers (heater, cooler and regenerator), and the crank mechanism as seen in
Fig. 2.1.

     • The heater, which must accept heat from a high temperature source and then trans-
       fer this heat to the engine working fluid .

     • The regenerator, which ideally stores the heat received when the hot working fluid
       flows from the hottest to the coldest space of the cycle, and then releases this stored
       heat during the reverse flow.The regenerator is the most important component of a
       Stirling engine. It is the heat exchanger in which the highest heat is transferred
       within a cycle.

     • The cooler that removes the heat in the cold side of the engine before the compres-
       sion of the working gas.

The systematic understanding of component configurations, common drive systems and
their possible combination for Stirling cycle refrigeration is vital to develop appropriate se-
lection criteria to use the machine for different applications. The Stirling cycle refrigerating
machine can be classified based on their piston-cylinder configurations or based on the
drive systems that ensure appropriate flow of working gas. Many different combinations
of configuration and driving mechanisms are proposed for different applications [144].
Therefore, in this part of the review, we try to go through the various common arrange-
ments of the Stirling cycle refrigeration systems and the associated researches done so
far.


2.2.2/     C ONFIGURATION

Stirling machines have a wide range of applications by varying their configuration. The
mechanical configurations of Stirling cycle refrigeration machines are exactly similar to
Stirling engine. Numerous designs of Stirling cycle machine exist but the following com-
mon elements shall be identified:

     • A closed system containing a fixed mass of gas.

     • Compression and expansion spaces with the volume of gas, which are controlled
       by a piston-cylinder arrangement. The enclosed working fluid flows in alternate
       directions between two interconnected gas spaces, at different temperatures, which
       is controlled by changing the succession volume.

     • A displacement arrangement to shuttle the working fluid back and forth between the
       hot end and cold end gas spaces.

     • A regenerator connecting the heater and cooler of the machine. The processes
       of heating and cooling are noticeably improved by the regenerator which generally
       consists of a matrix of fine wires or simply annular gaps made by winding foil.

     changer in case of refrigerating machines.

The basic parts of a Stirling cycle machine are the piston, the displacer, the cylinder vol-
umes, the heat exchangers, and the crank mechanism [109]. The Stirling cycle machines
are generally divided into three groups based on piston and piston/displacer-cylinder ar-
rangement such as the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma configurations [4, 18, 20]. All config-
urations are working with the same thermodynamic cycle but with different mechanical
design. The three configurations of the Stirling cycle machine could be described as:

 1. Alpha configuration: two pistons in separate cylinders connected in series by a
    heater, a regenerator and a cooler [55, 70, 77, 94, 129]. The configuration of Al-
    pha Stirling refrigerator is shown in Fig. 2.2. In this configuration, a displacer is
    not used. Both pistons need to transfer work and the piston-cylinder contact space
    is sealed to maintain the working gas at relatively higher pressure. The two pis-
    tons are arranged to move uniformly in the same direction and provide constant-
    volume heating or cooling processes of the working fluid. Based on different drive
    mechanisms, Stirling machines with Alpha configuration are found more suitable for
    medium and high-temperature difference applications [144]. Similarly, it is reported
    that Alpha type engine configurations are not suitable for low-temperature difference
    (LTD) applications [80]. This is because there is a direct relation between the op-
    timum compression ratio and the temperature ratio and Alpha configuration Stirling
    machines have higher compression ratio.

 2. Beta configuration: unlike the Alpha configuration, the Beta configuration Stirling

     machine has a single power piston and a displacer enclosed within a single cylin-
     der [44, 105, 130]. A Beta configuration Stirling refrigerator is shown in Fig. 2.3.
     The main task of the displacer is to displace the working fluid and shuttle it be-
     tween the compression space and the expansion space through the series of heat
     exchangers. From the patent drawing of 1816, it is shown that the Stirling machine

     Beta configuration Stirling machines could be used conveniently from low to high-
     temperature differential applications according to different drive mechanisms with
     the crank drives more preferred from low to moderate temperature and rhombic
     drive mechanism more applicable from moderate to the high-temperature differ-
     ence. This due to the fact that Beta configuration have relatively moderate com-

     is reported that only Gamma configurations are suitably applicable for low and very
     low-temperature differential applications [80, 144] due to lower compression ratio

2.2.3/   D RIVING   MECHANISMS

To ensure the appropriate flow of working gas for the complete Stirling cycle, different
types of drive systems are identified. According to the different configurations of the ma-
chine and to facilitate movement of the gas in the system, Stirling refrigerating machines
are classified into kinetic, free-piston, pulse tube/thermoacoustic and liquid piston types.
Among these drive systems, the first three types are the most commonly used at the
different stages of the refrigeration system and discussed as follows:

   • Kinetic driven mechanism: in kinetic drive mechanisms, the mechanical piston and
     piston/displacer are driven by kinetic drive mechanisms such as the simple crank-
     slider, Ross-yoke, rhombic drives, swash-plate and others as shown in the Fig. 2.5.
     The movement of the working gas in the Stirling machine is controlled by these
     mechanisms. The drive system is designed in such a way that the piston at the cold
     end should always move leading the piston in the hot end. All kinematic Stirling
     machines, no matter what the arrangements are, face several significant engineer-
     ing design challenges which may affect the effective application to any commercial
     success. Mechanical friction may be one challenge. The crank driven Stirling re-
     frigerator with a Beta configuration is shown in Fig. 2.6.

       kinematic Stirling machine, in the year 1964 William Beale invented the free-piston
       Stirling engine (FPSE) [7]. The mechanical pistons do not have any mechanical
       linkages therefore the crank mechanism is eliminated (see Fig. 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9)
       and replaced by gas springs and metallic springs in the free-piston Stirling machine
       [10]. The movements of the pistons are self adapted to the required conditions
       by using appropriate piston-spring resonant mechanisms or pneumatic force. The
       thermodynamic process is strongly coupled to the piston-spring pneumatic force
       action. It is simple, compact and long life but it has some limitations such as a
       less predictable motion of moving parts and performance. Small free-piston Stirling
       refrigerators are widely used for the cooling of cryogenic infrared sensors.

    refrigerator, the mechanical displacer is removed and oscillating gas flow in the thin
    tube produces cooling. This phenomenon is called pulse tube action. In the pulse
    tube refrigerator, the displacer is eliminated and replaced by a pulse tube as shown
    in the Fig. 2.10. The proper gas motion in phase with the pressure is achieved
    by using phase shifters, such as orifice-reservoir, inertance tube, active displacer,

       tion occurs in it during the oscillating flow. The oscillating flow through the orifice
       acts as displacer in separating the heating and cooling spaces. For large indus-
       trial systems, the mechanical compressor is replaced with thermoacoustic drivers
       to give a refrigerator with negligible moving parts. The first pulse tube refrigerator
       was discovered accidentally at Syracuse University in the mid-1960s [5].

2.3/      OVERVIEW OF S TIRLING REFRIGERATING MACHINE

A Stirling cycle refrigerating machine consists of two variable volumes (compression and
expansion) spaces at different temperatures and physically separated by the regenerator.
The presence of an economizer called the regenerator grouped Stirling cycle machine
as a regenerative machine. The working gas is alternatively compressed and expanded
by the power piston, while the displacer shuttles the gas back and forth between the
cold end, where heat is absorbed, and the warm end, where heat is rejected. When
the Stirling-cycle machine operates as a refrigerating machine, heat is lifted from the
cold zone during the expansion process and rejected to the hot heat exchanger duing
compression process as shown in Fig. 2.11. The work of expansion is lower than the
work of compression. Therefore, the net work input is needed in the refrigeration cycle
to compensate for the compression work. The cooling effect is shown in the expansion
space (see Fig. 2.12).
An ideal Stirling refrigeration cycle consists of four separate thermodynamics processes

which are explained as follows (see also Fig. 2.13):

 1. Isothermal compression (process 1-2): the working gas is compressed by the com-
    pression piston isothermally at the hot end, hence rejecting heat to the hot space
    called warm (hot) heat exchanger.

 2. Constant volume heat rejection (process 2-3): both pistons or a piston and a dis-
    placer move together to transfer all the working gas to the cold end of the refrigera-
    tor(expansion space) isochorically through the Stirling regenerator. Heat is rejected
    from the gas to the regenerator matrix as it passes through the regenerator, thus

      lowering the temperature of the gas to that of the cold space. Heat is stored in the
      regenerator matrix.

 3. Isothermal expansion (process 3-4): the low-pressure working gas expands isother-
    mally at cold end temperature, hence absorbing heat from the cold space via the
    cold heat exchanger called chiller.

 4. Constant volume heat addition (process 4-1): both pistons or a piston and a dis-
    placer move together to transfer all the working gas to the hot end of the Stirling
    refrigerator (compression space) isochorically through the regenerator. Heat is re-
    stored to the gas from the regenerator matrix as it passes through the regenerator,
    thus raising the temperature as well as the pressure of the gas to that of the hot
    space and the cycle returns again to its initial position.

The surface delimited by the cycle represents the amount of net work input which must
be provided to the refrigerating machine.
The PV diagram of actual Stirling cooler is different from the ideal cycle (seen in Fig. 2.13).
The working volume of most real Stirling machines follow sinusoidal variation based on
the configuration and drive mechanisms. A 100 W capacity beta-type Stirling cycle cooler
designed, experimentally tested and the actual PV diagram of the operation have been
constructed [44]. The particular PV diagram for this Stirling cooler at a frequency of 13.3
Hz, cold head temperature of 233 K, and hot heat temperature of 303 K is shown in
Fig. 2.14.
The major components of the Stirling machine are presented as shown in Fig. 2.1 and
the motion of piston and piston/displacer with respect to time results in variation of the
volume of the two working spaces (compression space and expansion space) as seen in
the Fig. 2.15.

According to the classical theory of thermodynamics, the performance of a Stirling cycle
machine is a function the following independent parameters [20, 18, 13]:

   • Pressure of the working fluid.

   • Speed of the machine.

   • Phase angle between piston and displacer.


20                                                  CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW


     • Ratio of the temperatures (compression and expansion temperatures).

     • Ratio of the swept volumes.

     • Volume and efficiency of the regenerator and heat exchangers.


Hence, the effects of such parameters have to be evaluated. Practically, the parameters
phase angle, ratio of temperature, ratio of swept volume and volume of the heat exchang-
ers must be selected at the design stage of the Stirling cycle machine.
Heat is transferred in or out of the working fluid in the Stirling cycle refrigerators during
all four phases of their operation, and their performance depends on the non-isothermal
heat exchanges performed reversibly or irreversibly. It should also be noted that the
regenerator is one of the most important components in a Stirling refrigerator. Namely,
the regenerator is typically the largest source of power loss in the system, due to friction
losses, imperfect solid-gas heat transfer, and axial heat conduction [103].

2.4.1/    G ENERAL

The design and development of Stirling cycle refrigerators require an understanding of
the processes that govern the operation of the machine. Thermodynamic models enable
either to simulate the working processes within the Stirling machine or to optimize the size
of components of the machine such as cylinder volumes, heat exchangers dimensions,
regenerator, and piston and phase angle. This has promoted the development of different
analysis methods with different modeling methods. Different modeling methods have
different accuracy levels. The analysis methods for the Stirling machine can be classified
with different criteria. The criteria adopted in this research include a variety of Stirling
machine models and are based on the previous reviews [11, 16, 18, 49, 128, 139].
According to these criteria, the modeling techniques could be characterized into zero-
order, first order, second order, third order, and fourth order.
In general, the Stirling machine modeling techniques could also be grouped into three
levels of modeling based on their degree of complexity. These are:


     • Ideal analysis estimates which may include zero-order and first-order models [38,
       67, 128].

     • The decoupled (second-order) analysis takes the outcomes of the ideal analysis
       and improves the result, considering a selected number of main losses [65, 87, 89,
       141, 159].

     • The coupled analysis includes third and four order models and is based on a fine
       discretization of the machine in different control volumes with all the main losses
       [96, 106].

2.4.2/   Z EROTH -O RDER M ODELS

Empirical correlations are used to estimate the output of a machine in the zero-order
models considering the overall size of the Stirling machine. These zero-order models
are models based on experimentation and the empirical findings from experiments of the
Stirling engine [49]. The recommended way of estimating the power output of the Stirling
engine is to use the Beale number method that shows the power output is proportional to
the mean working pressure, operating operating frequency and volume of the machine as
described by Walker [13]. These types of models are usually used by engine designers
as a way of quickly estimating the power output for a set of specified parameters of the
engine [16].
The zero-order methods cannot be used for designing a new machine and calculating the
work and heat of the machine. They give quick overview of the overall performance and
enable to compare different technologies and machines.


2.4.3/   F IRST-O RDER    OR APPROXIMATE DESIGN METHODS


First-order models also called approximate design methods are the simplest mathemat-
ical models. These models are used for a simplified and quick way of initial Stirling ma-
chine analysis and performance estimation [16]. The technique starts the calculation
of the cyclic power output with the assumption of idealized loss-free isothermal analy-
sis, and then a generalized correction factor that accounts for all the losses is applied to
calculate the estimated performance output. These performance correction factors are
determined from experience with a real machine. The first analysis of this kind was done
by Gustav Schmidt in 1871 for the case of sinusoidal volume variations in the expansion
and compression spaces [49].
Although the first-order models provide a way of estimating Stirling machine performance
(power output and cycle efficiency in case of the engine and cooling power and coefficient
of performance (COP) in case of cooling), they cannot be used as detailed design meth-
ods. Therefore, these methods are traditionally believed satisfactory only in evaluating
the feasibility of employing a Stirling machine for a given temperature range.


2.4.4/   S ECOND -O RDER      MODELS OR DECOUPLED METHODS


The second-order models begin with a simplified cycle analysis for the estimation of the
cyclic power and heat energy interactions. The cycle analyses are typically classified as
being either ideal-isothermal or ideal-adiabatic, different in the way in which heat transfer
is modelled for the expansion and compression space volumes. The modeling accuracy
improved further as they include the different losses existing in the process in these mod-
els. The major improvements of these second-order models, compared to the first-order
design techniques is that individual losses and their mechanisms are identified and de-
termined. Heat energy losses include regenerator imperfection loss, shuttle heat losses,
and conduction due to temperature difference. Power losses include fluid friction losses in
heat exchangers, mechanical friction loss, and (hysteresis) losses. The energy losses are
assumed to be decoupled from one another in all second-order models. Several authors
use this analysis [20, 65, 73, 80, 87, 89, 141, 159].

Second-order modeling methods are further subdivided into three classes according to
the way the expansion and compression spaces are handled in the analysis. They are
modelled as either being isothermal, adiabatic, or semi-adiabatic [16]. These analysis
techniques were derived according to the heat transfer rate between machine the cylin-
der wall and working fluids. If heat transfer rate between cylinder wall and working fluid
is assumed infinite, it is called isothermal, if the rate of heat transfer is zero, it is called
adiabatic and on the other hand it is called semi-adiabatic if the heat transfer rate is
assumed finite. Isothermal model considers the system divided into 3 volumes: compres-
sion volume, regenerator and expansion volumes. So during compression and expansion
process there are heat exchange simultaneously which lead to isothermal processes by
temperature compensation. As a more realistic approximation to modeling the Stirling
cycle, the ideal-adiabatic cycle analysis, that assumes the compression and expansion
spaces are perfectly insulated surfaces [3]. The external heat transfer occurs only in the
heater and cooler sections.
It has been suggested that the standard Stirling cycle model should be the second-order
adiabatic model, as the working spaces in actual Stirling machines are adiabatic and not
isothermal [20]. The second-order models present a reasonable accuracy with a fast
solution and thus became appropriate for fast design stages and optimization studies.
Generally, the second-order models are numerical zero-dimensional models that have
sufficient accuracy for most cases. Moreover, they can be easily applied to various Stirling
engines/coolers. In other words, second-order models can be utilized to simulate every
type of Stirling engines/coolers with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, due to
much lower computation time compared to third-order models, these models can be used
easily for design and optimization purpose.

Third-order analysis techniques increased the level of complexity and the accuracy of
prediction of outputs in the models. Third-order modeling, also known as nodal analysis,
follows three basic steps. These are:

     • The Stirling machine is divided into control volumes or network of nodes.

     • The differential equations of energy, mass, and momentum conservation, along with
       the equations of state are written for each control volume.

     • The differential equations are solved simultaneously using numerical methods is
       conducted [16]. All of the third-order model analysis methods use finite difference
       of the spatial derivatives to convert the partial differential equations to a system of
       ordinary differential equations (with only time derivatives remaining).

Using the numerical solutions in this third-order modeling, it is possible to determine
instantaneous velocity, pressure and temperature of the working fluid at each working
space (compression and expansion chambers and the heat exchangers). These analy-
ses describe more precisely thermal and hydrodynamic processes that take place in the
Stirling engines [58, 151].
Generally, the third-order models can also be based on the Computational Fluid Dynam-
ics (CFD). In this case third-order models suffer from some limitations, including the high

computational cost and the lack of generality that makes it impossible to be used to sim-
ulate every type of the engine. Instead, the third-order models should be developed for a
specific type of engine, and the results cannot be extended to other engines.


2.4.6/    M ETHOD    OF CHARACTERISTICS

The method of characteristics solves systems of nonlinear partial differential equations of
hyperbolic type by determining characteristic curves for the equations. The characteristics
curves are used to transform the partial differential equations into a system of ordinary
differential equations that are valid only along the characteristic curves. Little has been
done on this level of analysis. This is because the third-order analysis is faster and for the
most part has been an adequate engineering tool. However, to improve efficiency further
it is capable of determining flow losses and pressure drops and it can show exactly how
the gas is heated up and cooled down and helps to make heat exchangers more efficient
by optimizing flow conditions, pressure drops and heat transfer [49]. This method has
been used successfully in the study of compressible gas flow and has been applied to
the analysis of one-dimensional, unsteady flow in the Stirling machine.



2.5/     R EVIEWS ON S TIRLING CRYOCOOLERS ( LOW TEMPERATURE )

2.5.1/    G ENERAL

In the previous years, the cryocoolers with Stirling cycle advanced rapidly because of
their high efficiency, low power consumption, light weight, small size, fast cool-down, and
high reliability etc. Because of the increasing demand for cryogenic temperatures below
120 K since the middle of the 20th century, lots of studies were conducted and resulted
in a wide variety of application areas. The major applications of cryocoolers for several
years were used for the military to cool infrared sensors to about 80 K and for tactical
uses in tanks, airplanes and missiles [40]. The high capacity cryocooler working below
30 K cooling temperature finds lots of applications including superconducting motors, su-
perconducting cables, and cryopumps. The cryocooler technology is extremely applied
in energy, medical, and aerospace areas [51, 60, 69, 104]. This is mainly fostered with
the advancement of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) materials and technological
advancement. The requirements imposed in each of the above listed applications have
been difficult to meet and have been the motivation for considerable research and devel-
opment in the area of cryocoolers since the past decades. Different kinds of cryocoolers
are frequently experimented in laboratories and resulted in continual improvements in
the performance and reliability and implementation for commercial and space applica-
tions [72].
It is reported that the gas cycle refrigeration systems, including the Stirling refrigerator,
has the highest cycle efficiency at lower source temperatures [29]. This argument leads
to the fact that Stirling cycle refrigeration is more effective for cryogenic applications. This
is because in Stirling coolers low temperatures could be obtained rapidly, which increases
its effectiveness as compared to other alternative refrigerating technologies. Stirling re-
frigerators are well established in the cryogenic temperature range and found to be the
system of choice in the miniature closed cycle. Stirling cycle machines are used for

cryogenic applications with the cooling capacities ranging from fractions of a watt to 30
kW and in further research their performance and cooling range have been improved
for the last decades. The landscape shown in Fig. 2.16 demonstrates the temperature
and cooling power capabilities of available technologies with the temperature and cool-
ing requirements of various applications that operate at cryogenic temperatures [74]. It
shows the temperature and cooling power capabilities of available technologies and over-
lays with the temperature and cooling requirements of various applications that operate
at cryogenic temperatures. The working fluid is invariably gaseous with hydrogen and
helium gases as the more preferred fluids because of their favorable thermodynamic and
transport properties.

The kinematic Stirling cryocoolers driven by crank-shaft mechanisms can generate a
higher system efficiency [125]. This cooler was designed for a cooling capacity of 4
W and to operate at cryogenic temperatures of 77 K. Stirling refrigerators have been put
to practical use in the fields of superconduction and space engineering for low cooling
capacity cryocoolers, in order to obtain temperatures in the range of 10-15 K [44]. It is
reported that mechanical cryocoolers represented a significant enabling technology for
NASA’s earth and space science enterprises [60].
Researchers applied different analysis techniques to design the Stirling cryocoolers and
come up with different results. Microcomputer simulation for Stirling cryocoolers was de-

veloped using isothermal assumption in compression and expansion volumes [22]. The
performance of Stirling cryocoolers has been analyzed by considering an adiabatic model
for compression and expansion spaces [23]. It is reported that the Stirling cryocool-
ers are divided and studied as either fully isothermal (for constant volume process) or
fully adiabatic (compression space and expansion space) and a numerical model was
developed [31]. Narasaki et al. [51] developed a two-stage Stirling cryocooler and exper-
imented it for an infrared astronomical satellite. The researchers reported the design of
the cooler and the experimental results including cooler performance, vibration, thermal
vacuum, and lifetime tests. The Stirling cycle cryocooler with a low-cost, high-capacity
was studied to meet different cryogenic system applications [95]. In the study, a cold end
temperature near to 50 K was reported.
In the year 2002, Tyagi et al. [46] applied the concept of finite-time thermodynamics to
study the effect of internal and external irreversibility for Stirling and Ericsson refrigerator
at different operating conditions. Further, the researchers developed a thermo-economic
optimization mode in the year 2004, to maximize the cooling load per unit cost of the sys-
tem using finite time thermodynamics for an irreversible Stirling cycle cryogenic refrigera-
tor [53]. In this research, the authors considered external irreversibilities due to the finite
temperature difference between the system and the external reservoirs and the internal
irreversibilities caused by the regenerative heat loss. A high power Stirling cryocooler has
been analyzed through a numerical simulation using the SAGE software [98] and a result
showed the cold head could reach a no-load cooling temperature of 38 K and a cooling
capacity of 1012 W at 77.35 K with a power supply of 7.72 kW. A mathematical model
has been developed based on thermodynamic theory to evaluate the lifetime of the split
Stirling refrigerator [91]. In the same year, Stirling cryogenic refrigerator cycles were ana-
lyzed including both internal and external irreversibilities by a multi-objective optimization
technique [87]. The optimization work includes reduction of the input power with maxi-
mization of the cooling load and the coefficient of performance (COP). Li and Gorsu [132]
developed an isothermal model for a Stirling cryocooler by considering various losses
at the same time. A high cooling capacity single-stage Stirling cryocooler driven by the
kinetic driving system was developed and studied systematically [140]. The researchers
found a cooling capacity of 700 W at 77 K and a relative Carnot efficiency of 18.2 % as
shown in Fig. 2.17. A CFD model has been developed and validated using experimental
work, to investigate the effect of various parameters for the purpose of developing an ef-
ficient miniature alpha type Stirling cooler capable of cooling to a temperature lower than
−40 oC [129].
The effect of operational and geometrical parameters on the performance of the cooler
has been studied by different researchers and the associated losses were described. Nie
et al. [71] pointed out that in the micro/nano scaled Stirling refrigeration devices, the sur-
face area of the system (boundary) has a major effect on the refrigeration heat and COP
that in addition to other parameters. An optimal performance of regenerative cryocoolers
have been analyzed by considering the losses due to imperfect regeneration and viscous
dissipation in the year 2011 [81]. Results revealed that optimum performance could be
found at large warm space to the regenerator void volumes ratio. Li and Grosu [132]
investigated the effects of various parameters on cooling performance of the Stirling cry-
ocooler and found that the biggest heat loss was due to conduction loss and the biggest
work loss was due to the mechanical friction loss. The researchers also described the
trend of the input power, cooling power, and COP variation with the phase shift between
displacer and piston as seen in Fig. 2.18. The parametric study confirmed that a phase

The free piston configuration, which was initially designed by W. Beale in the late 1960’s,
is one of the most novel applications of the Stirling cycle machine [7]. Ackermann [14]
described the phasor analysis to analyze and understand the operation of free-piston Stir-
ling cryocoolers. Park et al. [45] tested the performance of free piston/free displacer type

Stirling cryocoolers and investigated the effect of operating parameters on the cooling
performance. In the year 2003, the authors further evaluated the effect of the phase shift
between the piston and displacer through experiments [48]. [47] conducted a dynamic
analysis of small free-piston-type Stirling refrigerator to understand the characteristics
of the refrigerator using an isothermal thermodynamic model. A two-dimensional ax-
isymmetric Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed to characterize
the thermodynamic losses for cryocooler application [62]. Theoretical and experimental
studies were conducted to evaluate the phase shift characteristics including displace-
ment, pressure and expansion phase difference for free piston and free displacer Stirling
cryocooler [68]. Due to its attractive virtue of compact size and having high thermal effi-
ciency, the free piston Stirling cryocooler (FPSC) was reported a good candidate for high
cooling capacity ranging from 80 K to 120 K applications [99].
In recent years, many researches have been conducted on high-capacity single-stage
free piston Stirling cryocoolers. These cryocoolers could supply several hundred watts of
cooling power at around 77 K, but the lowest temperature is difficult to reach. A numerical
model was developed based on the thermoacoustic principle to optimize a two-stage free
piston Stirling cryocooler system which could operate below 30 K [110]. The researcher
reported that a cooling power of 141 W at 77 K in the first stage and 60 W cooling power at
30 K in the second stage were achieved simultaneously using PV power of about 2.23 kW.
Experimental work was conducted on a two-stage free piston Stirling cooler so as to fulfill
the necessity of the high temperature superconductor (HTS) motor applications [126]. A
lowest cold head temperature of 27.6 K was reported with an input electric power of 3.12
kW and a mean pressure of 2.58 MPa.
A new concept that uses a pair of metal diaphragm was proposed to seal and suspend
the displacer for free-piston Stirling cryocooler using SAGE modeling tools and a pro-
totype was constructed [114]. The researcher achieved a cryogenic temperature and
reported a no-load temperature of 56 K and a cooling load of 29 W at 77 K. Caughley et
al. [113] constructed CFD model as a tool to understand the underlying fluid dynamics
and heat transfer mechanisms that happened inside a diaphragm Stirling Cryocooler with
the aim to improve the performance. The results of CFD analysis showed good agree-
ment with experimental values and also highlighted possible areas of improvement such
as increasing the length of the warm heat exchanger to achieve relatively better cooling
performance. Furthermore, the model showed that the gas was found the coldest and at
the highest velocity in the center of the expansion space.

The basic Pulse tube refrigerator was first described with experimental models in the year
1964 [5]. After it was first perceived in the mid-1960s, pulse tube refrigerator has been
an academic interest until the middle of 1980s as the demand for cryogenic temperature
steadily increases [40]. Since then, improvements in its efficiency have been increased
rapidly. Mikulin et al. [19] included an orifice tube inside the pulse tube close to the warm
end and obtained a cooling temperature of 105 K. Shaowei et al. [24] introduced the con-
cept of double Inlet Pulse tube refrigerator. Mathematical investigation and experimental
findings have confirmed that the double inlet pulse tube cooler has higher performance as
compared with the orifice pulse tube refrigerator. It was reported that on the heels of basic
research, commercial developers are harnessing acoustic processes in gases to make

reliable, inexpensive engines and cooling devices with no moving parts and a significant
fraction of Carnot’s efficiency [32]. Since there is no or only one moving part in pulse tube
refrigerators, the different arrangements of these refrigerators such as an orifice, double
inlet, and inertance tube, pulse tube refrigerators were considered as superior to most
other Stirling refrigerators [19, 24, 27, 54].
The performance of a pulse tube expander was experimentally investigated [43]. Tward
et al. [52] developed a high capacity miniature pulse tube cryocooler which could pro-
vide large cooling power for space application over a range of temperatures. Based on
efficiency, maintainability, operational flexibility, the feasibility of integration and perfor-
mance/cost ratio criterion, pulse tube refrigerator was found to be applicable for HTS
from 20 K to 77 K temperature ranges [50]. Zia [57] described the rapid evolution of pulse
tube cryocooler from a laboratory-based prototype to a commercial offering that produces
cooling of 200 W at 80 K.
Yuan et al. [56] developed a thermodynamic model for single stage Stirling type pulse
tube cooler and constructed a prototype for experimentation. The researchers’ test result
showed the cooler reached a lowest no-load temperature of 37 K within 30 minutes and
a cooling capacity of 50 W at 55 K with an input power of 3.4 kW. The researchers
further reported that at 80 K of cooling temperature, 11% Carnot efficiency has been
obtained. The design and fabrication of large capacity, single stage, Stirling type, Pulse
tube refrigerator(PTR) was developed followed by a sequence of design modifications
which have been focused on the optimization of the flow transition [59].
An experimental investigation was conducted and a numerical model was developed us-
ing the SAGE software to understand the origin of parasitic streaming in the regenerator
of Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler [61]. Zhu et al. [79] introduced a nodal numerical
model for the simulation of the pulse tube Stirling machine. It has been reported that
two single-stage high-frequency coaxial PTCs, with each of them reaching a cooling tem-
perature lower than 30 K and input power of less than 250 W have been designed and
tested [78]. It has been further explained that for single stage PTC, optimization with
both double-inlet and inertance tube is of crucial to achieving temperature below 30 K. A
single-stage high-frequency multi-bypass pulse tube cryocooler(PTC) was designed and
experimentally tested [84]. The researchers reported that a single-stage multi-bypass
PTC achieved the lowest temperature of 18.6 K with an input power of 268 W, and it was
the lowest temperature reported so far with single stage PTC. In the same year, the au-
thor designed and tested a single stage Stirling type pulse-tube cryocooler by optimizing
the regenerator and a new lower temperature of 15.5 K has been recorded [85]. The new
optimized design was reported as it could deliver a cooling power of 386 mW at 20 K
for an input power of 246 W which was found to be comparable to the two-stage Stirling
pulse tube cryocooler with the same input power.
A three stages high frequency pulse tube cryocooler (HPTC) has been developed, and
a no-load temperature of 3.6 K has been reported using helium-4 as working gas [142].
The temperature found from the research has been reported as the lowest temperature
found for high frequency pulse tube cryocooler. The researcher has made four improve-
ments (on compressor, regenerator material, intertance tube and on cold inlet structure)
to optimize the design. [119] designed a pulse tube cryocooler to suit the demands of
small liquid natural gas (LNG) distribution stations which could work at a temperature of
120 K, cooling power of 1.2 KW and a relative Carnot efficiency greater than 20 %. The
researchers pointed out that one-third of the acoustic work is dissipated in the inertance

tube and resulted in efficiency deterioration.
Zhou et al. [111] developed a high frequency coaxial single stage like structure and multi-
bypass PTR which could achieve a no-load temperature of 13.9 K at an input power of
250 W. [127] established a two-dimensional axis-symmetric CFD model of a miniature
coaxial Stirling pulse tube cooler. A numerical simulation was conducted for an inertance
tube PTR by removing the dissipative inertance tube and reservoir and replacing a mass-
spring displacer directly coupled to a compression space with an objective of recovering
power dissipated [124]. From the simulation result, researchers concluded that the COP
could be significantly improved due to the extra power recovered by the mass-spring dis-
placer. Theoretical analyses and modeling were conducted to evaluate the dynamic and
thermodynamic characteristics of moving-coil linear compressor in the inertance tube Stir-
ling pulse tube cryocooler [116]. The researchers deduced the characteristics governing
equations. To verify the theoretical analyses and modeling conducted [116], experimen-
tal investigations were carried out in the same year [117]. A better efficient cascade
cryocooler was analyzed and experimentally tested, that is capable of recovering most
of the expansion work wasted as heat in a pulse-tube cryocooler [140]. A modified type
pulse tube refrigerator was proposed numerically to reduce the direct current gas losses
that could have an impact on cooling power in the orifice type pulse tube refrigerator by
introducing an additional compressor [135].
The effect of the regenerator and pulse tube length on the efficiency of a pulse tube
cryocooler was analyzed [92]. The effects of geometrical parameters of the linear com-
pressor on the performances of Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler were mathematically
investigated and some experimental work was performed [117]. Tang et al. [138] ana-
lyzed a double-inlet pulse tube refrigerator focusing on the interaction between Gedeon
streaming and the local temperature. Experimental work was conducted and a 32 %
cooling efficiency improvement was found for a cascade cryocooler as compared with a
traditional single-stage pulse-tube cryocooler [140]. In the report on these cascade pulse
tube cryocoolers, the second stage cooler covered around 18.1 % of the overall cooling
power. A cold end temperature of 98 K was achieved by a modified pulse tube refrigerator
based on the CFD simulation [135], whereas a simple orifice type pulse tube refrigerator
with the same dimension reached a cold end temperature of 130 K.
Hu et al. [92] reported that the pulse tube cryocooler could offer 520 W of cooling power at
a cooling temperature of 80 K with a relative Carnot efficiency of 18.2%. Zhou et al. [111]
developed a pulse tube refrigerator that could be a potential choice especially for small
cooling loads at a low temperature such as 31.3 K and 20 K for 50 W and 100 W power
inputs respectively. Zhao et al. [127] analyzed and calculated the different types of re-
generator losses, and reported that the pressure drop is dominant for most regenerator’s
length and decrease monotonously from warm space to cold space. Double-inlet pulse
tube refrigerator was simulated to analyze the impact of Gedeon streaming on the effi-
ciency of the machine [138]. The short summary of research findings about Stirling cycle
cryocooler is shown in Table 2.1.

2.6/    R EVIEWS ON MODERATE TEMPERATURE S TIRLING REFRIG -
        ERATING MACHINE


Due to its adiabatic behavior, Stirling machine was generally considered as less effi-
cient for small temperature differences between the compression and expansion side.
However, STM has discovered ways to improve the efficiency considerably [30]. A pro-
totype free-piston Stirling refrigerator intended for domestic cooling was experimentally
tested and results were reported [25]. Gauger [29] reported that the gas cycle refrigera-
tion systems including the Stirling refrigerator have the highest cycle efficiency at lower
source temperatures. Berchowitz [26] discussed the impact of irreversibilities for mod-
erate temperature Stirling refrigerating machine with reference to the machine design.
The researcher reported the configuration of free-piston Stirling cycle refrigerating ma-
chine resulted in better performance than the crank driven Stirling refrigerating machine.


2.6. REVIEWS ON MODERATE TEMPERATURE STIRLING REFRIGERATING MACHINE31


The free piston Stirling refrigeration machines were found superior to the vapor com-
pression refrigeration machine for domestic purpose [28, 115]. The researchers further
described that the FPSCs are far more superior than the VCR in their respective COP.
Berchowitz [28] explained the development of free-piston Stirling refrigeration machine
would continue with noticeable achievements and they are expected to meet or exceed
the life time and reliability expectations of ordinary refrigerators while being cost compet-
itive. Based on the optimization work conducted in the year 1996, it was found that the
free-piston Stirling coolers together with super insulated cabinets and cold stores offer an
ideal combination for practical photovoltaic powered refrigerators [33].
The impact of finite-rate heat transfer and regenerative losses on Stirling refrigerators
cooling performance was investigated [34]. A finite time heat transfer analysis was also
conducted in the year 1998 for an air refrigeration cycle with non-isentropic compression
and expansion [37]. The researcher derived the relation between COP and cooling load
with pressure ratio. Chen [36] developed an irreversible cycle model to predict the perfor-
mance and the input power required for the Stirling refrigerator optimized on a specified
cooling capacity. Some dimensionless parameters have been proposed to link the entropy
variation rate and the temperature differences at the heat exchangers for an irreversible
refrigerator [90].
Researches were conducted on an optimal relation between the cooling rate and the co-
efficient of performance of the refrigerating machine [34, 36, 75]. Haywood et al. [42]
reported that there are conditions for Stirling refrigerating machines to provide higher
performance than vapor compression machines. The finding of the researchers can be
seen in Fig. 2.19. The maximum cooling capacity was obtained when the volume ratio
was almost equal to the temperature ratio for the developed Beta type prototype refrig-
erator [44]. The researchers also found that nitrogen had a better cooling capacity than
helium. Nie et al. [71] pointed out the refrigeration heat capacity and COP of large-scaled
Stirling refrigeration are independent with the surface area. The COP of V-type Stirling-
cycle refrigerator near-ambient cooling conditions has been reported to be comparable
with the vapor compression refrigerating systems and applicable for domestic refrigera-
tion [55, 70] and it is confirmed as seen in Fig. 2.19. The impact of three different fluids
(air, hydrogen, and helium) on the performance of a Stirling refrigerator was investigated
and the result showed that almost all the three working gases behave in a similar way but
hydrogen slightly outperforms most of the time [77].
A Beta-type Stirling cycle machine of 100 W refrigeration capacity for household refrig-
eration application was mathematically designed and experimentally tested [44]. The
researchers studied the effect of parameters such as dead volume ratio, the ratio of the
compression volume to the expansion volume, types of working fluids, and the piston
and displacer phase difference on the refrigerating performance. Ataer and Karabu-
lut [55] conducted a thermodynamic control volume analysis on a V-type Stirling-cycle
refrigerator subjected to periodic mass flow and evaluated the work done, instantaneous
pressure, and coefficient of performance of the Stirling refrigerator. The V-type integral
Stirling refrigerator (VISR) for domestic application was investigated based on simulation
and experimentations and the parameters such as the power intake and the coefficient of
performance were analyzed under different rotating frequencies and charged pressures
[70]. Furthermore,Tekin and Ataer [77] investigated the thermodynamic performance of
a V-type Stirling refrigerating machine in a view for higher cooling capacity and COP
as an alternative to vapor compression type refrigerator. In this research, the effect of
porosity of regenerator, the phase angle between the pistons, pressure and frequency on

COP and cooling capacity for the three working fluids had been investigated. Razani et
al. [75] developed a thermodynamic model for an exergy flow analysis for Stirling refriger-
ator. Sauer et al. [136] pointed out that one-dimensional differential models are important
tools for the design and optimization of regenerative machines since they require far less
computing time than multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics models and are still
capable of describing the various losses.

Stirling heat pump was investigated as a realistic alternative to vapor compression ma-
chine [42, 87, 100]. A non-linear mathematical model was developed for an air-filled Al-
pha Stirling refrigerator by incorporating air thermodynamics, heat transfer from the walls,
as well as heat transfer and fluid resistance in the regenerator and different variables
were determined for both working spaces [94]. Furthermore, the researchers tested the

machine experimentally by replacing the piston-cylinder assembly with a flexible cham-
ber and investigated the performance of the refrigerator. Ahmadi et al. [88] optimized
a Stirling heat pump using multi-objective criteria in finite time. The researchers simul-
taneously considered the three objective functions such as the maximization of heating
load and coefficient of performance, and the minimization of input power of the Stirling
heat pump. The researcher analyzed both external and internal irreversibilities. External
irreversibility is due to a finite temperature difference between the gas and the heat ex-
changers while the internal irreversibility is due to the regenerative heat loss and entropy
generation. In the year 2015, the author used the finite time thermodynamics approach
for thermo-economic multi optimization of Stirling heat pumps [100]. Hachem et al. [105]
evaluated the performances of a Beta type Stirling refrigerating machine having a regen-
erative displacer by considering complex phenomena which are related to compressible
fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and heat transfer for the energy analysis.




   Figure 2.21: Stirling refrigerator performances versus regenerator diameter [130].

To design an experimental Stirling cycle refrigeration unit, an adiabatic numerical model
was developed [120]. The research presented a simple time discretization model consid-
ering the cylinders as adiabatic spaces and the results were verified by another modeling
technic called the full three dimensional CFD. The result of the analysis showed the com-
pliance of the adiabatic model with the full 3D CFD model. Various Stirling refrigerators
were analyzed with and without a regenerator and the coefficient of performance of the
machine was evaluated [133]. Hachem et al. [130] developed a thermodynamic model
and conducted an experimental validation to optimize an air-filled Beta-type Stirling re-
frigeration machine with special attention to evaluate the effect of geometrical parameters
such as dead space volume and swept volume of the compression and expansion space.
The regenerator parameters on the performance of refrigerator were also analyzed and
optimized by the researchers(see Fig. 2.20 and 2.21). Chaudhari et al. [115] developed
a mathematical formulation using loss factor to free piston Stirling cooler for domestic re-
frigeration application. Multi-objective optimization has been performed using non-ideal
adiabatic analysis to optimize Gamma type Stirling refrigerator [141]. The researchers
indicated that the cooling capacity increased with the increase of operating frequency
based on analysis and experimental results where the COP has attained a maximum
value. Furthermore, they described that the optimum COP value for the air occurred at a

Guo et al.[150] introduced a general model to various types of Stirling refrigerators with
analytical solutions. A Beta-type Stirling cooler was developed with a rhombic drive sys-
tem [148]. In the same year, a similar Beta-type of Stirling refrigerator was designed and
fabricated to achieve a rapid transfer of heat from the system [152]. Helium and carbon
dioxide have been used as a working fluid and the more efficient fluid was determined.

achieve very high efficiencies and replace the domestic refrigerators while achieving cost
competitiveness [28]. Oguz et al. [39] conducted an experimental work and reported the
COP values for FPSCs operating with warm head temperatures close to 30 oC were typ-
ically found between 2 and 3 for cold head temperatures around 0 oC, falling to around 1
for temperatures approaching −40 oC. Hachem et al. [105] predicted that the drop-in heat
exchanger efficiency would influence the pressure ratio and so the refrigeration capacity
would be reduced substantially. In the year 2017, Hachem et al. [130] evaluated different
losses associated with Stirling refrigerator that directly affect cooling performance of the
refrigerator and they described these losses are functions of regenerator diameter and
length as seen in Fig. 2.23. The researchers pointed out that the optimal values of diam-
eter and length for the prototype Beta-type Stirling refrigerator are about 22 mm and 60
mm respectively. A short summary of research findings about Stirling cycle refrigerator
for moderate temperature application is shown in Table 2.2.



2.7/    CONCLUSION

Currently, the Vapor Compression Refrigeration (VCR) technologically exists at the satu-
rated level and is suited for household cooling applications. Although, VCR is an efficient
technology especially for moderate temperature refrigeration applications, because of
HFC refrigerants the environmental concern is increasing due to global warming. Stir-
ling refrigerators for moderate temperature application is one of the technologies that is
brought from the concern about the use of HFC refrigerants and their effect on global
warming potential. A detailed review of literature has been conducted about the research
and development made on the Stirling cycle refrigerators. This Stirling cycle refrigerators
are the counterpart of work producing Stirling cycle engines and generally have the same
configurations and driving mechanisms as their counterparts. The review covers config-
urations and drive mechanisms, thermodynamic modeling techniques as well as detailed
review on the development status of Stirling coolers for low temperature and moderate
temperature applications. The main conclusions are summarized:


   • Lots of researches have been done on low-temperature coolers with different drive
     mechanisms. As a result of this, Stirling coolers have reached comparable per-
     formance with other technologies and are widely applied at cryogenic temperature
     applications.

   • The number of researches are limited on Stirling cycle refrigerators for moderate
     temperature applications. This is mainly because of the current most commonly
     used vapor compression refrigerating technology is found at the optimal technolog-
     ical level and cost.

   • For Stirling cryocoolers, the pulse-tube drive mechanism with multi-stage has
     achieved the lowest temperature with a three-stage high-frequency pulse tube cry-
     ocooler (HPTC) a no-load temperature of 3.6 K reported.

   • Recently the demand for alternative refrigerating technology is increasing due to
     environmental concern resulted mostly from the existing technology HFC gas emis-
     sions.

     • Even though the choice of heat exchangers design and working volumes for Stirling
       machine depends on the application area, most researches that have done so far
       particularly on moderate temperature Stirling cycle refrigerator are directly experi-
       mented by reversing the existing Stirling engine. For instance, the heater and cooler
       of the engine are acting as chiller and hot heat exchanger respectively for refriger-
       ating machine. Furthermore, the regenerator parameters including the porosity and
       the relative size of working volumes have a greater effect on the performance of
       the machine. In the Stirling engine, all the components are designed and manufac-
       tured to produce the maximum power output or efficiency. Hence, such reversing a
       machine configuration may not produce the optimum cooling or COP.

     • Second-order numerical models can be utilized to simulate every type of Stirling
       engines/coolers with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, due to much lower
       computation time compared to third-order models, second-order models can be
       used easily for design and optimization purpose.

     • Results from the researches done so far on the Stirling cycle refrigerating machines
       for moderate temperature household application shows that Stirling cycle machines
       are promising alternatives to the current technology in use for the same application.

     • It has been recognized that one of the challenges of Stirling machines is the cost of
       production as it demands higher accuracy manufacturing to minimize gas leakage
       as well as to create smooth motion between parts, and the material has to be se-
       lected to withstand the high temperature and pressure. The operating temperature
       and pressure ranges of moderate temperature cooling machine are by far lower
       than that of its counterpart. Therefore, it could be possible to reduce the cost of
       cooling machine through designing and selecting a reasonable material.

     • The other development problems of all Stirling machines including coolers is its
       difficulty to avoid gas leakage and different thermal losses. In addition, for moder-
       ate temperature cooling application, developing Stirling refrigeration machines that
       could outperform the conventional VCR is still challenging. However, global warm-
       ing potential (GWP) concern has to be taken in to account for the comparison of
       different technologies.

     • The researches done so far on moderate temperature Stirling refrigerator did not
       show clearly the configurations that have better performance for a different range of
       cooling temperatures.

The global concern to create clean environment and the increased demand in refrigera-
tion; on the other hand, the high global warming potential of refrigerants used in conven-
tional VCR technology lead to the increased interest in alternative technologies. Stirling
cycle refrigerator for moderate cooling application is found to be a potential candidate.
However, the Stirling cycle machines as a general have several limitations, the efforts
done so far on the design of Stirling refrigerating machine is very limited and does not
consider fully the design and developmental requirements of the cooling machine for par-
ticular applications. Therefore, future researches on Stirling cycle moderate temperature
cooling machines have to be designed considering the operating condition as well as suit-
able configuration, all components must be produced, and tested based on the cooling
temperature requirement.

It is noted that Stirling refrigerator have been found as potential alternative technology
for domestic applications. The design of a Stirling machine requires the understanding
of the processes that govern their operation. The first attempt to describe this process
was through the ideal Stirling thermodynamic cycle. However, the ideal thermodynamic
cycle could not show the actual process in the Stirling cycle refrigerator. Hence, in this
chapter, a second-order numerical model has been adopted and suggested based on the
review findings presented in section 2.4 for the design of an air-filled Beta-type Stirling re-
frigerator. The developed model is a non-ideal second-order numerical model called the
modified simple considers the effects of various losses for domestic cooling [160]. The
study categorizes and investigates losses based on their effect. Then, the simulation of
the model has been performed using MATLAB code. Then, the model has been validated
with the reversed model (as engine and using GPU-3 machine) and direct experimenta-
tion using Femto 60 machine as a refrigerator.



3.1/     I DEAL ADIABATIC MODELING

The dead volumes occupied inside the hot heat exchanger, regenerator, and chiller re-
main constant during the refrigeration cycle. On the other hand, the volume in the com-
pression and expansion spaces changes continuously and thus determine the pressure
variation over the cycle. The volume variations in compression and expansion spaces are
controlled by the dynamics of the crank mechanism, which determines the position of the
pistons at different crank angles of the cycle.
In real Stirling cycle machines, the compression and expansion spaces are considered
as adiabatic, in which there is no heat transfer to the surroundings. The overall Stirling
cycle refrigeration machine is configured into five control volumes (two working spaces
and three perfectly effective heat exchangers) serially connected in the same way as
described by [20]. In this respect, the model is similar to the ideal isothermal model with
the gas temperature in the hot heat exchanger and the chiller is assumed as an isothermal
condition with respective temperature value. The control volumes for the analysis include
compression space(c), hot heat exchanger(h), regenerator(r), chiller(cr), and expansion
space(e) as shown in Fig. 3.1. The assumptions taken for such ideal adiabatic analysis
are as follows:


    • The compression and expansion spaces are adiabatic.

     • All processes are performed in a steady-state condition.

     • The temperature of the working fluid in the regenerator is linearly changed.

     • The kinetic and potential energies of gas streams are negligible.

     • Heat is transferred to the working fluid only in the hot heat exchanger and chiller

     • Heat transfer to the environment is negligible.

     • The machine is working at constant angular velocity.

Although the Stirling machine does not operate with ideal cycles, the ideal Stirling cy-
cle demonstrates the principles behind the Stirling machine. Hence, ideal cycle would
be the starting point of our analysis. In this section, the Stirling cycle refrigerating ma-
chine is numerically modelled by ideal adiabatic model in which, first, conservation laws
are applied across the overall machine and then various equations are applied for each
control spaces. The starting point of the analysis is the conservation of mass that is the
total mass of working gas in the Stirling refrigeration machine remains constant. In ideal
conditions, there is no mass leakage and therefore the total mass is the summation of
masses in the five control volumes and it is given as:

In the case of cooling machine, the displacer forces the working fluid between expansion
and compression space whereas the power piston converts the mechanical power into
pressure of the gas. The working fluid used in this analysis is air and it is an ideal gas,
which is valid for the regenerative Stirling cycle refrigerators as the process is far from the
critical point of the gas. Thus, the equation of state is valid for this investigation.

Enthalpy is transported across the interface of control volumes with mass flow rate and
upstream temperature, T . There are four interfaces between the five cells of Stirling cycle
machine through which enthalpy is transported by virtue of mass flow ṁ or Dm shown in
Fig. 3.1. The interfaces are:

    • Compression space/hot heat exchanger

    • Hot heat exchanger/regenerator

    • Regenerator/chiller

    • Chiller/expansion space

The temperature in working spaces varies based on the degree of expansion and com-
pression as shown in Fig. 3.1. Temperature of the gas in the compression space is either
greater or less than temperature of the hot heat exchanger. Similarly, temperature of the
air in expansion space may be greater or less than temperature of the chiller. So, the
direction of the flow of fluid depends on temperature gradient. By convention, we arbi-
trarily assume that the arrows (from compression space to expansion space) as shown in
Fig. 3.1 represent the positive direction of the flow of fluid and the reverse is negative.
The working gas temperatures across compression space and hot heat exchanger (T ch )
as well as across chiller and expansion space (T cre ) are conditional temperatures based
on the flow direction and are evaluated as:


                            I f ṁch > 0, T ch = T c , i f not T ch = T h                (3.5)

Generally, temperature of the gas at the interface takes the temperature of the upstream
control space. Fig. 3.1 shows that the hot heat exchanger and chiller temperatures are
assumed to be constant and the regenerator temperature is assumed to vary linearly from
chiller to hot heat exchanger temperature. The linear variation permits the evaluation of
mean effective temperature for the regenerator space and it is given as:

The energy balance equation based on the first law of thermodynamics for a control
volume in an open system is given by:

                       δQi δWi                                            δ(mi T i )
                           +    = C p (T i,o ṁi,o − T i,in ṁi,in ) + Cv                (3.8)

Using the above operator D, equation(Eq. 3.8) becomes:


                      DQi + DWi = C p (T i,o ṁi,o − T i,in ṁi,in ) + Cv D(mi T i )   (3.10)

Where,
                                            DWi = −PDVi                                (3.11)

For the three heat exchangers including regenerator (DWi = 0 and Cv D(mi T i ) = Cv T i Dmi ),
owing to constant volume and constant temperature. The energy balance equa-
tion(Eq. 3.10) for heat exchangers will be reduced to:


                           DQi = C p (T i,o ṁi,o − T i,in ṁi,in ) + Cv T i Dmi       (3.12)

The change in mass in three heat exchangers (hot heat exhanger, regenerator, and
chiller) due to pressure change could be found from (Eq. 3.4) as:

3.2/     M ODIFIED IDEAL ADIABATIC ANALYSIS

The performance of Stirling machine is strongly dependent on geometrical and operating
parameters such as physical dimensions, heat transfer coefficients, heat source temper-
atures and regenerator characteristics. Predicting the performance of Stirling machine is
important for the design of the machine. In the past decade of years, many researchers
and scientists have studied the Stirling machine numerically or experimentally.
The system of the above ideal adiabatic differential equations was modified by including
the effects of gas leakage from working space to buffer space (crankcase) and shuttle
heat losses by displacer from compression to expansion spaces. This is by adapting
and modifying the engine models (simple model by [20] and Simple-II model by [89]) to
the refrigeration machine through reversing the process. The main reasons for the in-
clusion of mass leakage and shuttle heat losses to the differential equation are because
these losses can affect the overall working of the machine by changing the pressure and
temperature of the working fluid. So, the conservation equations of mass (Eq. 3.1) and
energy (Eq. 3.10) of the original ideal adiabatic equations of the Stirling cycle refrigera-
tion machine presented before have been modified by including the mass leakage loss
and shuttle heat losses respectively. Due to analytical complexity, other losses are not
included directly in the modified ideal adiabatic simulation and are treated separately.
The energy losses in a Stirling cycle machine are due to the thermodynamic and mechan-
ical processes of the cycle. To accurately predict a Stirling cycle refrigeration machine
performance and to design an optimal machine for a specific application, a detailed in-
vestigation of various losses has to be considered in the modified simple analysis part as
discussed in section 3.3. Different types of heat and power losses are shown in Fig. 3.2.

3.2.1/    M ASS   LEAKAGE LOSS

The design of seals in the Stirling machines is somewhat complicated by the fact that
the running of the machine in the working space should be dry, that is without oil. Fur-
thermore, the bearing pressure of the seals should be limited to avoid local heating and
decrease mechanical friction losses. Therefore, clearance seals are usually used to avoid
excessive wear and hence to extend the service life of the Stirling machine. The clear-
ance seals cause gas leakage between the compression space and the expansion space
through the displacer’s clearance and between the compression space and the bounce
space through the power piston’s clearance [108]. Stirling cycle machine seal design
therefore involves some compromise, which may result to gas leakage to some degree.
The leakage loss is more critical especially at higher frequency and higher pressure Stir-
ling machines [147]. This is because at higher pressure and higher frequency the rate
of mass leakage is higher. Hence, studying the thermodynamic effect of mass leakage
is one aspect of this design. Then, the original mass balance (Eq. 3.1) of ideal adia-
batic model is modified by incorporating mass leakage from the compression space to
the bounce space through the clearance gap between power piston and cylinder as:


                              mc + mh + mr + mcr + me − mleak = mt                           (3.30)
 where mleak is the amount of the working fluid being lost from the compression space
into the crankcase.
The amount of working gas lost per unit time from working space to the crank case is
determined as [20]:

                                        P + Pbu f f er         J 3 P − Pbu f f er
                       Dmleak = d p π                  (U p J − (                 ))         (3.31)

where d p , J, T g , L p , u p , µ, P and Pbu f f er are piston diameter, annular gap between piston
and cylinder, gas temperature, piston length, piston linear velocity, viscosity of working
fluid, pressure of working space and pressure of buffer space respectively.
Differentiating (Eq. 3.30), gives:


                         Dmc + Dmh + Dmr + Dmcr + Dme − Dmleak = 0                           (3.32)


3.2.2/    SHUTTLE HEAT LOSSES

The main function of displacer is to displace the working fluid between compression and
expansion volume. However, it also acts as a separator to maintain temperature differ-
ence between the two working spaces. During its reciprocating movement, the displacer
is frequently contacting with two temperature layers (compression and expansion space)
of the working fluid. This effect leads the displacer motion to shuttle heat from hot end
to cold end. Shuttle heat losses resulted when the displacer oscillates across a tempera-
ture gradient. In a Stirling cycle refrigerating machine, the displacer absorbs heat at the
hot end (compression side) of its stroke and gives off this heat at the cold end (expansion
side) of the stroke. This loss is mainly depends on the nature of motion and the difference
in temperature between the two sides.

The shuttle heat losses (DQ shut ) as given in [128, 147, 65] is calculated by using equation:

                                                   πs2 kg dd

compression and expansion spaces, respectively.
As other differential equations, the change in mass in the compression and expansion
space could be found from Eqs. 3.23 and 3.24 by including the shuttle heat and gas
leakage effects as:

Substituting Eqs. 3.35 and 3.36 in Eq. 3.22 and rearranging, the change in pressure is
modified as:

Furthermore, particularly for the Beta-type configuration machine, shuttle heat and mass
leakage effects could also affect the mass flow rate across the heat exchanger and work-

heat exchanger interface is given as:

And the mass flow rate across the expansion space and chiller interface is:

The other equations are the same as those of the ideal adiabatic model. So, the summary
of the modified ideal adiabatic model is shown in Table 3.2.
After evaluating the modified ideal adiabatic model (to find ideal input power requirement
and ideal cooling power), heat transfer losses, and power losses based on Fig. 3.3, the
actual performance of a refrigerator is determined. The heat and power losses other

decreases as a result of heat power losses. Then, the actual cooling power produced

3.3/     M ODIFIED SIMPLE ANALYSIS

The system of analysis of losses for the Stirling cycle refrigerator is adapted from the
engine model [20, 89]. Based on their effect on the working condition of the machine, the
losses considered in the modified simple analysis were classified into two. The effects
of first category of losses including regenerator imperfection and fluid friction losses in
the heat exchangers are are used to correct the temperature and pressure of working
fluid found from differential simulation in section 3.2. Then, losses such as power loss
due to mechanical friction, conduction heat loss in the regenerator wall, power loss due
to finite speed of piston, gas spring hysteresis loss, and pumping loss are evaluated as
independent losses. Hence, the effects of these losses are considered only to correct the
refrigerating performance (input power demand, cooling power, and COP).
All thermal and power losses associated with the machine are assumed to be indepen-
dent one from another and the total losses are the summation of the losses with the
respective category.

3.3.1/   L OSS   DUE TO INTERNAL HEAT CONDUCTION IN THE REGENERATOR

In the Stirling cycle machines, regenerators are physically located between the hot heat
exchanger and cold heat exchanger/chiller. The two heat exchangers operate at different
temperatures in which the difference of the temperature depends on the application of the
machine. Even though the temperature difference for domestic Stirling cycle refrigerators
is not as large as that of Stirling engines or cryocoolers, the internal conduction heat loss
is not negligible due to heat flow from hot heat exchanger to chiller through regenerator
wall. This heat loss by internal conduction through the walls of the regenerator has been
expressed as [93, 137, 76, 64]:

3.3.2/   R EGENERATOR       IMPERFECTION         (N ON - IDEAL       HEAT TRANFER ) LOSS

The regenerator is designed to absorb part of the heat contained in the working fluid dur-
ing constant volume heat rejection process as hotter gas passes through the regenerator
and to release ideally the same amount of heat when colder gas passes back in the re-
verse process. Nevertheless, because of thermal imperfections of the regenerator, it is
impossible to recover all of the heat absorbed. Hence, the performance of the regener-
ator is usually evaluated by its effectiveness, which simply expresses the fraction of the
heat absorbed from the regenerator that could be recovered for a given regenerator de-
sign and operating conditions. For a Stirling cycle refrigerating system having a non-ideal
regenerator, when the working gas flows from the chiller to the hot heat exchanger, the
gas will have the temperature somewhat lower than the hot heat exchanger and then heat
will be transferred from regenerator to the working gas.
Due to the imperfection of the regenerator, the thermal energy loss is given by:

3.3.3/    L OSSES   DUE TO PRESSURE DROP IN HEAT EXCHANGERS

The flowing of internal gas through the hot heat exchanger, regenerator and chiller of
the Stirling cycle refrigerator is in direct contact with the walls of these heat exchangers.
The flow of working fluid is forced convection heat transfer with large surface contact to
enhance heat transfer. These resulted in fluid friction. The friction losses in the heat
exchangers results in pressure drops and it leads to a reduction of performance of the
machine. The pressure losses in heat exchangers are calculated to evaluate the amount
of power losses due to the drops in pressure. The amount of energy dissipated (W f r )
in regenerative Stirling cycle refrigerating machine due to pressure drops at the hot heat
exchanger, regenerator and chiller is evaluated as:

The Reynolds friction factor for the regenerator (woven screen) has been evaluated from
the correlations given by Gedeon and Wood [35] as:

                                    fr = 129 + 2.91Re0.897                            (3.57)

Then, the Reynolds friction factor for chiller and hot heat exchangers is defined based
on [20, 143] as:


                                         fr = 0.0791Re0.75                            (3.58)

The frictional factor used in this analysis has been obtained from empirical correlations,
based on the the heat transfer coefficient correlation valid for stationary flows.


3.3.4/    M ECHANICAL     FRICTION LOSSES

Because of the relative motion between parts of the refrigeration machine, losses due to
mechanical friction increases the amount of power input required for the process. The
relative motions in such refrigerating machines include the joints in the displacer and the
crank, between the piston and the crank, and between the crank and the axle of the
prime mover. In addition, there is mechanical friction between the piston/displacer and
the cylinder wall due to the fact that the piston/displacer does not move perfectly in its
axial direction.
Therefore, the power losses due to mechanical friction in one cycle is calculated by the
following equation:


                                   Wmec. f r = 2∆Pmec. f r V swc                      (3.59)

3.3.5/    H EAT   CONDUCTION LOSSES

Due to a considerable temperature difference between compression and expansion
spaces in Stirling cycle machines, which are separated by displacer, the heat conduc-
tion cannot be neglected. The heat conduction losses across the displacer, regenerator
and cylinder walls are an additional load for heat exchangers. This loss is independent
of the machine frequency and pressure. The losses due to the heat of conduction across
the displacer during the refrigerating cycle is written based on Fourier law as described
by [137]:

wall, A is the corresponding cross-sectional area, ∆T is the difference in temperature

3.3.6/    L OSSES   DUE TO FINITE SPEED OF PISTON

In a regenerative Stirling cycle refrigerating machine, the working spaces are periodically
compressed and expanded by the pistons or piston and piston/displacer. Based on the
finite speed thermodynamic principle, the instantaneous pressure of compression and
expansion spaces differs from the pressure in the respective piston surfaces. The work
losses due to finite speed of the piston in one cycle is evaluated by the product of pressure
drop and the piston swept volume [38, 106, 132].

3.3.7/    G AS   SPRING HYSTERESIS LOSSES

As the internal gas of the Stirling machine compressed and expanded periodically by the
piston, it is likely that this internal gas could begin to act as a spring. This thermodynamic
process is not recoverable and may introduce additional losses in the Stirling machine
that could be in the form of the dissipation of the internal energy of the working fluid. The
working gas acts actually as a gas spring which stores energy when it is compressed
and releases energy when it is expanded. This type of dissipation loss due to non-ideal
character of working gas is modelled using the following expression [20, 82]:

3.3.8/    P UMPING   LOSSES

Because of the periodic variation of pressure throughout the working space of a Stir-
ling cycle machine, the gap between the displacer and the cylinder wall can absorb and
transfer gas from or to the expansion volume. The pumping losses are due to the fixed
clearance volume existing between the displacer and the cylinder wall so that the dis-
placer can move without rubbing. This leads to cooling loss in the refrigerating machine,
named as pumping loss. Based on [41, 132] the pumping loss is given as;

3.4/     S OLUTION METHOD

The mathematical model described in section 3.2 and 3.3 shows a set of algebraic dif-
ferential equations. An algorithm was developed to describe the method for implement-
ing the solutions of the set of formulated differential equations. The method of solving
of these numerical differential equations begin with taking the geometrical parameters
and initial operating conditions of the machine as input parameters. The solution algo-
rithm of the present numerical model is illustrated by the flow chart in Fig. 3.3. Schmidt
analysis is used for the initial estimation of the mass of working gas and modified ideal
adiabatic analysis to determine the working pressure and temperature. As shown, the
first part of the analysis is to numerically solve the set of ordinary differential equations.
The step is quite similar to the original ideal adiabatic analysis developed by Urieli and
Berchowitz [20], except the differential equations have been adapted to reverse cycle and
corrected to include losses (shuttle heat and mass leakage) that have a direct impact on
working fluid pressure and temperature of the Stirling refrigerating machine. 24 variables
and 16 ordinary differential equations are solved for a full cycle after the geometries of the
machine are specified. Because of the cyclic nature of the system, the adiabatic model
could be formulated as an initial value problem by assigning consistent arbitrary initial
conditions and classical fourth-order Runge Kutta method is applied to solve the system
of the differential equations of the numerical model with MATLAB.
In the model, void/dead volume parameters of the hot heat exchanger, regenerator and
chiller (Vh , Vr , and Vcr ) are determined based on the geometrical specifications of these
heat exchangers. The active volume variables including Vc , Ve , dVc , and dVe are obtained

based on the configuration of the refrigerating machine as analytic functions of the crank
angle θ (or time of operation of the engine) in one cycle of operation, which is expected
to span from = 0o to = 360o . Among the twenty four variables, eleven variables and
derivatives including Q shut , mleak , Vc , Ve , p, mc , mh , mr , mcr , me , and W are analytically deter-
mined and seven derivatives (DT c , DT e , DQh , DQr , DQcr , DWc and DWe ) are numeri-
cally integrated using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The other six mass flow rate
equations and boundary conditions are initial value problems. Initial gas temperatures in
compression and expansion spaces have been estimated and are equal to the hot heat
exchanger and chiller temperatures, respectively. Then, the numerical solution of differ-
ential equations is executed repeatedly until the steady-state condition obtained. The
solution for the algebraic differential equations considered that cyclic steady state condi-
tions are reached at boundary conditions. At the end of the steady-state cycle (θ = 2π) the
magnitude of temperature converges to the respective temperature at the beginning of the
cycle (θ = 0). The iterative process assumed that the initial values are known, and then
the system is solved until cyclic steady state conditions, which was numerically reached
when the difference between the assumed initial values and the values calculated at the
end of the cycle are lower than a defined error.

algorithm enters the second part of the analysis called modified simple analysis. The
purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the overall performance of the machine by incor-
porating all expected losses. In the modified simple analysis, the effect of regenerator
imperfection is considered to correct the hot heat exchanger and the chiller temperatures
based on Eqs. (3.52 and 3.53). The feedback is given to the modified ideal adiabatic
solution section by correcting the heat exchangers temperature until the temperatures
converges. Finally, the amount of the cooling production and the magnitude of input
power requirement are corrected including the effect of all considered respective losses
as well as COP is evaluated.



3.5/     M ODEL VALIDATION

In the previous sections, a numerical model is introduced to predict the performance of a
regenerative Stirling cycle refrigerator. In this section, the model validation is presented.
The developed numerical model (modified simple model) is validated by two ways. The
first, validation method is by reversing the refrigeration model to the engine model and
simulate the model to validate with other previous works. This is because there are no
enough researches in the Stirling refrigeration area for validation. The second way of
model validation is through direct experimental investigation using FEMTO 60 engine
prototype.


3.5.1/   M ODEL VALIDATION       USING ENGINE MODEL

The modified simple numerical model for the Stirling refrigerator is validated by revers-
ing the model to the engine model. Primarily the developed modified simple model for
refrigerators is reversed to the engine model. However, it is worth mentioning here that
it was difficult to find previously published numerical model results of Stirling engine of
the same type and configuration (FEMTO 60) as the one considered in the present work
for the purpose of validation. Hence, the parameters of 3 kW GPU-3 Stirling engine are
used for validation as there are enough published papers using such type of engine. To
verify the reliability of this model (modified simple), the simulation results are compared
with other theoretical models’ simulation results and with the experimental results. The
experimental results which were tested in the NASA Lewis Research Center using 3kW
GPU-3 Stirling engine were presented [12, 17]. The machine specification (GPU-3) for
the validation of the model with the engine model is presented in Table 3.3.
The reversed modified simple model was simulated and engine performances (power
output and efficiency) have been compared with the results of other models and ex-
perimental results as shown in Table 3.4. The comparison considers the valida-
tion of simulation result of existing modified simple model (reversed) with the results
of the different models from original adiabatic models [20, 64] to the recent mod-
els [89, 101, 106, 107, 112, 147, 159] and with experimental results [12, 17]. The analysis
result using the modified simple model (this study) showed a very high accuracy level with
a relative error of +4% for brake power output and by +0.9% for efficiency as compared
with experimental result for (GPU-3) engine. The overall result from the table shows that
the present model matches better as compared with all other theoretical models.

result from Fig.3.4a and b demonstrate the effect of operating frequency for the experi-
ment and theoretical models including the present modified simple model at 27.6 bar and
41.4 bar, respectively. At a mean pressure of 27.6 bar, it could be seen in Fig.3.4a, that
the predicted brake power by the current model is very close to the experimental result
within all operating ranges. From Fig. 3.4a, it could be seen that the accuracy of the
current model (modified simple) in predicting the brake power is by far better than other
models considered as it is closer to experimental results at each frequency. The optimum
brake power for both present theoretical model and experimental work are found near to
an operating frequency of 41.67 Hz. Similarly, Fig. 3.4b demonstrates the comparison of
brake power prediction between previous researches (simple [20], simple II [89], PSLV
[102]), present model, and experimental work at a mean pressure of 41.4 bar.
Generally, from both Fig. 3.4a and b, it could be verified that the present modified simple
model predicts the brake power more accurately. The present model and experimental
results confirmed that brake power has optimum value with respect to the operating fre-
quency. The decrease in brake power with operating frequency after the optimum value
could be due to an increase of losses in the engine (mechanical friction, losses due to
the finite speed of piston, and the increase in fluid friction in heat exchangers).
The evaluation of power prediction error for different models including simple [20], simple
II [89], PSLV [102], and the present modified simple model against the experimental
result [17] is illustrated in Fig. 3.4c and d at charging pressures of 27.6 bar and 41.4 bar
respectively. As shown in the figure, the deviations of errors decrease from the original
simple model, simple II, PSLV, and the present modified simple model. The graphs gen-
erally show the more recent models have a lower deviation from experimental result. The
more recent models PSVL and present modified simple models have more reasonable
errors. The modified simple model (this study) has the most reasonable accuracy and
even the errors at different frequencies seem uniform for this model except at very high
operating frequency. The power prediction errors for this model are by far lower than all
considered models (simple [20], simple II [89], PSLV [102]) at each frequency. As seen

in Fig. 3.4c, at a mean pressure of 27.6 bar, the prediction error of power is relatively
very constant in the case of a modified simple model (this study) and the maximum error
is 5.77% except at very high operating frequency (58.33 Hz). On the other hand, as the
mean pressure increases to 41.4 bar as shown in Fig. 3.4d, the power prediction error
for PSLV [102] model also shows a very closer trend with the modified simple model (this
study) and both show the relative constant error except at very high operating frequency.
Fig. 3.5a and b presented the comparison of the brake efficiency for the present model
with other theoretical models (simple [20], simple II [89], PSLV [102]) and with experi-
mental results (reported in [17]) for the GPU-3 Stirling engine against operating frequency
and at charging pressures of 27.6 bar and 41.4 bar respectively. Based on Fig. 3.5a at
a mean pressure of 27.6 bar, even though, all models have different deviations from the
experimental result, the predicted brake efficiency by this model (modified simple) is very
close with the experimental result at all operating frequency ranges. As could be seen
from Fig. 3.5a the accuracy of the current model (modified simple) in predicting the effi-
ciency is by far better than other models considered. Similarly, Fig. 3.5b shows the com-

parison of efficiency prediction between previous researches simple [20], simple II [89],
PSLV [102], present model (modified simple), and experimental work at a mean pressure
of 41.4 bar. The same trend is observed that the accuracy of efficiency prediction is better
in case of the current model.

From Fig. 3.5a and b, the efficiency for all models and experiments showed a decreasing
trend with increasing operating frequency at both mean pressures (27.66 and 41.4 bar).
The decrease in brake power with operating frequency could be due to an increase of
losses in the engine (mechanical friction, losses due to the finite speed of piston, the
pressure drop in heat exchangers).
The comparison of efficiency prediction error for different models including simple [20],
simple II [89], PSLV [102], and the present modified simple model at a heater and
cooler temperatures of 922 K and 286 K is demonstrated in Fig. 3.5c and d at charging
pressures of 27.6 bar and 41.4 bar respectively. As shown in the figure, the deviation
of errors decrease from the original simple [20], simple II [89], PSLV [102], and the
present modified simple model, respectively. The graph generally shows the more recent
models have a lower deviation from experimental results. The more recent models PSVL
and this study (modified simple model) have more reasonable errors. The efficiency
prediction errors for the current modified simple model are by far lower than all other


3.5. MODEL VALIDATION                                                                       63


considered models (simple [20], simple II [89], PSLV [102]) at each frequency and the
errors at different frequencies seem uniform for this model except at very high operating
frequency. As clearly seen in Fig. 3.5c, at a mean pressure of 27.6 bar, the prediction
error of efficiency is relatively very constant in the case of the modified simple model
(this study) and the maximum error is 7.25% except at very high operating frequency
(58.33 Hz). On the other hand, as the mean pressure increases to 41.4 bar as shown in
Fig. 3.5d, the power prediction error increases with operating frequency in the case of the
modified simple model.
Finally, from Table 3.4, Fig 3.4 and Fig. 3.5, it could be seen that the results of the present
model (modified simple model) are more closer to the results of experiment as compared
with the results of other models developed so far. Hence, it could be concluded that the
present model predicts power and effciency of Stirling engine more accurately. The main
reason for such better model results is the inclussion of appropriate losses directly in the
differential equation and as independent losses based on their effect. The same trends
are observed for the results of the present model as compared with experimental values
for both power Fig 3.4 and efficiency Fig. 3.5 pridiction. Hence, the numerical model
developed for refrigeration could be used to design a cooling machine at a reasonable
accuracy.



3.5.2/    M ODEL   VALIDATION WITH EXPERIMENT


To validate the numerical model presented above, there are no enough published results
of numerical models and experimental works for Stirling cycle refrigeration machine of
the same type and configuration (FEMTO 60) as the one considered in the present work.
The numerical model presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3, was evaluated by considering
the FEMTO-60 Stirling engine operating as a refrigerating machine as a case study. The
photo of the cooling machine at cooling stage is shown in Fig. 3.6.
The considered experimental machine is a reversible thermal machine (motor and/or re-
ceiver) with Beta configuration and operates between two constant temperatures. This
machine consists of expansion space, heater (acts as a chiller in case of the cooling ma-
chine), regenerator, cooler (acts as a hot heat exchanger in case of the cooling machine),
compression space, piston, buffer space, and driving mechanisms. The power piston and
displacer are arranged within a single cylinder. The displacer piston controls the varia-
tions of the expansion volume (cold room) and the power piston controls the compression
space (hot room) for such Stirling refrigerating machine. The setup includes a regenera-
tive Stirling refrigerator, cooling water system, the electric supplier, and a data acquisition
system. The refrigerator is arranged with six thermometers and one pressure sensor for
measuring the working conditions.
The setup, the arrangement, and testing procedures of the experimental device was the
same as described by Djetel-Gothe et al. [153] and is shown in Fig. 3.7. The characteris-
tics of the Stirling refrigerator such as cold temperature, cooling capacity, and coefficient
of performance were investigated experimentally. The thermal load was applied by two
resistance heaters to the cold head of the Stirling cycle refrigerator, and steady-state
characteristics of the refrigerator were measured. For a varied input voltage, different
tests were carried out to determine the variation of the cooling performance with the cold
head temperature of the coolers varied from −40o C to 0o C.

The considered working gas for the experimental validation was nitrogen, which is as-
sumed to behave like a perfect gas. The hot heat exchanger and the chiller both have slot
geometric arrangement and the configuration of the regenerator is an annular configura-
tion with a stainless steel woven screens matrix. The main parameters and dimensions
of the experimental device are tabulated in Table 3.5.

The thermal model was validated with an experiment conducted at 7.3 Hz and 9.7 Hz for
a series of cooling temperatures and a charging pressure of 17.5 bar using FEMTO-60
engine model.
The comparison of cooling load of developed numerical model (modified simple) with
experimental results and the associated percentage of relative error is demonstrated in
Fig. 3.8. Fig. 3.8a, illustrates the comparison of the cooling load of the numerical model
(modified simple model) with experimental values for operating frequencies of 7.3 Hz and
9.7 Hz. Fig. 3.8, shows the relative error evaluated in predicting the cooling load of the
cooling machine for operating frequencies of 7.3 Hz and 9.7 Hz. The maximum relative
prediction error of -7.71 % was found for an operating frequency of 9.7 Hz.
Fig. 3.9 depicted the comparison of COP and the associated percentage of relative error
of developed non-ideal second-order thermal model (modified simple) with experimental
values. Fig. 3.9a, demonstrates the comparison of the COP of the numerical model
(modified simple model) with experimental values for operating frequencies of 7.3 Hz and
9.7 Hz. From the figure, we could see that the COP for simulation result shows more
closer values to the experimental results at all temperature ranges in the case of 7.3 Hz
than at 9.7 Hz. Fig. 3.9b, illustrates the relative error evaluated in predicting the COP
of the prototype Stirling machine for an operating frequencies of 7.3 Hz and 9.7 Hz. It
has seen that the maximum relative prediction error of 23.9 % was found for operating
frequency of 9.7 Hz (as shown in Fig. 3.9b).
Generally, from Fig. 3.9 and Fig. 3.8, it could be confirmed that the present modified
simple model predicts the cooling power and COP of the Stirling refrigerating machine for
moderate cooling application with reasonable accuracy.

3.6/     R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The discussion concerns simulation of a numerical model for the Stirling cycle refrigerator
with Beta configuration (FEMTO 60 Stirling engine working in reversed mode) conducted
at(T cr = 270 K, T h = 300 K, P = 17.5 bar and f = 7.5 Hz) . As described in section 3.5.2,
the working fluid used for experimental validation purpose was nitrogen. However, the
overall analysis and the optimization work have been conducted using air as a working
fluid except in comparison to the effects of the working fluids on cooling performance. In
this analysis, simulation results, particularly the mass flow rate of the working fluid, the

temperature of working fluid at a different section of the machine the pressure trend in
working volumes as well as the pressure drop in heat exchangers have been presented.
The solution of the numerical model is solved using MaATLAB code and the results are
presented after the steady-state condition is reached.
Fig. 3.10 demonstrates a plot of mass versus crank angle in five control volumes of the
refrigerating machine. As it is shown in Fig. 3.10, when the mass in compression space
is minimum, the mass in expansion space is maximum and vice versa. This is basically
related to the degree of compression and expansion. The amount of working fluid in the
regenerator and heat exchangers also varies with the crank angle. The mass of working
fluid in the regenerator is greater than the mass in the chiller and hot heat exchanger
at each rotational stages. The mass in the hot heat exchanger is the smallest of all.
Generally, as the void volume of heat exchangers increases, the amount of working fluid
also increases. Furthermore, the mass variation in the regenerator is higher than other
heat exchangers, and hence the volume of regenerator affects the performance of cooling
machine more than others.
Fig. 3.11 is a plot of temperature distribution in different control volumes (working spaces,
regenerator, and heat exchangers) with crank angle at hot heat exchanger temperature
of T h = 300 K, chiller temperature of T cr = 270 K, and an operating frequency of 7.5 Hz.
From Fig. 3.11, it is understood that the mean chiller gas temperature is 11 K less than
the chiller wall temperature and, the mean gas temperature in hot heat exchangers is 15
K greater than the hot heat exchanger wall temperature. The average gas temperature in

the expansion chamber at this particular situation is 259 K.
Fig. 3.12 shows the plot of the P-V diagram for the three analysis methods (Schmidt,
modified ideal adiabatic and modified simple analysis). The area limited by the P-V curve
represents the amount of net input power required to run the refrigerating machine. The
area for the modified simple analysis diagram is greater than the other two areas. This
area is the actual input power required and is greater than the ideal input power require-
ment as there are irreversibilities. Furthermore, Fig. 3.12 shows that the Schmidt analysis
is the most ideal as the area is very small.
Fig. 3.13 demonstrates the actual P-V diagrams of compression, expansion and total
spaces from the modified simple analysis. It is clear that the compression space is greater
than the expansion space area which shows the net input power requirement. Further-
more, the figure demonstrates that the maximum pressure in expansion spaces is lower
than the maximum pressure in compression space.
Fig. 3.14 is a diagram of energy transferred versus crank angle from modified simple anal-
ysis that shows the net input work done required, heat transfer across two heat exchang-
ers, and heat transfer in the regenerator at a charging pressure of 17.5 bar, frequency of
7.5 Hz, hot heat exchanger temperature T h = 300 K, and chiller temperature T cr = 270
K. As it could be seen, the net input work done increases during the compression phase
and decrease during the expansion phase. The input power requirement was found as
22.56 J and the cooling power was 53 J from this particular simulation of modified simple
model.

Fig. 3.15 demonstrates the actual working space (compression and expansion space)
pressure variation versus crank angle at a hot heat exchanger temperature of T h = 300
K, chiller temperature of T cr = 270 K, charging pressure of 17.5 bar, and frequency of 7.5

the compression space. This pressure difference between two working spaces results
from the pressure drop due to friction of fluid flow in three heat exchangers.
Fig. 3.16 shows the pressure drop due to fluid friction across the hot heat exchanger, the
regenerator, the chiller, and the total pressure drop in all these heat exchangers versus
the crank angle. As could be seen from the figure the pressure drop variation in the
regenerator was much higher than the pressure drop in the other two heat exchangers.
The maximum pressure drops for the regenerator and the total pressure drops were found
respectively as 1.23 bar and 1.30 bar (at a charging pressure of 17.5 bar, frequency of
7.5 Hz, hot heat exchanger temperature T h = 300 K and chiller temperature T cr = 270 K).
This result confirms that the major pressure drop existes in the regenerator and is almost
equal to the total pressure drop.
An elaborated view of pressure drop due to fluid friction in two heat exchangers (hot heat
exchanger and chiller) versus crank angle (degrees) is presented in Figure 3.17. The
pressure drop in the hot heat exchanger is much higher than that of the pressure drop in
the chiller and there is a phase lag too. One of the reasons may be in hot heat exchanger

3.7/    CONCLUSION


The main contribution presented in this chapter is the development of a non-ideal second
order numerical model called the modified simple model considering the effects of various
losses for the moderate temperature Stirling refrigerator. The purpose of this model was
to design a Beta type Stirling cycle domestic refrigerator with a crank driven mechanism
and using air as a working fluid. The numerical modeling of the refrigerating machine is
constructed in three consecutive sections. In the first section, the ideal adiabatic model
of Stirling engine is adapted for refrigeration machine. In the second section, the model-
ing is done through modifiying ideal adiabatic model to include the shuttle heat losses by
displacer movement and mass leakage to the crank case directly in the differential equa-
tion. Lastly, the modified simple modeling is constructed by incorporating other losses
(imperfect regeneration loss, internal heat conduction loss in the regenerator, losses due
to pressure drop in heat exchangers, heat conduction losses, gas spring hysteresis loss,
loss due to piston finite speed, and pumping loss) as independent losses.
These numerical differential equations have been solved by taking the geometrical pa-
rameters and initial operating conditions of the machine as input parameters. Classical
fourth-order Runge Kutta method is applied to solve the system of the differential equa-
tions. Then, MATLAB code is developed to solve the system of these differential equa-
tions over the consecutive cycles.

The numerical model was first validated with engine models by reversing the numerical
model. The developed modified simple model for refrigerators is reversed to the engine
model, then the parameters of 3 kW GPU-3 Stirling engine are used for validation. To ver-
ify the reliability of this model (modified simple), the simulation results are compared with
other theoretical models’ simulation results and with the experimental results. Second,
the numerical model is revalidated against experimental work conducted using FEMTOST
engine model as a cooling machine. The cold production from the numerical analysis and
experimental work are found as 439 W and 450 W, respectively at a chiller temperature
of 4oC with a relative error of -2.4%. The COP from numerical analysis and experimental
work are found as 0.92 and 0.9 respectively with a relative error of +2.2%. These re-
sults confirm that the developed numerical model for domestic Stirling refrigerator have
reasonable accuracy to predict the performance of the machine.

The developed numrical model in chapter 3, can predict the performance of domestic
Stirling refrigerator with very good accuracy. However, a higher performance Stirling
refrigerator could be designed using the developed model if parametric optimization is
conducted further. This chapter aims to analyze the effects that the different operational
variables, design (geometric) variables, different working fluids, shuttle heat losses, and
mass leakage losses to the buffer space might have on the cooling performance of the
Stirling refrigerator. The other objective of this chapter is to analyze the effects of oper-
ating and design variables on different types of losses and to propose better operating
and design variables. For this purpose, the developed numerical model was used for
the simulation of the FEMTO 60 engine model working in reverse cycle under different
operational and design conditions. Finally, through combining different optimized design
parameters, new combinations of parameters have been proposed which could produce
enhanced cooling performances of the Stirling refrigerator.



4.1/     E FFECT OF S HUTTLE AND MASS LEAKAGE LOSSES

The developed numerical model as shown in Chapter 3, incorporates the shuttle heat
transfer (heat loss from compression space to expansion space) and gas leakage from
the working space to the buffer space (crankcase) into the ideal adiabatic analysis. These
losses have a direct impact on the temperature and the working pressure of the fluid in
the working spaces. To evaluate the effect of mass leakage and shuttle heat losses on the
temperature, pressure, and overall performance of the refrigerating machine, the model
was run consequently without mass leakage and shuttle heat losses, only with mass
leakage, only with shuttle heat losses, and with mass leakage and shuttle heat losses
included in the differential equation.
The effect of shuttle heat losses on the temperature of the working fluid is illustrated in
Fig. 4.1. From Fig. 4.1, it could be seen that shuttle heat losses have a major effect on
the temperature of the gas. The shuttle heat losses have the effect of decreasing hot
gas temperature and increasing cold side gas temperature. At a charging pressure of
17.5 bar, hot heat exchanger temperature of 300 K, chiller temperature of 270 K, and
an operating frequency of 7.5 Hz, the average hot gas temperature decreases by 13 K,
and the average cold gas temperature increases by 9.2 K when incorporating the shuttle

effect in the differential equation. The shuttle heat losses have effect of decreasing hot
gas temperature and increasing cold gas temperature. This is because part of heat is
transported from hot space to cold space. On the other hand, since the mass of working
gas decreases in the compression space, the gas temperature in the compression space
increases when mass leakage is incorporated in the differential equation. The summary
of effect of incorporating shuttle heat losses and mass leakage losses are presented in
Table 4.1.

Furthermore, the effects of shuttle heat losses on the overall performance of the refrig-
erating machine have been evaluated. The cooling power and COP of the refrigerating
machine are found respectively as 450.6 W and 0.8 when shuttle losses are evaluated
separately and subtracted from cooling power. On the other hand, the cooling power
and COP are found as 347 W and 0.65 when shuttle heat losses are incorporated in the
differential equation. Furthermore, when we incorporate the mass leakage loss in the
differential equation the cooling power and COP have been reduced to 343 W and 0.64.
The effect of shuttle heat losses on the P-V diagram is also investigated. Fig. 4.2 shows

frequency of 7.5 Hz when the analysis is performed first without including shuttle heat
losses and then including it in the differential equations. It is noticeable that the P-V loop
seems to become slenderer when shuttle heat losses are incorporated in the differential
equation. This is because when heat is shuttled from compression space to expansion
space, the pressure difference between the two spaces decreases. This resulted in a
lower area enclosed in the P-V diagram, and therefore a lower cooling production.



4.2/     E FFECT OF W ORKING FLUID ON COOLING PERFORMANCE

It is well known that the type of working fluid has an impact on performance of the Stirling
machine. For Stirling engine with high temperature difference, helium has better work-
ing characteristics. However, for low lower temperature difference applications, air and
nitrogen could also have comparable performance with helium as presented in [83].
The impact of different working fluids on the cooling power of a Stirling refrigerator with
respect to operating frequency is presented in Fig. 4.3 at particular operating conditions
of T h = 300K, T cr = 270K, and a charging pressure of 17.5 bar. It can be observed that
the cooling production increases with the operating frequency for all working fluids types.
Furthermore, it can be seen that air and nitrogen can produce more cooling power than
helium and hydrogen gases. The potential reason for the lesser cooling performance of
helium or hydrogen is due to the fact that the amount of working fluids are much lower as
they have very high gas constant compared with that of air or nitrogen. Hence a lower
heat removal rate take place in case of helium and hydrogen gases that can result in

lower cooling production. On the other hand, the cooling production for air and nitrogen
is almost the same. This is because the fluid mass flux is almost the same.
Fig. 4.4 demonstrates the effect of different working fluids on the COP of a cooling ma-
chine with respect to operating frequency at T h = 300K, T cr = 270K, and charging pres-
sure of 17.5 bar. It can be seen that air and nitrogen have better COP than helium and
hydrogen within the range of operating frequency. Even though, both input power require-
ment and cooling power increase with operating frequency, COP decreases as a result of
a higher rate of increase of fluid flow friction and mechanical friction losses. The COP for
air and nitrogen decreases radically with operating frequency and this trend shows that
at very high operating frequency, the COP for helium may be higher than the COP of air
and nitrogen.
Fig. 4.5 displays the influence of working fluids (air, nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen) on
cooling power with respect to charging pressure at T h = 300K, T cr = 270K, and a operating
frequency of 7.5 Hz. It can be observed that the cooling power increases with charging
pressure for all working fluids. Furthermore, it could be observed that the cooling power
for air and nitrogen is greater than the cooling power of helium and hydrogen due to the
higher mass flow rate in the case of air and nitrogen which leads to a higher heat removal
rate.

hydrogen at lower average pressure especially for pressure less than 30 bar. COP for
almost all types of fluids show a wider dome shaped trend as a function of pressure. The
COP for nitrogen increases from 0.35 to 1.06 as the charging pressure increases from
10 bar to 25 bar. The COPs for helium and hydrogen increase radically with charging
pressure due to the lower rate of increase in flow friction losses and increased mass flux.
At higher pressure the difference in mass flux between different working fluids decreases.



4.3/     E FFECT OF OPERATING PARAMETERS ON COOLING PERFOR -
         MANCE

In this part of the analysis, the effects of operating parameters such as charging pressure,
operating frequency, and temperature (cold and hot ends) of the cooling machine on the
refrigerator performance are investigated. The analysis is conducted with the variation
of operating parameters keeping constant the design parameters. The effect of opera-
tional parameters on the PV-diagram as well as on the pressure drop in heat exchangers
have been investigated. The input power requirement, cooling power, and coefficient
of performance are evaluated at different operating parameters. Then, the trends and
the optimum performance values of the refrigerator are identified in each case within the
range of analysis.
Even though the operating frequency and average operating pressure of Stirling refrig-
erating machine are known to have a significant influence on machine in terms of its
power demand and cooling production, the exact operating effect of these parameters
are not well known. The variation of PV diagram as functions of operating frequency and
charging pressure have been investigated in order to predict the operating condition of

the machine.
Fig. 4.7a and b demonstrate the effect of operating frequency on the PV diagram at
6 Hz and 12 Hz respectively. The compression volume pressure range remains almost
constant and the expansion volume pressure variations are highly reduced as operating
frequency increases from 6 to 12 Hz. The PV curve area of expansion space is quite
different for low and high machine frequencies. The reduction of the PV diagram area for
the expansion space shows that as frequency increases the amount of heat transfer from
the working fluid decreases as the working fluid spends lesser time in the heat exchang-
ers including the regenerator. The working fluid also spends less time in the cold heat
exchanger (chiller) as frequency increases. However, the PV diagram in compression
spaces remains almost constant. Even though, it is expected to decrease on the other
hand as frequency increases the amount of input power increases due to the increase
of fluid friction losses, finite speed losses, and mechanical friction losses. Furthermore,
the network input will increase as operating frequency increases and this network input
is represented by the net area of compression and expansion space. The hollow curve
in expansion volume pressure curve of Fig. 4.7b, shows that the higher pressure drop is
around 40o − 60o crank angle and is more critical as the operating frequency increases.
This results from a higher mass flow rate in heat exchangers including the regenerator
achieved at a maximum value near 50o as demonstrated in Fig. 3.10 and causes a higher
pressure drop. This is also confirmed in section 4.4 of this research work.
Similarly, the effect of charging pressure on the PV diagram has been investigated as
shown in Fig. 4.8, where PV curves of the two chambers of the Stirling refrigerator are
compared for the cases of 15 bar and 25 bar. The lowest and highest pressures inside
the compression space were about 11.7 bar and 18.9 bar and the lowest and highest
pressures in expansion spaces were about 13.9 bar and 16.6 bar when the charging

and expansion space at (T cr = 270 K, T h = 300 K, and P = 17.5 bar).



pressure is 15 bar. At a charging pressure of 25 bar, the lowest and highest pressures
inside the compression space were about 19.6 bar and 31.5 bar and the lowest and
highest pressures in expansion spaces were about 23 bar and 27.7 bar. As shown in the
figure, the area for both PV diagrams of compression and expansion spaces increases as
pressure increased from 15 bar to 25 bar. The net increase in area compression space is
higher than the net increase in the area of expansion space as pressure increases. This
confirms that the net power demand per cycle increases with charging pressure.
The variation of power demand, as a function of the operating frequency of the Stirling
machine predicted by the developed modified simple numerical model for the Stirling
refrigerator is studied and presented in Fig. 4.9. At this particular figure, the Stirling
refrigerator was simulated at an ambient temperature of 300 K, chiller temperature of
270 K, and air as a working fluid. The analysis is conducted with operating frequency
ranging from 1-12 Hz and charging pressure from 5-25 bar. The higher the pressure,
the higher the input power requirement. This is because the increase in pressure of the
Stirling refrigerator leads to an increase of the work done on the fluid and an increase in
the mass of working fluid that would result in higher fluid friction (pressure) losses which
require more power to drive the refrigerator.
The input power initially increases nearly linear and increases at a higher rate with an
increase in operating frequency and in a good agreement with [132]. This indicates that
the fluid friction and mechanical friction power losses increase more at higher rotation

frequencies. On the other hand, as operating frequency increases, the number of cycles
per time increases which demands higher power. Hence, the power demand increases
with charging pressure as well as with operating frequency.
Fig. 4.10 illustrates the effect of operating frequency on the cooling power of the Stirling
refrigerator when the charging pressure is ranging from 5-25 bar, at an ambient tem-
perature of 300 K, chiller temperature of 270 K, and air as a working fluid. The cooling
power increases with charging pressure. This is because as the cooling machine charg-
ing pressure increases, the mass of working fluid increases that results in a higher heat
removal rate and hence higher cooling power. Furthermore, it could be seen from this
figure that cooling power increases linearly with an increase in operating frequency. In
other words, increasing the operating frequency of the Stirling refrigerator will result in
higher cooling power at the fixed cooling temperature. This is because as operating fre-
quency increases, the thermodynamic cycle accompanied per unit time also increases,
which results in higher cooling production at the chiller end. Therefore, a particular cool-
ing power with a specific frequency and charging pressure could be found either at a
lower frequency with increased charging pressure or at a higher frequency with decreased
charging pressure. Hence, the choices of operating frequency and charging pressure are
dependent on the cooling temperature requirement and the choice of a better COP of the
machine.
In Fig. 4.11, the trend of COP as a function of operating frequency at different charging
pressure is demonstrated. As COP is the ratio of cooling power and input power require-
ment, it can easily be determined from Fig. 4.9 and Fig. 4.10. As can be seen in Fig.4.9
and Fig. 4.10, the cooling power increases nearly linearly and the input power initially

increases nearly linearly and increases at a higher rate with an increase in operating fre-
quency (also confirmed by [132]). On the other hand, even though both cooling power
and power demand increase with operating frequency, the increase in power demand
is higher than the increase in cooling power. This results in a reduction in COP of the
cooling machine with an increase in frequency. COP shows a maximum value with re-
spect to operating frequency and this was also described in [130]. The optimum point of
COP varies with the charging pressure. The higher the charging pressure, the lower the
frequency in which the optimum COP found. This may be due to the fact that at higher
pressure, fluid friction increases the overall power demand at higher rate with increase in
operating frequency and hence the COP will tend to reach its optimum value at relatively
lower frequency.
On the other hand, the COP increases with charging pressure, this is because the effect
of an increase of mass of working fluid with charge pressure on heat removal rate is
higher than the increase of fluid friction. Furthermore, the higher the pressure the lower
the operating frequency in which the optimum COP is found. This is because the rate of
increase of fluid friction losses is higher at higher pressure.

pressure, frequency, and cold end temperature on different losses have been analyzed.
The variation of pressure drops across the regenerator and heat exchangers have been
investigated as functions of operating frequency and charging pressure in order to predict
the extent of fluid friction losses. Fig. 4.12a and b demonstrates the effect of operating
frequency on pressure drop in the regenerator and two heat exchangers respectively for
operating frequencys of 6 Hz and 12 Hz. It can be confirmed that the pressure drop
increases with frequency. This is due to the fact that as frequency increases friction be-
tween flowing working fluid and heat exchanger solid surface increases as also described
by [66]. For instance, the maximum pressure drop in regenerator increases from 0.81 bar
to 2.83 bar which is 252% increase as frequency increases from 6 Hz to 12 Hz. Further-
more, the pressure drops in chiller and hot heat exchanger (HHX) increase by 230% and
233% respectively as operating frequency increases from 6 Hz to 12 Hz. Generally, oper-
ating frequency has critical impact on the overall pressure drop across heat exchangers.
Most importantly, the pressure drop especially in regenerator has a large share on the
total pressure drop and it also increases at higher rate with frequency.

ers.

The effect of charging pressure on the pressure drop across regenerator and heat ex-
changers have been also investigated as shown in Fig. 4.13, where the pressure drops
of regenerator as well as other heat exchanges of a Stirling refrigerator are compared for
the cases of 15 bar and 25 bar. From Fig. 4.13a, it could be observed that the pressure
drop in the regenerator increases by 53% as pressure increase from 15 bar to 25 bar.
Similarly, Fig. 4.13b demonstrates the pressure drops in chiller and hot heat exchanger
(HHX) increases by 46.5% and 47.3% respectively as charging pressure increase from
15 bar to 25 bar. Hence, the pressure drop in regenerator has a large share on overall
pressure drop and it also increases at higher rate with pressure. It means the fluid fric-
tion power loss increases with increase in charging especially due to pressure drop in

Fig. 4.14a, b, c, and d illustrate the effect of operating frequency on the major power
losses, major heat power losses, cooling power, and COP respectively at an ambient
temperature of 300 K, chiller temperature of 270 K, and charging pressure of 17.5 bar. As
demonstrated in Fig. 4.14a, except for gas hysteresis power losses, all power losses are
majorly affected by operating frequency. Fluid friction losses increase strongly at a higher
frequency. As it is shown in Fig. 4.14b regenerator imperfection loss linearly increases as
it depends on mass flow rate of fluid based on Eq. 3.3.2 which is affected by frequency
and all other heat power losses relatively remain unchanged with the operating frequency.
From Fig. 4.14c, it can be seen that cooling power increases with an increase in operating
frequency. This is mainly due to the increase in the thermodynamic cycle per unit time.
Lastly, as it is seen in Fig. 4.14d, COP decreases with an increase in operating frequency.
This is expected as demonstrated in Fig. 4.14a and 4.14b, both power and heat power
losses increase which resulted in lower COP at a higher frequency.
Fig. 4.15a,b, c, and d illustrate the percentage share of different power and heat power
losses as a function of charging pressure and operating frequency at an ambient tem-
perature of 300 K and chiller temperature of 270 K. In Fig. 4.15a, the effect of charging
pressure on the share of different power losses at an operating frequency of 7.5 Hz has
been presented. It is clear from the figure that the share of fluid friction loss and loss
due to finite speed increase and the share of mechanical friction loss decreases with
an increase in the average pressure of the cooling machine. Furthermore, the major
share is accounted for mechanical friction loss varies from 60% to 41.6% and fluid friction
loss varies from 31.3% to 44% as the average pressure varies from 10 bar to 25 bar.
Fig. 4.15b, illustrate the effect of average pressure on the share of different heat power
losses at an operating frequency of 7.5 Hz. As it can be seen from this Fig. 4.15b, the

share of regenerator imperfection loss increases and the shares of all other heat power
losses decrease with an increase in the average pressure of the cooling machine.
The effects of operating frequency on the share of different power and heat power losses
have been presented in Fig. 4.15c and 4.15d respectively. It is clear from Fig. 4.15c
that, even though all power losses increase with operating frequency (as described in
Fig. 4.14a), the share of fluid friction losses increases and the share of mechanical fric-
tion loss decreases with an increase in the operating frequency of the cooling machine.
Furthermore, the shares of the major power losses (mechanical friction and fluid flow
friction losses) vary from 54.4% to 37% and from 31.8% to 51.9%, respectively, as the
operating frequency increases from 6.5 to 14 Hz. The shares of other power losses are
less affected by the change in the frequency of the machine. As shown in Fig. 4.15d and
similar to Fig. 4.15b the share of regenerator imperfection loss increases and the shares
of all other heat power losses decrease with an increase in the average pressure of the
cooling machine.
To evaluate the share of percentage of different losses at different pressures, the numer-
ical model is simulated with different operating frequency for a fixed charging pressure
and the average share of losses have been computed. The variation of shares of differ-
ent losses on overall losses of respective category at charging pressures of 17.5 bar and

25 bar are presented Fig. 4.16. In Fig. 4.16 a and c, the average share of different power
losses are presented at charging pressures of 17.5 bar and 25 respectively. As it is clearly
shown in Fig. 4.16a, at a pressure of 17.5 bar from the total power loss of 3296 W, the
major loss is mechanical friction loss (48%), followed by fluid friction loss due to pressure
drop (40%). Others cover only 12% of the total power loss. Whereas, at a pressure of
25 bar as shown in Fig. 4.16c, from the total power loss of 3888 W, the major loss is fluid
friction losses (45%) and followed by mechanical friction losses (41%). This is because
as pressure increases fluid friction in a forced fluid flow increases.
Similarly, the variation of shares of different heat power losses at charging pressures of
17.5 bar and 25 bar are presented Fig. 4.16b, and d respectively. As it is clearly shown in
Fig. 4.16b, at a pressure of 17.5 bar from the total power loss of 1210 W, the major loss is
regenerator imperfection loss (74%). Other losses cover only 26% of the total heat power
loss. At a pressure of 25 bar as shown in Fig. 4.16d, from the total power loss of 1771 W,
the major loss is still regenerator imperfection (81%) and which shows that the share of
this loss increases with charging pressure.
Generally, as pressure increases the shares of fluid friction power losses, regenerator
imperfection loss, and loss due to finite speed of piston increase and the shares of other

losses decrease. Hence, when designing Stirling refrigerator with higher pressure, the
fluid friction, regenerator imperfection and finite speed losses shall get great concern.
Most importantly, the impact of losses associated with regenerator (fluid friction and re-
generator imperfection losses) on the Stirling refrigerator performance will increase.

Fig. 4.17a, b, c and d illustrate the effect of cold end temperature on the major power
losses, major heat power losses, cooling power, and COP respectively at an ambient
temperature of 300 K, charging pressure of 17.5 bar, and an operating frequency of 7.5
Hz. As demonstrated in Fig. 4.17a, almost all power losses are not majorly affected by
the cold end temperature. On the other hand, Fig. 4.17b shows the effect of cold side
temperature on different heat power losses. As it can be seen from Fig. 4.17b, all heat
power losses decrease with an increase in cold end temperature. This is because as
the temperature difference lowers, the heat transfer losses due to temperature gap will
also decrease. Especially, regenerator imperfection loss decreases remarkably with an
increase in cold end temperature. Fig. 4.17c, investigates the effect of cold end tempera-
ture on the cooling power of the refrigerating machine. It is seen that due to the decrease
of heat power losses, cooling power increases with an increase in cold temperature and
it is confirmed by [132]. Lastly, Fig. 4.17d, demonstrates the relation between cold end
temperature and COP of the cooling machine. As seen in Fig. 4.17a and 4.17b the power
losses relatively remain constant and the decreasing of heat power losses respectively
resulted in increasing in COP with an increase in cold end temperature.

Fig. 4.18a, b, c, and d represent the effect of hot/ambient temperature on the major
power losses, major heat power losses, cooling power, and COP respectively at a cold
temperature of 270 K, charging pressure of 17.5 bar, and an operating frequency of 7.5
bar. As demonstrated in Fig. 4.18a, almost all power losses are not majorly affected
by the hot end temperature. On the other hand, Fig. 4.18b shows the effect of hot side
temperature on different heat power losses. It could be seen from Fig. 4.18b, all heat
power losses increase with an increase in hot end temperature because the temperature
gap is increased. Especially, regenerator imperfection loss increases remarkably with an
increase in hot-end temperature. Fig. 4.18c, illustrates the effect of hot-end temperature
on the cooling power of the refrigerating machine. It is seen that due to the increase of
heat power losses, cooling power decreases with an increase in ambient temperature.
Fig. 4.18d, demonstrates the relationship between ambient temperature and COP of the
cooling machine. As seen in Fig. 4.18a, 4.18b, and 4.18c, due to the decreasing of
cooling power without much variation on input power, the COP shows a similar trend as
that of cooling power and it decreases with increasing of hot−end temperature.
As the COP of a refrigerator is a function of temperature, so it is convenient to adopt per-
cent of Carnot COP to evaluate the performance of the Stirling refrigerator. The latest sur-
vey of cryocooler performance with different cooling capacities has been presented [63].

The survey result shows that the percentage of Carnot COP significantly increases with
the cooling capacity. Fig.4.19 depicts the percentage of actual COP to the Carnot COP,
(COP/COPc ) at different cooling temperatures for domestic Stirling refrigerators at oper-
ating frequencies of 7.5 and 10 Hz. As it is seen in the figure, the percent of Carnot COP
monotonously decreases and actual COP monotonously increases with an increase in
cooling temperature. Accordingly, Fig. 4.19, the percentage of Carnot COP (COP/COPc )
is higher at 7.5 Hz than at 10 Hz in all temperature ranges analyzed. The differential of
temperature is very low in our case which results in a very high Carnot COP. This resulted
in relatively lower percentage Carnot COP as compared with other research findings (for
instance as compared with [149]). This is because at very low temperature differential
adiabatic nature of heat exchangers will limit heat transfer rate and then rate of increase
of cooling will be limited.

4.5.1/   E FFECT   OF PHASE ANGLE


The phase advance of expansion space volume variations with respect to compression
space variations is represented by phase angle. The phase angle determines the dynam-
ics of piston−displacer movements and thus the volume variation during the cycle which
is directly related to the work input and output. The effect of phase angle on cooling power
and coefficient of performance have been indicated in Figs. 4.20 and 4.21.
Fig. 4.20 has presented that there is a single optimum angle (considering cooling power)
for a single type of working fluid investigated at different operating frequencies using
FEMTO 60 machine model. It should be noted that the optimum phase angle has been
found as 90o and 95o for air and helium respectively. These obtained phase angles agree
closely with the result provided for the engine by [146]. It could be stated that the optimum
phase angle for gases like air with lower thermal capacity is lower.
Fig. 4.21 has demonstrated the COP of a Stirling refrigerator as a function of the phase
angle. It has shown that the optimum phase angle for peak COP is different from the
optimum phase angle for cooling capacity. Furthermore, the optimum phase angle for the
peak COP varies with respect to the operating frequency, and the optimum phase angle
for COP is mostly higher than the optimum phase angle for cooling power. The higher
the operating frequency, the lower the optimum angle. Generally, the optimum COP with
respect of phase angle varies with operating frequency as fluid friction loss depends both
on operating frequency and phase angle(as it affects swept volume).

4.5.2/   E FFECT   OF LENGTH AND POROSITY OF REGENERATOR

The regenerator is an essential part of Stirling machines as it recovers a great part of the
thermal energy of the working fluid. On the other hand, regenerator is typically the largest
source of power loss in the system. Hence, the effects of regenerator parameters should
be investigated based on the application of the Stirling machine. In this research, the
effect of the most important parameters of the regenerator that are length and porosity of
regenerator have been investigated as shown in Figs. 4.22 and 4.24, respectively. For
optimization of the regenerator parameters, while keeping other parameters constant and
one parameter subsequently has been made to vary.
Fig. 4.22 has shown that the performance of a Stirling refrigerator is higher at a relatively
smaller length of the regenerator. The figure shows that both cooling power and COP
demonstrate parabolic evolution with nearly the same optimum value at 25 mm of the re-
generator length. It could be stated that both cooling power and COP show a decreasing
trend as the regenerator length increases after the optimum value. This phenomenon
results from decreasing of most of the heat losses and increasing of fluid friction loss
with regenerator length as demonstrated in Fig.4.23. From Fig. 4.23, it could be un-
derstood that regenerator imperfection loss decreases and fluid friction loss increases
at higher rate than other losses. Hence, the main reason for the decreasing of cooling
performance is due to the fact that increasing fluid friction loss and the decreasing of
regenerator imperfection loss with increase in regenerator length. As the length of the re-
generator increases, fluid friction loss will increase which will result in lower performance
of the Stirling refrigerator. The optimum design point for the case of regenerator length is
therefore at a smaller length as much as possible for both cooling power and COP for the
choosen porosity of 0.64.

ity. Fig. 4.24 shows the impact of regenerator porosity on the cooling performance of the

Stirling refrigerator. It has shown that, within the range of the analysis, cooling power
decreases with an increase in regenerator porosity and COP has the maximum value at
relatively higher porosity. While the porosity of the regenerator increases, the heat trans-
fer area of the matrix and the amount the heat transfer decreases. The working gas goes
into the heater at a higher temperature. Thus the cooling production of the refrigerator
decreases with an increase in porosity. On the other hand, due to a higher pressure drop,
a low porosity regenerator requires higher input power to get the same pressure ratio to
compress the working fluid compared to that of the high porosity regenerator. Thus the
COP decreases at lower porosity. The curve shows that the optimum COP value is found
at a porosity of 0.75 which is similar to the research conducted by [89]. The decreasing
of cooling power with increase in porosity is due to the increasing of regenerator imper-
fection loss as demonstrated in Fig 4.25. Fig 4.25 also demonstrates the decreasing of
fluid friction with increase inregenerator porosity which will tend to increase COP. On the
other hand, regenerator imperfection loss increases at higher rate than the decreasing
rate of fluid friction loss just after a porosity value of 0.75 that results in an optimum COP.
Hence, the optimum design point in case of regenerator porosity could be at a compro-
mise between maximum cooling power and maximum COP.

Fig. 4.26 demonstrates the effect of seal clearance between piston and cylinder on cool-
ing performance (cooling production and COP). Both cooling power and COP decrease
with a wider dome shape as a function of piston seal clearance. This is because as the
piston seal clearance increases mass leakage to the buffer space increases as confirmed
by [157]. It could be seen from Fig. 4.26 that the slope of decreasing of cooling produc-
tion and COP increases more steeply at larger clearance gap as large quantity of mass

4.5.4/    E FFECT   OF DISPLACER HEIGHT AND DISPLACER GAP


Stirling refrigerator designs utilize displacers as a means of transferring the working fluid
between the cold and hot regions of the device. In this research, the effects of dis-
placer height and displacer clearance on cooling power and COP have been investigated.
The height of the displacer affects the performance of the Stirling machine by changing
the compression ratio as the swept volume of compression space varies with displacer
height [158].
In this analysis, the height of the displacer is allowed to vary, still keeping the total length
(height and length displacer rod) of the displacer fixed. As displacer height increases,
keeping the total length fixed, the compression volume decreases, that results in a lower
swept volume compression ratio. Fig. 4.27 has presented the impact of displacer height
on cooling performance (cooling production and COP) using air as a working fluid at a
charging pressure of 17.5 bar, operating frequency of 7.5 Hz, the hot−side temperature
of 300 K, and chiller temperature of 270 K.
It has been noticed from the Fig. 4.27, that cooling power decreases monotonously with
displacer height and there exists a peak value of COP. The peak COP value is found
0.72 at a displacer height of 10 cm with the associated cooling production of 544.4 W
and a swept volume compression ratio of 1.58. Hence, with the same operating condition
and keeping all other parameters constant, we could increase the peak cold production
and COP by 61.6% and 13.3%, respectively only through displacer height optimization
and associated compression space swept volume variation. The main reason for such
improvement in cooling performance is the increase of mass of working fluid with the in-
crease in compression space swept volume and increasing of swept volume compression
ratio. Generally, the analysis confirms that shorter displacers with relatively higher swept

volume compression ratios show better performance for such types of domestic Stirling
refrigerators.




       Figure 4.28: Cooling production and COP versus displacer clearance size.

Displacer clearance is another parameter that affects the cooling performance of the Stir-
ling refrigerator. Fig. 4.28 demonstrates the effect of displacer clearance on cooling per-
formance (cooling production and COP). Both cooling power and COP increase with a
wider dome shape as a function of displacer clearance and the finding is similar to the re-

search work conducted on Stirling cryocooler by [132]. For an increase in displacer clear-
ance from 80µm (design point) to 300µm, the cooling power increase by about 23.5% and
the COP increases by about 19.2%. This effect is mainly due to the shuttle heat losses.
As shown in Fig.4.29, shuttle heat losses decreases with an increase in clearance be-
tween displacer and cylinder. However, there will be a peak value of COP as regenerator
effectiveness loss increases and fluid friction loss decreases due to decreased mass flow
through the regenerator. Furthermore, the optimum COP and cooling power will exist at
relatively lower clearance gap, if we incorporate the enthalpy loss in the differential equa-
tion. This is because as displacer clearance increases, shuttle heat loss decreases and
enthalpy loss increases and there will be optimum point of clearance gap. Still at such
low speed and low temperature differential machine the effect of enthalpy loss is relatively
small.



4.5.5/   E FFECT   OF SWEPT VOLUME RATIO


The swept volume ratio also greatly affects the performance of the Stirling machine. When
we assume that the working fluid is an ideal gas, and the refrigerator is an ideal refrig-
erator in which the pressure loss can be ignored, then the swept volume ratio for the
optimum performance of the machine equals to the ratio of the working fluid temperature
in the compression space to that in the expansion space. However, in an actual refriger-
ator, the optimal value may be shifted due to its configuration and other factors. In this
study, the effects of the volume ratio on the performance of the Stirling refrigerator have
been examined numerically. Fig. 4.30 demonstrates the effect of the ratio of swept vol-
ume on cooling production and COP of the Stirling refrigerator at T h =300 K, T cr =270 K,
charging pressure of 17.5 bar, and an operating frequency of 7.5 Hz using air as a work-
ing fluid. It can be seen from Fig. 4.30 that cooling production and COP of the Stirling

refrigerator as a function of volume ratio are not monotonic and there exist peak values.
The peaks for cooling production and COP values are found to be 383.6 W and 0.7, re-
spectively at a swept volume ratio of 1.7. Hence, with the same operating condition and
keeping all other parameters constant, we could increase the peak cold production and
COP by 11.8% and 10.9%, respectively only through swept volume ratio optimization.
The analysis is conducted by keeping the total volume constant and still varying the two
swept volumes vary through changing strokes of the displacer and power piston.




          Figure 4.30: Cooling production and COP versus swept volume ratio.

Both Fig. 4.27 and Fig. 4.30 show the effect of volume ratio on the performance of the
Stirling refrigerator keeping the overall cylinder volume fixed. However, in Fig. 4.27, due
to the variation of displacer height, the swept volume of compression space varies keep-
ing the swept volume of expansion space fixed. Whereas, in Fig. 4.30, both compression
and expansion spaces vary keeping the summation of the two swept volumes still fixed.
Hence, Fig. 4.31, illustrates the COP of the Stirling refrigerator as a function of swept vol-
ume ratio for the comparison of these two cases. It is seen in Fig. 4.31 that a better COP
could be achieved when the volume ratio variation is due to the variation of compres-
sion space swept volume with displacer height and still keeping the total cylinder volume
fixed. Furthermore, it could also be concluded from this figure that the optimum cooling
performance for the domestic Stirling refrigerator can be found for the swept volume ratio
ranging from 1.4 to 1.8.


4.5.6/    E FFECT   OF RATIO OF DIAMETER TO STROKE OF PISTON

Fig. 4.32 shows the cooling production and COP variation versus the ratio of diameter to
stroke of the piston keeping the piston swept volume constant (presented inTable 3.5). It
can be seen that both cooling power and COP increase in a wide dome-shaped trend with
an increase in diameter to piston stroke. This phenomenon is mainly due to the variation

of different power losses with the ratio as can be seen in Fig. 4.33. The effect of ratio
of diameter to stroke of piston has been also investigated by [131]. It can be seen from
Fig. 4.33a that the total power loss decreases mainly due to the decreasing of mechanical
friction and piston finite speed losses as the stroke of piston decreases with an increase
in ratio (dP /s). On other hand, even though conduction heat loss increases, since shuttle
heat losses decreases (see Fig. 4.33b) cooling production increases in a wider dome
shape as the ratio (dP /s) increases. Generally, the cooling production and COP increase
by 17.3% and 32 % as the ratio (dP /s) increases from 1.2 to 2.6.



4.6/     E FFECT OF COMBINED OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS

In the previous sections of this chapter, we use uni-variant analysis in which only one
parameter is investigated while all other parameters are retained to pre-fixed values. This
approach is simplistic and allows us to assess the most influential parameters. However,
in only uni-variant optimization, it would be difficult to find the best combination of param-
eters for optimum machine performance. Hence, for the second-order numerical model,
after investigating single parameter optimization, a trade-off between multiple conflicting
parameters is indispensable.
Therefore, in this section, we try to investigate parameters with better performance as
presented in sections 4.3 and 4.5, then combine them to find an optimized combination.
Number of different combination of parameters which have positive impact on cooling
performance have been first selected. These different combinations were simulated and

Regarding, operating parameter optimization, it can be seen from the optimized results
presented in section 4.3 that relatively the lower operating frequency (3 to 8 Hz) at higher
charging pressure are found to be the optimum operating parameters. But, due to the
restricted operating conditions of the machine for safe working conditions and to minimize
manufacturing cost, the average proposed operating frequency and charging pressure
are set as 6 Hz and 22.5 bar, respectively.
The major design parameters considered for the analysis of combined parameters are
regenerator length, porosity, displacer gap, swept volume ratio, and diameter to stroke
ratio of the piston. It is found that all five optimized design parameters that are quite
influential as individual parameters could enhance the COP of the refrigerator from 7%
to 19% from the existing design value. Collectively, the optimized parameters (operating
and specified design parameters) could deliver from 48% to 60 % more cold production
and from 30% to 40% more COP than the existing design in a safe working condition.
At a proposed average pressure of 22.5 bar and average frequency of 6 Hz, using the
optimized parameters it is possible to achieve COP of 1.3, cold production of 625 W at a
temperature of −4o C.

4.7/     CONCLUSIONS

In this chapter, univariate analysis and optimization have been conducted to investigate
the effect of parameters on the cooling performance of the Stirling refrigerator. The effects
of different working fluids, shuttle heat losses, mass leakage, operating parameters (op-
erating frequency, charging pressure, cold and hot temperature) and design parameters
(phase angle between the oscillations of piston and displacer, length of the regenerator,
porosity of regenerator, displacer height, displacer gap, piston-cylinder clearance gap,
swept volume ratio, and piston diameter to stroke ratio) have been investigated. The
effects of the inclusion of shuttle heat losses and mass leakage loss directly in the dif-
ferential equations have been computed. The cold production and COP of the Stirling
refrigerator have been computed for different working fluids. Input power requirement,
cold production, COP, and the trends of major losses have been studied as a function of
operating parameters. Moreover, the effects of operating frequency and charging pres-
sure on the PV diagram of working spaces (compression and expansion) and pressure
drops in heat exchangers have been investigated. The trend of cold production as well
as COP of a refrigerating machine, are investigated as a function of design parameters.
The analysis is conducted with the variation of a single parameter, keeping constant the
other parameters at the design condition. Then, sets of analysis have been conducted
using combination of optimized parameters. Finally, optimized parameters have been
proposed. Some of the main results of this study are summarized below.

   • To design Stirling machines, losses that a have direct effect on working condition
     of working fluid shall be directly incorporated with the differential equations. This is
     demonstrated with the analysis results of shuttle heat losses and mass leakages as
     independent losses as well as through direct incorporation in differential equations.

      The result shows large variation in cooling performance.

  • Air and nitrogen have resulted in better cooling performance as compared with he-
    lium and hydrogen for such domestic refrigeration within the range of analysis.

  • The pressures in the compression volume remains unchanged and it reduced in
    expansion volume with an increase in operating frequency. These results in a de-
    crease in cold production per cycle with an increase in operating frequency. How-
    ever, as frequency increases the cycle per unit time increases and the total cold
    production increases.

  • The cold production and input power requirement increase with the operating fre-
    quency. However, the increase in input power requirement accelerates at a higher
    rate at higher frequencies due to the increase in power losses especially fluid fric-
    tion power losses, and hence COP decreases after some particular operating fre-
    quency. Then, COP has a maximum value as a function of operating frequency. On
    the other hand, COP increases with charging pressure. Furthermore, the higher the
    pressure, the lower the operating frequency in which the peak COP is found. This
    is because the rate of the increase of power losses especially fluid friction losses is
    higher at higher pressure.

  • Cooling production has peak values at a single phase angle as a function of oper-
    ating frequency. Whereas, the phase angle for the optimum COP increases slightly
    with an operating frequency. The point of optimum cooling performance as a func-
    tion of phase angle is independent with type of working fluids.

  • In optimizing the regenerator parameter, a relatively shorter regenerator gives an
    optimum cooling performance. The optimum regenerator length with the existing
    arrangement is found to be 25 mm as the peak values for both cold production and
    COP co-exist at this point. Cold production decreases and there exists a peak value
    of COP as porosity increases.

  • Shorter displacers with relatively higher compression ratios show better perfor-
    mance for such types of domestic Stirling refrigerators as the swept volume com-
    pression volume increases.

  • Cooling performance drops rapidly with an increase in clearance gap between pis-
    ton and cylinder due to the increase in mass leakage loss.

  • It could be seen from the optimized results presented in section 4.3 that relatively
    the lower operating frequency (3 to 8 Hz) at higher charging pressure are found to
    be the optimum operating parameters.

  • Using combined parametric optimization, a higher performance Stirling refrigera-
    tor could bee designed. In this research, optimized design parameters that could
    enhance the overall performance of the existing machine from 30% to 60% are pro-
    posed. The optimized design for such domestic Stirling refrigeration could have a
    COP of 1.3 and cooling power of 625 W at a cooling temperature of −4o C.

5.1/     C ONCLUSION

In recent decades, the demand for cooling systems has been increased for different ap-
plications including in domestic buildings, commercial halls, public spaces, transportation
systems, manufacturing processes, and military affairs. This is due to the continuous
increase in population and global warming mostly resulted from expansion of industri-
alization. Hence, alternative technologies with lower environmental impact have been
demanded. Stirling cycle refrigerator for domestic cooling application is found to be a
potential candidate to the current technology.
This study set out first to describe the overview of the Stirling refrigerating machine and
its associated researches carried out in the area so far. A detailed review of literature
has been conducted including configuration and drive mechanisms of the technology,
thermodynamic modeling techniques developed so far, reviews of lower temperature cry-
ocoolers as well as domestic Stirling refrigerators. The research gaps and potentials of
development have been identified. From the review, it has been pointed out that Stirling
refrigerator for domestic application is not well researched, it is still a potential area of
further study as well as a promising technology. In the review, second order numerical
model could be used for the design and optimization of Stirling machine with reasonable
accuracy as well as with very less computational time. Furthermore, it could be easy
to identify the type and effect of different losses so that further optimization will be easy
through minimizing such major losses.
A key issue in the optimal designing of a Stirling machine is to develop a precise ther-
modynamic numerical model that could predict the performances and provide means for
further optimization. In this paper, a non-ideal second-order numerical model called modi-
fied simple analysis model has been developed for the Stirling cycle refrigerating machine.
The modified simple model constructed by directly incorporating the shuttle heat losses
by displacer movement and mass leakage to the crankcase in the differential equations
and treating other losses (imperfect regeneration loss, internal heat conduction loss in
the regenerator, losses due to pressure drop in heat exchangers, heat conduction losses,
gas spring hysteresis loss, mechanical friction loss, loss due to piston finite speed, and
pumping loss) as independent losses. The classical fourth-order Runge Kutta method
is applied to solve the system of the differential equations by taking the geometrical pa-
rameters and initial operating conditions of the machine as input parameters. Then, a
MATLAB code is adapted to solve the system of these differential equations over consec-
utive cycles.

The results of numerical investigation have been compared in two ways to validate the
model. First, it is validated with engine models by reversing the numerical model to the
engine model and the parameters of the 3kW GPU-3 Stirling engine are used for vali-
dation. The simulation results of the reversed numerical model are compared with the
previous theoretical research results as well as experimental results. Second, the simula-
tion results of the numerical model (refrigeration) are compared with experimental results
(refrigeration) conducted in the FEMTO-ST laboratory using the FEMTO-60 engine model
in a cooling mode.
Finally, parametric optimizations have been conducted after validating the model to find
the optimum combination of parameters. The study on parametric optimization con-
tributes to the understanding of the effect of different operating and design parameters
on power demand, cooling power, and COP as well as on the trend of major losses as-
sociated with the cooling machine. In this part, the effect of shuttle heat losses and mass
leakage loss as well as effect of working fluid have been investigated with respect to oper-
ating parameters. The major optimized parameters were operating (operating frequency,
charging pressure, hot and cold temperatures) and design (phase angle, regenerator
porosity, regenerator length, displacer gap, displacer height, swept volume ratio, and di-
ameter to stroke ratio of piston) parameters. Some of the main findings are summarized
below


   • The developed numerical model is for Beta type configuration. However the cooling
     capacity is related to compression ratio which is dependent on mechanical configu-
     ration. Then, the model could be extended to other mechanical drives by modifying
     the volume variation law, considering two cylinders instead of one for the mass leak-
     age, shuttle heat losses, finite speed of piston, and gas spring hysteresis losses.

   • The validation of the model confirm that the model could predict Stirling refrigeration
     machine with very good accuracy. Hence, the numerical model could be used for
     the design and optimization of such a machine.

   • For low temperature differential with relatively lower charge pressure applications
     like domestic Stirling refrigerator, nitrogen or air could give better performance as
     compared with helium or hydrogen.

   • As compared with other major losses (fluid friction losses, mechanical friction loss,
     regenerator imperfection loss), the amount of shuttle heat losses is very low. How-
     ever, since shuttle heat losses have direct effect on the working condition of the
     working fluid, its effect on overall performance of the Stirling machine is very com-
     parable with the effect of major losses. At a pressure of 17.5 bar and operating
     frequency of 7.5 Hz, shuttle heat decreases the cooling performance (cold produc-
     tion by more than 23% and COP by more than 19%). Hence, in designing the
     Stirling machine due attention shall be given for the reduction of shuttle heat losses.

   • Fluid friction power losses and regenerator imperfection losses are the two ma-
     jor losses that are mostly affected by charging pressure and operating frequency.
     The shares of these two losses over their respective total losses increase with an
     increase in operating frequency as well as with charging pressure. Hence, ex-
     ceptional attention shall be given to these types of losses particularly in designing
     higher operating frequency and higher charging pressure Stirling refrigerator.


5.2. PERSPECTIVES                                                                       109


   • Even though, all power and heat losses have their own effect on cooling perfor-
     mance of the Stirling refrigerator, losses that have large share will have major im-
     pact. More importantly, the share of different power and heat losses depend on
     the operating conditions (operating frequency, charging pressure and temperature
     difference between heat source and heat sink) of the machine. Hence, designing
     Stirling machine shall consider the operating condition of the machine so as to give
     prior attention for the major losses.

   • A cold production of 625 W and a COP of 1.3 have been found at a temperature of
     −4o C using optimized parameters of Stirling refrigerator at a charging pressure of
     22.5 bar and an operating frequency of 6 Hz. From such operating condition, the
     manufacturing cost of such machine could be reduced considerably as the operating
     condition do not need materials as that of the Stirling engine. Hence, it could be
     confirmed that domestic Stirling refrigerators can be a reliable alternative for the
     VCR in both cooling performance as well as cost of machine.

   • Through the optimization of combined parameters, it is possible to enhance cold
     production from 48% to 60% and COP from 30% to 40% more from the existing
     design. This suggests that designing and optimization of Stirling machine for a
     particular application could increase the performance of the machine considerably.


5.2/    P ERSPECTIVES

From the aforementioned discussions, it should be apparent that the performance of the
Stirling refrigerator could be optimized through appropriate design consideration and op-
timization of parameters. This research has thrown up many questions in need of further
investigation. To improve upon the operational performance of the Stirling refrigerator, the
following recommendations are made for further research:

   • Even though the choice of heat exchangers design and working volumes for Stirling
     machine depends on the application area, most researches that have done so far
     including this study particularly on moderate temperature Stirling cycle refrigerator
     are directly simulated and experimented by reversing the existing Stirling engine. In
     the Stirling engine, all the components are designed and manufactured to produce
     the maximum power output or efficiency. Such reversing a machine configuration
     may not produce the optimum cooling or COP. Furthermore, Stirling engines are
     designed for high temperature and high-pressure applications which demands high
     pressure and temperature resistant material for manufacturing. This increases the
     manufacturing cost of the machine. Whereas Stirling refrigerator relative demand
     ambient temperature and lesser operating pressure in which it may demand lesser
     manufacturing cost. Hence, future researches shall start with the design, produc-
     tion, and testing of the new Stirling cycle refrigerator.

   • The regenerator is known to have a large share of fluid friction loss and regener-
     ator imperfection loss. It has a higher impact on the cooling performance of the
     machine. Optimizing regenerator design will have a higher impact on improving the
     performance of the refrigerating machine. Hence, a wider variety of regenerator
     materials and configurations shall be tested and modeled for optimum refrigeration
     performance.

  • The effect of variation of bounce space volume and other non optimized design
    parameters should be investigated.

  • The effect of gas hysteresis loss on temperature and pressure of the working fluid
    as well as on the overall performance of the cooling machine has to be investigated
    through the inclusion of this loss directly in differential equations.

  • The effect of drive mechanisms including Rhombic drive shall be studied and com-
    pared with the existing crank drive mechanism for cooling machine.

The following derivations are for calculating the mass of working fluid from a specified
mean pressure. The equations derived are used in the ideal adiabatic model as a means
of quickly calculating the mass of working fluid that results in a specified mean machine
pressure for the specific engine configuration. Here, the Schmidt engine analysis equa-
tions are adapted for cooling machine. The following derivations assume that the pistons
are connected by a slider crank mechanism and that the resultant piston motion is sinu-
soidal.

The regenerator geometric and thermal properties could be analyzed as follows. First,
the area of the regenerator matrix is given by:

                                            π × (D2ro − D2ri )
                                 Amat =                                              (B.1)
                                                   4

The wall area of the regenerator housing is then given as:

                                          π × (D2rho − D2ro )
                                  Awr =                                              (B.2)
                                                  4


The area of regenerator with no matrix is given by:

                               Awgr0 = π × (Dri + Dro ) × Lr                         (B.3)

The free flow area of regenerator is given as:

                                      Ar = Amat × φ                                  (B.5)

Then, the void volume of the regenerator could be found from the free flow area and the
length of the regenerator as:
                                     Vr = Ar × Lr                                 (B.6)


                                                   φ
                                      dr = dw                                        (B.7)
                                                (1 − φ)
The total wetted area of the regenerator is then as the summation of internal and external
wetted areas as:
                                              Vr
                                   Awg = 4 ×     + Awgr0                             (B.8)
