    Titre : Télédétection par système vidéo de la dynamique des courants induits
par les vagues et de l’evolution morpholoqique des plages soumises aux houles
énergétiques

Résumé : Comprendre les circulations induites par les vagues et les évolutions mor-
phologiques du littoral est important scientifiquement et répond à une forte demande
sociétale. Toutefois l’acquisition de ces données sur le terrain est coûteuse et reste
un véritable défi logistique. Le développement de la télédétection optique combiné
à la démocratisation de plateformes vidéo et d’algorithmes ouverts d’analyse d’image
permet maintenant d’obtenir à faible cout une grande quantité d’informations sur le
littoral. Ce travail s’appuie sur techniques existantes en imagerie vidéo, et sur des nou-
veaux développements, afin d’inférer la bathymétrie de l’avant-côte et les courants dans
la zone de déferlement. Les méthodes sont validées avec une campagne de mesures
intensive sur la plage d’Anglet dans le sud-ouest de la France. Pour la première fois,
l’évolution spatiale et temporelle à la fois des courants et de la morphologie de la plage
sont étudiés en présence de vagues de tempête.

   Title : Remotely-sensed rip current dynamics and morphological control in
high-energy beach environments

Abstract : Understanding the surf zone circulation and the morphological changes
within the nearshore is essential for both scientific and societal interests. However, di-
rect measurements with in-situ instruments are logistically challenging and expensive.
The development of optical remote sensing techniques in combination with low-cost
image platforms and open-source algorithms offers the possibility of collecting large
amounts of information at a reasonable instrumental and computational cost. This
work builds on existing and new video monitoring techniques to remotely sense the
nearshore bathymetry as well as the surf zone circulation in a high-energy meso-macro
tidal beach environment, including storm events. The methods are validated against
a dense data set acquired during an intensive field campaign conducted at Anglet
beach, SW France. For the first time the temporal and spatial variability of concurrent
nearshore bathymetry and surface currents are addressed under high-energy wave
forcing.

Writing this last section of the manuscript means that this cycle is coming to an end. It
has been a great adventure and experience to work surrounded by such brilliant minds
with such humble and human personalities. Knowing that I was able to contribute
my grain of sand by collaborating with such talented scientist fills me with pride and
motivates me to continue on this (painful but satisfying) path of research. Although
there are many people to thank, I would like to start with my wife Abril and my cat
Simba, whose emotional support were essential in coping with the pandemic and the
confinement while being far away from home.

Many persons have contributed to this work (either directly or indirectly) so I
will try not to forget anyone. First of all, I’m eternally grateful to Bruno and Vincent for
believing in me and giving me the freedom to explore my curiosity under their tutelage
and expertise always in a good mood. Thanks Bruno for welcoming us into your home
with your family even though we had a cat addicted to wrestling (apologies for the
trauma caused to Osiris). You will always find a place in our home if you decide one
day to visit Mexico. Thanks Vincent for your great ideas and suggestions and for always
being available in case I got stuck with something (sorry for making you struggle using
tmux and typing on my imaginary qwerty keyboard)... I guess you will be happy to
know that the server (calcul02) will recover it’s precious memory as soon as I’m gone ;)

In the same way I want to thank Philippe and Denis for providing me with su-
pervision and insightful feedback. Thanks to all the METHYS team for integrating me
as one of their members and all the kind staff in the EPOC Lab: Aldo, Isabel, Bertrand,
Natalie, Guillaume and particularly Nadia Sénéchal for taking care of my administrative
procedures with the university and being an active member along my PhD. I also want
to thank the members of my jury (S. Aarninkhof, Y. Balouin, F. Floc’h and P. Catalán)
for taking the time to read and review this thesis, as well as the persons who were
present throughout my PhD in the evaluation committee (D. Sous and R. Almar).

I really enjoyed the opportunity to participate in Anglet 2018 field campaign
(that was a really nice way to start my PhD) and collaborate with researchers from
other institutions such as from the University of Plymouth and Université Pau et Pays
de l’Adour. In this sense, I would like to thank J. McCarroll, T. Scott, A. Barrett and
T. Poate for their valuable help in the field during drifter deployment. I would also
wish to thank R. Holman, T. Liu, P. Dérian and E. Bergsma for their valuable comments
along my PhD through email correspondence.

My sincere gratitude to all the PhD and Postdoc crew for always keeping the
spirit up. Barbara, Cassandra, Mélanie and Quentin you were such a wonderful people!
Thanks Arthur for all your help; I really enjoyed our hilarious conversations... It’s sad
that the research community and the world is not yet prepared to know about our

recently novel discovery "the penis rip" and the potential hazard of its flow (that’s what
she said). Thanks Kévin for all your support, I have no doubt that you have incredible
skills and that you’re an amazing researcher. I really admire your capacity to look
beyond the data and the way you think out of the box, keep up the good work! I also
enjoyed the good pre-covid times and the smooth atmosphere sharing the office with
Elias and hanging around with Paulo and José, Brazilian ambassadors of the good life.

The return to normality after the pandemic allowed me to meet and interact
with marvelous people. Thanks Carla for your patience in encouraging me to speak
French without feeling uncomfortable. Marion, your mere presence always cheered
me up. Junli, so kind and so cute. Olivier, always in good mood and ready for a beer.
Among all the recent people I met in France, I would like to particularly thank Maurizio
and Sophie for their genuine support, friendship and chill vibe... I really wish I had
met you before and I will truly miss you (although I know we will meet again at some
congress to catch up). Hasta plus!

Last but not least, I want to thank my parents Raúl and Yolanda for planting in
me the seed of education, research and self-improvement (una raya más al tigre). I
want also to thank my brother and sister, Josué and Erendira, and all my family back in
Mexico for their endless support. I’m very grateful to Amaia Ruiz De Alegría-Arzaburu
and the MORDICS team who supported me from the beginning and throughout the
PhD. Thanks to my friends Ixetl and Aimie for helping me dealing with all the French
administrative process and encouraging me to come to France. Thanks to Marco,
Jessica and the recent member of the family, Marquito, for joining the experience of
living in France. I wish to express my appreciation to all the crew from CICESE and
UABC-IIO who generate excellent human resources with international competitiveness.

Finally, I would like to thank the University of Bordeaux for hosting me, and I
would especially like to thank the Mexican government and CONACYT for granting
me a scholarship and giving me the opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills to
which I will ultimately contribute to the benefit of my country.

1.1     General context

The nearshore zone, extending from the beach to water depths of the order of 10 to
20 m, is the region of the coast where the forces of the sea react against the land
(Simm et al., 1996). Although the nearshore zone constitutes only 10−3 of the ocean’s
surface area, it is a critical resource for recreation, industry, commerce and defense
(Holman and Haller, 2013). Apart from these societal interests, the nearshore zone
embodies a significant research interest since it is a highly dynamic environment where
processes of circulation and sediment transport occur (Perkovic, 2008). Wave-induced
currents transport and mix sediment, nutrients and pollutants along the surf zone and
the offshore influencing the nearshore morphology at spatiotemporal scales of hours to
decades and meters to tens of kilometers (Aarninkhof, 2003).

   Along open sandy beaches longshore currents are produced under oblique incident
waves (Figure 1.1a) and rip currents and associated circulation cell systems are pro-
duced mostly under near shore-normally incident waves (Figure 1.1b). Rip currents are
narrow and concentrated seaward-directed flows that extend from close to the shore-
line, through the surf zone, and varying distances beyond. Although rip currents and
associated circulations are essentially driven by wave breaking, they are also controlled
by beach morphology and modulated by the tide, thus resulting in a broad family of
rips with different mechanisms and behaviors (Castelle et al., 2016b).

rent under different angles of wave incidence. Figure modified from Winckler (2020).



   The mutual adjustment between hydrodynamic processes and morphology towards
and equilibrium relationship is what is known as morphodynamics (Wright and Thom,
1977). The morphodynamic system within the nearshore can be considered to be com-
posed of two main interdependent components: the dynamics of a wave field over the
shoaling bathymetry of a beach, and the reciprocal response through sediment transport
of the beach bathymetry to that wave field (also influenced by tidal forcing) (Holman
et al., 1993). The ability to capture the spatial and temporal variations in mean flows
in the surf zone is key to predicting the morphological change of the nearshore topog-
raphy and shoreline (Perkovic, 2008). Although the nearshore circulation along open
sandy beaches is relatively well known (Jackson and Short, 2020), the coupled rip cur-
rent morphodynamic system under high-energy wave forcing is still poorly understood
(Castelle et al., 2016b). This is particularly true for geologically-constrained beaches
containing features such as headlands or reefs (Mouragues et al., 2020b).

   An explanation for this lack of quantitative understanding is that most of the studies
in the nearshore zone are based on short-term field measurements, therefore limiting
the range of wave, tide and morphological conditions. In situ instruments are typically
deployed only for a short duration in single sparse points. Although measurements are
very accurate, the deployment of instruments is expensive, time-consuming and logis-
tically complicated, particularly under high-energetic wave-dominated beach environ-
ments. For storm events, breaking waves in the surf zone are violent and wave-driven
currents can be strong, which makes work in the surf zone dangerous to both people
and instruments (Holman and Haller, 2013). Moreover, fixed instruments are difficult
to maintain since they can be buried over surprisingly short periods due to large mor-
phological changes in sandy bottoms.




   The previous limitations led to the concept of using remote sensing techniques
to transform signals from different sensors into geophysical data in order to infer
nearshore hydrodynamic and morphological processes away from the hostile marine
conditions (Holman et al., 1993). Since many nearshore processes have optical sig-
natures, video imaging offers the unique capability to collect high volumes of data at
high temporal and spatial resolution over long periods with relatively low cost (Perugini
et al., 2019). For this reason, shore-based video monitoring has been developed into a
very popular method for sampling indirectly the nearshore environment (Holman and
Stanley, 2007). It has become one of the fastest growing remote sensing techniques in
the past 40 years due to its wider access by the international community. Examples of
research-based video camera systems around the world are Argus (Holman et al., 1993),
Cam-Era (www.niwa.co.nz), EVS (http://www.svm.it), Sirena (Nieto et al., 2010),
COSMOS (Taborda and Silva, 2012), and Kosta (http://www.kostasystem.com). Typi-
cal standard image products derived from video systems are snapshot, 10-min averaged
time-exposure images (timex), 10-min variance images and 10-min timestack images
(pixel transect time series) (see Figure 1.2).

   Oblique images can be transformed to a longshore/cross-shore local ground co-
ordinate system through a standard photogrammetric transformation (Holland et al.,
1997; Hartley and Zisserman, 2004). The mapping conversion (rectification) requires
a camera calibration to correct lens distorsion effects and spatially distributed surveyed
ground control points (GCPs) for georeferencing. When only one camera is used, the
vertical coordinate of the projection is usually assigned to the instant sea level, which
is usually retrieved from a nearby tide gauge or pressure sensor. As shown by the timex
image in Figure 1.3, once the image is rectified, the visible signatures associated with
nearshore morphological features can be analyzed and quantified.

   The development of nearshore video techniques has taken place over many years.
Optical signatures have been exploited to infer hydrodynamic processes such as surface
currents and wave characteristics. For example, wave crests can be tracked to determine
the wave celerity (Stockdon and Holman, 2000; Almar et al., 2009), the foam left by
breaking waves can be used as a tracer to infer underlying currents (Chickadel et al.,
2003; Almar et al., 2016; Dérian and Almar, 2017; Anderson et al., 2021) and the foam
pixel intensity can be used as a proxy for wave dissipation (Aarninkhof and Ruessink,
2004). A summary of the key processes that have been examined by video remote
sensing in the last decades with examples of related publications is shown in Table 1.1.

    Much effort has been dedicated to derive bathymetry maps from video imagery
through the linear dispersion relationship for free surface waves. The cBathy algo-
rithm (Holman et al., 2013) is nowadays the most popular algorithm to obtain two-
dimensional bathymetries from video stations (Simarro et al., 2019). According to
Holman et al. (2013), bathymetry maps are estimated with a typical accuracy of 10s
of centimeters. Nevertheless, these estimates are obtained under quasi-ideal circum-
stances, e.g. micro tidal environment and moderate waves. As mentioned by Bergsma
(2017), although the depth estimation technique is promising, it should be tested under
more energetic wave conditions and larger tidal ranges since the accuracy depends to
a large extent on the wave conditions; depth-inversion errors typically increase with
increasing wave energy.
    On the other hand, there is clear interest in the ability to directly measure currents
and circulation in the nearshore (for example, for estimating longshore sediment trans-
port and rip currents). It is important to note that prior to this manuscript (before
2018), existing works in the literature to determine two-dimensional surface currents
from video imagery relied primarily on cross-correlation techniques, in particular using

                                                                        6


                                                     1.2. OBJECTIVES AND APPROACH


particle image velocimetry (PIV; Adrian 1991; Holland et al. 2001). Within the surf
zone, only a few studies were devoted to estimating surface currents (Chickadel et al.,
2003; Almar et al., 2016), but only addressing the velocity component along a given
transect. The work presented by Dérian and Almar (2017) shows the first attempt to
optically derive two-dimensional surface currents using a technique common in the re-
search field of computer vision based on optical flow. Part of the manuscript is inspired
by the method proposed by Dérian and Almar (2017) which leads to the motivation
to improve and fill the preceding knowledge gap of their work as it was designed to
address surface flow in the swash.

   Overall, the development and application of new concepts in video remote sens-
ing techniques opens new perspective to monitor both surface currents (e.g., Dérian
and Almar, 2017; Anderson et al., 2021) and the underlying bathymetry (e.g., Holman
et al., 2013) on a high spatio-temporal scale, thus providing new insights into nearshore
hydro- and morphodynamics processes.




1.2     Objectives and approach


The main aim of this work is to implement and develop optical remote sensing tech-
niques to study nearshore morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes under high-
energetic wave conditions in a meso-macro tidal environment. For that purpose, Hol-
man et al. (2013) cBathy algorithm and Liu (2017) optical flow algorithm are adapted
in order to get nearshore bathymetry estimations as well as surf-zone surface veloci-
ties fields from high-sampled image sequences. An implicit objective is to seek image
processing solutions that provide the highest accuracy in the final image product (e.g.,
image stabilization methods). These technical advances are then, as a preliminary study,
used to address for the first time the temporal and spatial variability of nearshore circu-
lation at a beach in southwest France under high-energy wave forcing.

1.3     Thesis outline

This manuscript is divided into six chapters and one appendix. Each chapter contains
its own state of art for easier reading. The thesis is structured as follows:

•     Chapter 2: Field site and data. We present the field site of La Petite Chambre
      d’Amour (PCA) beach, located in one of Anglet beaches (SW France) and describe
      the 3-week comprehensive field experiment carried out in October 2018.

•     Chapter 3: Image stabilization. We investigate the impact of camera viewing
      angle deviation when monitoring the nearshore and present an efficient semi-
      automatic procedure to stabilize an image sequence using state-of-the-art tech-
      niques in order to remove unwanted camera movement after video acquisition.

•     Chapter 4: Nearshore bathymetric mapping from video imagery. We apply a
      video-based linear depth inversion algorithm for three consecutive weeks (during
      daylight hours) to examine PCA beach morphological response under a wide range
      of wave and tide conditions.

•     Chapter 5: Optically derived wave-filtered surface currents. We explore the po-
      tential to derive 2-D wave-filtered surface currents from video images by tracking
      the drifting foam, left after the passage of breaking waves, using an open-source
      optical flow algorithm.

•     Chapter 6: Conclusions and perspectives. We summarize the concluding re-
      marks and place the results in perspective for future investigation.

        glet Beach

The study site throughout this work is the beach of Anglet located on the Basque Coast
in southwestern France (Figure 2.1). Anglet beach is a 4-km long sandy embayment
delimited by a prominent 500-m long rocky headland (Cape Saint-Martin) in the South
and by the southern Adour river training wall in the North. It is a major national
and international tourism destination and a worldwide famous recognized surfing spot

(Benedet et al., 2007) that has been facing serious erosion issues over the last decades
(Birrien et al., 2013). This has resulted in a number of coastal engineering works based
on the implementation of coastal hard structures and beach nourishments to constrain
shoreline variability. Anglet beach is structurally-engineered with 6 groins and 3 distinct
sectors where the beach is backed by a seawall.

   This study is primarily focused on the 3-week field experiment (October 2018) car-
ried out in one of Anglet beaches, La Petite Chambre d’Amour (PCA) beach, located at
the southern end of Anglet beach (Figure 2.7). PCA beach is bounded by the Saint-
Martin rocky headland in the South and a 90-m long groin in the North. It is character-
ized by the presence of an approximately 20-m wide complex natural submerged rocky
reef which exerts persistent wave breaking and occasionally bathymetrically-controlled
rips at low tide under low-energy waves (Mouragues et al., 2020b).
   The following subsections provide an overall description of the field site environ-
mental conditions. The reader is also referred to subsections 3.3.3 and 5.3.4 for a
summarized description of the field site and data used within the published research
articles in the Journal of Remote Sensing.

2.1.1     Tide and wave forcing

There is no tide gauge at Anglet beach. The nearest tide gauges are the Bayonne-Boucau
tide gauge, located within the mouth of the Adour river at 4 km north of PCA beach, and
the Saint-Jean-De-Luz Socoa tide gauge, located 15 km southwest of the study site (see
Figure 2.1). In this study, hourly water level measurements were retrieved from Saint-
Jean-De-Luz Socoa tide gauge from SHOM website (https://data.shom.fr). Data
from the Saint-Jean-De-Luz Socoa tide gauge were preferred to those from the Bayonne-
Boucau tide gauge to avoid the influence of the Adour river discharge on the water level
measurements. Figure 2.2 shows Saint-Jean-De-Luz reconstructed astronomical tide
from 2010 to 2020 along with the tidal parameters indicating different mean water level
positions with respect to the mean sea level (MSL). The tide is semi-diurnal (average
period of 12 h 20 min) and is characterized by a meso-macro tidal regime with an
average tidal range varying between 1.69 m (for neap tides) and 3.94 m (for spring
tides).

   In situ wave measurements were retrieved from a permanent directional wave buoy,
CANDHIS (Centre d’Archivage National de Données de Houle In Situ; http://candhis.
cetmef.developpement-durable.gouv.fr), located approximately 6 km offshore from
the study site and moored in 50-m water depth (Figure 2.1). Wave parameters such as
the significant wave height Hs , peak period Tp and the peak wave angle of incidence
θp were collected every 30 min by the Candhis buoy from January 2013 to September

2018. In addition, hourly wave parameters were retrieved from HOMERE database
(http://marc.ifremer.fr/produits/rejeu_d_etats_de_mer_homere) in order to fill
the gaps present in Candhis time series (Figure 2.3a,b).       The HOMERE database
(Boudière et al., 2013; Accensi and Maisondieu, 2015) is a hindcast of oceanographical
parameters covering the period 1994–2017. Outcomes are produced by WAVEWATCH
III model (Tolman, 1991) over a high-resolution grid comprising the Channel - Bay of
Biscay area. HOMERE wave data was extracted from the grid point located 300 meters
away from the Candhis wave buoy position (see Figure 2.1). Following Castelle et al.
(2014b), HOMERE significant wave height HsHOMERE was corrected via a linear regression
using Candhis buoy data HsHOM ERE , as shown in Figure 2.3c and 2.4a.

   Anglet beach is predominantly exposed to incident shore-normal high-energetic At-
lantic swells coming from the WNW direction (θ¯p ≈ 300°; Figure 2.4b) generated by
extra-tropical low-pressure systems tracking eastwards (Castelle et al., 2017b). The
coast also experiences more variable locally generated wind waves (Abadie et al., 2005).

The incident wave energy is strongly seasonally modulated, with an annual mean signif-
icant wave height and peak period of Hs = 1.57 m and Tp = 10 s, respectively. The wave
data present numerous storm events, including the outstanding winter of 2013/2014
(Castelle et al., 2015; Masselink et al., 2016), which resulted in waves up to 10 m height
causing serious beach erosion and sea defense damage (Figure 2.5). Tide-induced cur-
rents are weak along the Anglet shore and breaking waves are by far the dominant
driver of nearshore currents, with tide elevation affecting breaking patterns and in turn
modulating nearshore currents (Sous et al., 2020).

2.1.2    Morphology

According to Wright and Short (1984) classification, Anglet is a high energy intermedi-
ate beach with the presence of a seasonally modulated double-bar (occasionally single-
bar) system (Huguet et al., 2016). Anglet beach is characterized by a non-dimensional
embayment scaling parameter (Castelle and Coco, 2012) δ ≈ 40 and is therefore char-
acterized by a normal beach circulation (Short and Masselink, 1999), meaning that
Anglet beach tends to behave as an open coast, except close to the headland where PCA
beach is located (Birrien et al., 2013). The beach is composed of medium to coarse
sand (D50 ≈ 2 mm) with a steep beach face (tan β ≈ 1/10) and a more gentle sloped
surf zone (tan β ≈ 1/50) (Mouragues et al., 2020b). The relatively steep beach face

favors the formation of beach cusps with shoreline dynamics strongly controlled by the
geometry of the surf-zone sandbar (Birrien et al., 2013).

   Unlike the open sandy beaches along the northern Aquitaine coast, the Basque coast-
line is characterized by ubiquitous headlands exposing rocky substratum and coastal
structures such as groins and training walls (Huguet et al., 2016). PCA beach in particu-
lar is barred with prominent inherited geology, characterized by the presence of a 500-m
headland, bordered by rocks that emerge around low tide, and a natural submerged reef
located approximately 150 m from the headland (Figure 2.7). These two morphological
characteristics play an important role on beach circulation inducing headland rips and
bathymetrically controlled rips with a potential competition/combination between one
another that can favor sediment transport and headland bypassing (McCarroll et al.,
2018; Mouragues et al., 2020b).




2.1.3    Biarritz lighthouse video monitoring system


In January 2013, a permanent video system composed of three cameras was installed
on the top of Biarritz lighthouse (70 m above mean sea level) located near the tip
of Saint-Martin headland (Figure 2.6). The combined video cameras monitor about
2 km of the southern beach that includes PCA beach and four groins. Each camera
provides different image products in the daylight. From September 2013 to February
2017, single snapshot images, 10-min averaged time-exposure images (timex), 10-min
variance images and 10-min timestack images (e.g., Figure 1.2) were collected every
20 min at 1 Hz. In March 2017, the configuration changed. From April 2017 to the
present, images products were collected every 15 min at 1 Hz during an average period
of sampling of 14 min. Moreover, since 2017, an additional single video camera was
installed at the same location. This camera can, on demand, acquire continuously high-
frequency (1 Hz) video images during particular events such as the field campaign of
October 2018. However, the video-monitoring area of this camera comprises only PCA
beach (Figure 2.6 and 2.7).

2.2     October 2018 field experiment

An intensive field campaign was conducted at PCA beach from 3 to 26 October 2018
under a range of energetic wave conditions including a spring tide cycle (Figure 2.8).
The 3-week field experiment was carried out in the frame of the MEPELS project, per-
formed under the auspices of the DGA and led by SHOM. The experiment involved the
collaboration of teams from three different laboratories (EPOC-University of Bordeaux,
Coastal Marine Applied Research CMAR-University of Plymouth and SIAME-University
of Pau and Pays de l’Adour) that coordinated the deployment and data collection of
a large array of instruments including: four current profilers, six surf-zone drifters,
topo-bathymetric surveys, image acquisition from a fixed video-camera and a camera-
equipped Unmmaned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), as well as continuous tide, wave and wind
data collection from nearby in situ stations (Figure 2.1 and 2.7). The following sub-
sections describe the instruments and data collected during the three-week field exper-
iment. The works of Mouragues et al. (2020a,b) provide a detailed analysis of PCA
beach wave-induced circulation during October 2018 field campaign.

2.2.1    Topography and bathymetry data

An initial multi-beam bathymetric survey was conducted on 26 June 2018 to map
the submerged reef and surrounding rocks of the headland. Two additional mono-
beam bathymetric surveys with cross-shore transects spaced 50 m apart were carried
out to capture the sandy beach morphology at the beginning (5/Oct/2018) and end
(26/Oct/2018) of the field experiment. All bathymetries were obtained through Real

Time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (RTK-GNSS) surveyed from a boat.
The upper and intertidal beach topography were surveyed using a Post Processing Kine-
matic Differential Global Navigation Satellite System (PPK-GNSS) carried in by walk on
15 and 22 October 2018. In addition, a high-resolution topographic survey employing
photogrammetry (Laporte-Fauret et al., 2019) obtained by an UAV was performed at
spring low tide on 24 October 2018 to measure the headland topography as well as
the upper shore-face topography. The vertical uncertainty (95% CI) from bathymet-
ric and topographic surveys is estimated to be less than 0.20 and 0.07 m, respectively
(Mouragues et al., 2020b). These numerous surveys were combined and gridded us-
ing a natural neighbor interpolation approach that took cross-shore transect anisotropy
into account. Figure 2.7 shows a comprehensive bathy-topo map relative to NGF-IGN69
leveling resulted from combination of bathymetric (26 June and 5 October 2018), to-
pographic (15 October 2018) and UAV-derived topographic surveys. The submerged
reef’s maximum elevation is around -2.9 m (NGF-IGN69), corresponding to -2.5 m rela-
tive to the mean sea level. Figure 2.7b,e depicts the reef’s significant influence on wave
breaking patterns. It is worth noting that the connection between the beach and the
headland is rather curved (see Figure 2.7a,d,e).

2.2.2.1   ADCP data

Four Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) were installed at different locations
across the field site to continuously measure and store pressure and velocity data along
the water column in order to assess the natural variability of bathymetrically controlled
circulation and headland rips. As described in Mouragues et al. (2020b), SIG1 (Nortek
Signature 500 kHz; 4 Hz; cell size: 0.5 m), SIG2 (Nortek Signature 1000 kHz; 8 Hz;
cell size 0.2 m), SIG3 (Nortek Signature 1000 kHz; 1 Hz; cell size: 0.2 m) and AQ
(Nortek Aquadopp; 2 MHz; 1 Hz; cell size 0.1 m) were deployed far offshore (800 m
offshore), few meters off the reef, along the headland and in the vicinity of the reef,
respectively (see Figure 2.7). For convenience, velocities components were transformed
to a cross-shore/alongshore local coordinate system by rotating 60° (counter-clockwise

   It is worth to note that only the Aquadopp current profiler (Figure 2.10a) is consid-
ered throughout this study since it is the only ADCP deployed within the fixed-camera
view field that can be used to validate the video remote sensing techniques (see Figure

2.2.2.2   Drifter data

The drifter experiment was supported by the very experienced team of CMAR (Coastal
Marine Applied Research, coastal consultancy at University of Plymouth) who provided
six surf-zone drifters and help in the field during drifter deployment. The drifters were
released multiple times near the reef to measure Lagrangian surface current velocities
and capture a wider spatial extent of circulation variability than Eulerian measurements.
Deployment methods varied from surfzone seeding by hand (swimming the drifter into

position) and drifter seeding by jet ski. Drifters were based on the design of MacMa-
han et al. (2009) and consisted of a 110-cm long thin PVC pole with a GNSS antenna
attached on top (Figure 2.10b). To minimize surfing behavior, the mast was coupled
to a 40-cm long submerged PVC tube that served as ballast, with a dampening plate
and exterior fins. This type of drifter design has been previously used to measure sur-
face flows associated with rips (e.g., Austin et al. 2013; McCarroll et al. 2014; Scott
et al. 2016). The drifter positions were telemetered in real time to a coastal ground sta-
tion to facilitate deployment and retrieving logistics. QPS Qinsy hydrographic software
was used to track drifter positions. Drifters’ data collected at 2.5 Hz allowed studying
surface current circulation patterns over the course of four days (18, 19, 22, and 23
October 2018). Individual deployment duration for each day ranged from 2 h to 3 h 30
min with spatial coverage ranging from 330 to 950 m relative to the shoreline position.
According to Mouragues et al. (2020b), drifter position and velocity uncertainties are
estimated to be less than 3 m and approximately 0.1 m/s, respectively. Furthermore,
the error associated to the effect of wind slippage on drifter trajectory is below 0.04
m/s.

2.2.3    Video data

As shown in subsection 2.1.3 (Figure 2.6), high-frequency (1 Hz) sampled images
recorded at 1624x1234 px were collected continuously during daylight hours for al-
most the entire three-week field experiment from a single video camera located inside
Biarritz lighthouse (see Figure 2.8d; H-b Cam). Additional video monitoring was made
using a camera-equipped UAV (e.g., Figure 2.7c).


2.2.4    Offshore wave, tide and wind conditions

During the field experiment, PCA beach was exposed to incident wave conditions char-
acterized by long-period moderate- to high-energy wave events. Offshore significant
wave height Hs ranged from 0.4 to 4.2 m, with a mean of 1.5 m (Figure 2.8a), while
offshore peak wave period Tp and mean wave period Tm02 ranged from 6 to 16 s and
from 5 to 11 s, respectively (Figure 2.8b).
   Wave conditions were also characterized by a wide range of wave incident obliquity,
from shore-normal to very oblique waves (Figure 2.8c). The peak wave incidence (angle
of wave incidence relative to the shore normal) θp ranged from -23 to 27°. The sign of
θp is set depending on which side of the headland waves are coming from (Figure 2.8a).
While θp = 0° indicates shore-normal waves (hereafter called shore-normal configura-
tion), θp < 0° and θp > 0° mean that the headland is located at the updrift (hereafter
called shadowed configuration) or downdrift (hereafter called deflection configuration)
side of the embayment, respectively. Overall, the first and third weeks of measurements
correspond to deflection configuration, while the second week was mostly shadowed
configuration.
   Hourly wind data was retrieved from the Biarritz airport meteorological station (71
m altitude) located approximately 3 km SW of the study site (Figure 2.1). wind condi-
tions were relatively weak during the field experiment, with mean wind speed around
3 m/s coming primarily from the S-SE sector, reaching wind speed up to 12 m/s com-
ing from the W-NW (roughly shore normal) direction. In addition to the offshore wave
condition variability, the experiment was characterized by different tidal level with tidal
range varying from 4.4 m during spring tides to 1.1 m during neap tides (Figure 2.8a).

This chapter is based on the research article Rodriguez-Padilla et al. (2020) published in

which is concerned to unwanted camera movement. In the case of this study, during the
early stage of image processing we realized that the images did not remain static over
time, implying camera movement. Preliminary results obtained using this set of shifted
images showed large errors associated to even slightly camera viewing angle deviation
resulting in questionable and unreliable video-derived products. It is important to note
that camera movement was sort of unexpected since the fixed-mounted cameras were
located inside the lighthouse sheltered from the external elements (e.g., wind or rain)
which would lead to the assumption that there should not be any factor that could al-
ter its position. Nevertheless, thermal expansion was the responsible for this particular
type of camera motion which evidently was an issue difficult to avoid or prevent. An
alarming founding was that image-shifting was present and spread on a wide range of
timescales over the total 5-year long image time series representing a major source of
error for further video analysis. Thus, it was imperative to devote some time to inves-
tigate the impact of camera viewing angle deviation and find an approach to reorient
(i.e., stabilize) each of the shifted images in order to guarantee an optimal accuracy.

   This chapter summarizes an approach to correct/stabilize a low-sampled (daily) im-
age sequence, as there was no straightforward image stabilization method available that
worked under large variations of brightness between frames. The developed approach
consists of quantifying the displacement in the image plane (induced by camera move-
ment) by tracking fixed recognizable feature points and further using them to warp the
image with respect to a reference position. What makes this method really unique from

other existing stabilization methods is the implementation of a Canny filter (Canny,
1986) which adds robustness to track features under varying brightness and contrast
conditions making it suitable for large databases processing. This method is generic
(pending fixed salient points) and has also been tested using UAV imagery proving to
be useful against undesirable flight movements such as repositioning or high-frequency
vibrations. Therefore, the present stabilization method opens new perspectives to rou-
tinely improve camera geometry of video monitoring systems to further derive higher
quality remotely sensed hydrodynamic and morphological products.




3.2       Introduction

The use of shore-based video systems has become a very popular and accessible low-
cost tool for coastal monitoring given their capability to deliver continuous and high-
resolution temporal data over large enough spatial scales. However, the reliability of
the final image products can be compromised by external factors, sometimes over-
looked, that can alter the image geometry over time. In particular, unwanted cam-
era movement, produced either by thermal or mechanical effects, can lead to signifi-
cant geo-rectification errors if not properly corrected. Several studies (Bouvier et al.,
2019; Holman and Stanley, 2007; Pearre and Puleo, 2009; Vousdoukas et al., 2011a,b)
have acknowledged the presence of camera motion and have proposed different post-
processing procedures, often referred to as image stabilization methods, to compensate
for camera movement. This chapter addresses an alternative straightforward method to
stabilize an either continuous or subsampled image sequence based on state-of-the-art
techniques and available routines. This method can also be applied to remove high-
frequency camera movements obtained when using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
for monitoring purpose. Image stabilization is a fundamental post-processing step that
should always be performed in general coastal imaging applications to increase the
accuracy of video-derived products, such as shoreline/sandbar position and depths es-
timate.

3.3     Article: A Simple and Efficient Image Stabilization
        Method for Coastal Video Monitoring Video Systems

3.3.1    Abstract

Fixed video camera systems are consistently prone to importune motions over time due
to either thermal effects or mechanical factors. These, even subtle, displacements are
mostly overlooked or ignored, although they can lead to large geo-rectification errors.
This paper describes a simple and efficient method to stabilize an either continuous or
sub-sampled image sequence based on feature-matching and sub-pixel cross-correlation
techniques. The method requires the presence and identification of different land-sub-
image regions containing static recognizable features referred to as keypoints, such as
corners or salient points. A Canny edge detector (CED) is used to locate and extract
the boundaries of the features. Keypoints are matched against themselves after com-
puting their two-dimensional displacement with respect to a reference frame. Pairs of
keypoints are subsequently used as control points to fit a geometric transformation in
order to align the whole frame with the reference image. The stabilization method is
applied to 5 years of daily images collected from a three-camera permanent video sys-
tem located at Anglet Beach, southwest France. Azimuth, tilt and roll deviations are
computed for each camera. The three cameras showed motions on a wide range of time
scales, with a prominent annual signal in azimuth and tilt deviation. Camera move-
ment amplitude reached up to 10 pixels in azimuth, 30 pixels in tilt and 0.4° in roll,
together with a quasi-steady counter-clockwise trend over the 5-year time series. More-
over, camera viewing angle deviations were found to induce large rectification errors of
up to 400 m at a distance of 2.5 km from the camera. The mean shoreline apparent
position was also affected by an approximately 10-20 m bias during the 2013/2014 out-
standing winter period. The stabilization semi-automatic method successfully corrects
camera geometry for fixed video monitoring systems and is able to process at least 90%
of the frames without user assistance. The use of the CED greatly improves the perfor-
mance of the cross-correlation algorithm by making it more robust against contrast and
brightness variations between frames. The method appears as a promising tool for other

3.3.2    Introduction

Over the past decades, the use of shore-based video systems has become a very popular
and accessible low-cost tool for coastal monitoring given their capability to deliver con-
tinuous, high-frequency (e.g., daily) data over large enough spatial scales (Holman and
Stanley, 2007; Splinter et al., 2018b). Among the many applications using video-based
remote sensing are shoreline and sandbar position tracking (van Enckevort et al., 2004;
Coco et al., 2005; Huguet et al., 2016), nearshore bathymetry estimation (Stockdon
and Holman, 2000; van Dongeren et al., 2008; Holman et al., 2013), determination
of intertidal beach slope (Aarninkhof and Roelvink, 1999; Madsen and Plant, 2001),
rip channel formation and evolution, (Bogle et al., 2001; Holman et al., 2006; Turner
et al., 2007; Quartel, 2009), estimation of longshore currents (Chickadel et al., 2003;
Almar et al., 2016), wave celerity, period and direction (Lippmann and Holman, 1991;
Holland and Holman, 1999; Stockdon and Holman, 2000), as well as breaking wave
height (Almar et al., 2012a).
   Nevertheless, successful and reliable video-based products can only be produced
if accurate image transformation into real-world coordinates is achieved. This is per-
formed through photogrammetry techniques which provides relationship between the
2-D image geometry and the 3-D real-world coordinates. A common approach con-
sists in using projective transformation (Holland et al., 1997; Hartley and Zisserman,
2004) that usually takes into account two types of calibration: an intrinsic calibration,
which accounts for the physical characteristics of the camera lens and can be obtained
directly in the lab prior to field installation (in order to remove distortion effects); and
an extrinsic calibration, which depends on the camera location and orientation after
installation, as well as a set of surveyed ground control points (GCPs), correspondingly
manually digitized from the image. Both calibrations are often done just once assuming
that the physical properties of the lens remain unchanged over time and that the video
cameras and their mounting structure do not move. Hence, the real-world coordinates
of the fixed GCPs are supposed to systematically coincide with the digitized GCPs image

coordinates for all video frames. However, the latter assumption is challenged by many
observations showing that even fixed-mounted video cameras are never perfectly static
(Holman and Stanley, 2007; Pearre and Puleo, 2009; Vousdoukas et al., 2011b; Bouvier
et al., 2019).

   Common non-anthropogenic causes that may produce camera movement or vibra-
tion are attributed to thermal expansion and insulation effects as well as rain and wind
forcing (Holman and Stanley, 2007; Bouvier et al., 2019). This is particularly evident in
outdoor installations where cameras are directly exposed to the elements. One possible
but tedious solution to address this issue is to digitize all the GCPs for each presum-
ably displaced image in order to obtain separately geometric solutions (Bouvier et al.,
2019). Another potentially more efficient alternative is to use (semi-)automatic image
stabilization.

   Image stabilization refers to any technique used to create a video sequence in which
any unwanted camera motion is removed from the original sequence. In coastal im-
agery, Holman and Stanley (2007) were the first to address the problem of camera
viewing angle variations due to thermal and wind effects. In order to compensate
the camera movement after acquisition, they used a template matching method that
consisted in selecting small high-contrast regions of an image (including fixed objects
and salient points) and match them with a reference image (from a survey date with
a known geometry solution) to compute their displacement (deviations of tilt and az-
imuth) in terms of pixel shift. Using this technique they found an almost daily diurnal
signal with an amplitude of approximately 2 pixels in tilt as a result of thermal response
of the tower on which the cameras were mounted. After geo-rectification, this shift was
equivalent to an error of approximately 30 m in the longshore direction 1000 m away
from the camera. With the further increased use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
such method has been refined and automatized to create and recognize features (virtual
GCP’s) within a user specified window and a brightness intensity threshold (Holman
et al., 2017; Bergsma et al., 2019).

   Similar automated feature matching image stabilization methods have been devel-
oped using the same principle of image comparison. Pearre and Puleo (2009) used
correlation techniques, a procedure similar to particle image velocimetry (PIV; (Adrian,

1991)) to correct camera azimuthal and tilt movement. They showed that geo-rectified
image errors owing to camera movement grows nonlinearly with the distance between
the camera and the object of interest. Therefore, even small pixel variations can lead to
large errors in real-world coordinates (500 m error 2300 m away from the camera at Re-
hoboth Beach, Delaware; (Pearre and Puleo, 2009)). Moreover, they found that despite
all the cameras experienced slight movements, the motion effect after geo-rectification
was more evident on the camera with the longest focal length as this camera was more
sensitive to small changes in tilt. Another semi-automatic image stabilization proce-
dure is described by Vousdoukas et al. (2011a,b) for UAVs and fixed cameras. Their
method consists first in defining a mask to remove the sea from the land for all frames.
The next step is to extract and match pairs of features (keypoints) between consecu-
tive frames. This can be done either using a Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT;
(Lowe, 1999, 2004)) or a Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm (Bay et al.,
2008). Both algorithms are capable to detect and extract distinctive features such as
corners and salient points, under some variations of illumination, scale, and orientation
between frames. In order to identify the correct matches, a random sample consensus
(RANSAC) algorithm (Fischler and Bolles, 1981) is implemented to filter the outliers,
followed by a least squares fit approach, as well as a sub-sampling of keypoints pairs to
reduce computation time.

   All the above techniques rely upon the presence of land-based features or any fixed
region that includes objects with high contrast in the camera field of view. However, in
some cases, cameras just look at the ocean covering only a small beach portion offering
little of no fixed salient features. Some studies have overcome this limitation by track-
ing the horizon and using it as a geometric constraint in order to estimate the camera
position and stabilize the images (Schwendeman and Thomson, 2015; Sánchez-García
et al., 2017). On the other hand, anticipating or predicting the movement of a camera
can also be considered as an alternative approximation to reduce image deviation af-
ter acquisition when no features are available in the camera view field. Bouvier et al.
(2019) identified the primary environmental parameters controlling cameras shift (air
temperature, wind conditions, nebulosity and solar position) and used them to develop

ment against the observed camera viewing angles deviations (r2 = 0.71, RM SE =
0.12° for tilt and roll anomaly) confirming that, at their site, camera motion is primarily
controlled by thermal expansion of the pole where the cameras were mounted, which
is modulated in magnitude by the solar azimuth angle and cloud coverage. Bouvier
et al. (2019) indicated that the rectification error is up to 200 m and 20 m in the long-
shore and cross-shore direction, respectively, which can be decreased by 80% with their
automated stabilization method.
   Image stabilization is a fundamental topic in the research field of Computer Vision
(Szeliski, 2010) with many applications in object recognition (Torii et al., 2011), motion
analysis (Rawat and Singhai, 2011), image restoration (Wang and Tao, 2016), among
others (Chalom et al., 2013). Similar stabilization methods have been developed with
other purposes outside the field of coastal imagery (Hsieh and Kao, 2010; Chang Li
and Yangke Liu, 2011; Kulkarni et al., 2017; Souza and Pedrini, 2018). One primary
problem with existing stabilization methods is that they are sensitive to changes in illu-
mination making them prone to failure (El-gayar et al., 2013). Brightness and contrast
variations due to illumination changes are typical for image sequences and can often
change within a few frames (Matas et al., 2003). Moreover, if the image sequence is
sub-sampled, these parameters can substantially change between consecutive frames.
The purpose of the present work is to develop a new straightforward method for im-
age stabilization to overcome this limitation. This method provides a robust solution to
stabilize an image sequence under varying illumination with the ability to process large
databases. It builds on state-of-the-art techniques and available routines, with valuable
input for the coastal imaging research community. The following sections will describe
the basic steps to stabilize an image sequence compensating for camera motion to avoid
positioning errors in the image. Furthermore, the image stabilization method will be
applied to 5 years of continuous video data collected from a three-camera video system
located at Anglet Beach, southwest France.

Coast in southwest France (Figure 3.1). The beach is delimited by a prominent head-

land in the South and extends over 4 km up to a 1 km long jetty protecting the entrance
of the river mouth. According to Wright and Short (1984) classification, Anglet Beach
is an intermediate-reflective beach composed of medium to coarse sand with a steep
beach-face slope (tan β ≈ 0.1) characterized by a mostly double bar system (Birrien
et al., 2013; Huguet et al., 2016). Given the WNW beach orientation, the coast is
predominantly exposed to North Atlantic high-energy swells coming from the WNW
direction with an average annual significant offshore wave height Hs = 1.57 m (occa-
sional wave heights > 10 m during winter storms) and average peak period Tp = 10
s (Enjalbert et al., 2011; Birrien et al., 2013). Tides in the area are semi-diurnal with
average ranges of 3.94 m for spring tides and 1.69 m for neap tides (i.e., meso-macro
tidal range).

   A permanent video-monitoring station has been operating since September 2013 at
the southern end of Anglet Beach. It is installed inside the Biarritz lighthouse, 70 m
above mean sea level. The station consists of three cameras: camera 1 (12 mm lens),
camera 2 (25 mm lens) and camera 3 (8 mm lens) that together cover approximately
2.5 km of the southern beach shoreline, including 4 groins that extend about 100 m
seaward (Figure 3.1). Each camera provides different image products during daylight.

From September 2013 to February 2017, single snapshot images, 10-min averaged time-
exposure images (timex), 10-min variance images and 10-min timestack images (e.g.,
Holman and Stanley, 2007) were collected every 20 min at 1 Hz. In March 2017, the
configuration of the video-station changed. Since April 2017 to the present, image prod-
ucts are collected every 15 min at 1 Hz during an averaged period of sampling of 14-
min. According to Castelle et al. (2014b), the best shoreline proxy for meso-macrotidal
multiple-barred beaches is obtained at mean high water level (MHW), since the inner-
bar and berm dynamics have little influence on the shoreline cross-shore displacement
for this elevation contour. In order to have at least one image per day, the lowest high
tide level was preferred. For this study, time-exposure images were selected at mean
high water neap level time (MHWN = 0.86 m) with a mean accuracy of ± 0.08 m and
a maximum error of ± 0.28 m. This resulted in a 5-year daily time-exposure image
time series consisting of approximately 1500 frames per camera spanning from October
1, 2013 to September 9, 2018. The timex time series will be treated as a continuous
image sequence and will be further used to compute the long-term image displacement
for each camera.




3.3.4    Image stabilization method


The image stabilization method developed below is based on feature matching and
necessarily requires the presence of at least a few recognizable static features distributed
in both dimensions in the field of view. Features should not be collinear so that the
geometric transformation can be correctly applied to the whole image. The concept
of the method is to compute the two-dimensional displacement (azimuth and tilt) of
the features between frames and use them as matching control points to estimate a 2-
D geometric transformation that incorporates translation, rotation and scaling to align
the whole image with a reference image. The following subsections will describe the
basic steps to stabilize an image sequence through a semi-automatic procedure using
state-of-the-art techniques.

3.3.4.1   Reference image and sub-image regions selection

The first step consists of defining a reference image. All the frame motions will be
estimated relative to this reference image. The selection of the reference image should
correspond to the time when the GCPs were surveyed. The next step is to identify static
recognizable features within the reference frame. The features should be easily visible
fixed objects such as buildings or any inland hard structure containing corners or salient
points. The features should not only appear in the reference image, but also in every
frame of the whole time series. Around each feature, a sub-image region (hereinafter
referred to as zone) should be manually defined. This user-defined zone surrounding
the feature must also contain a single reference point, referred to as keypoint, specified
by the user. Every zone will act as a search region to identify the keypoint, representing
the feature, that will be drifting with time. This implies that the user needs to estimate
a possible range of camera pixel shift to design the zone within which the feature and
keypoint is always visible. This can be done easily through a visual inspection of the
entire image sequence. To test if the zone size is adequate, the zone from the reference
frame can be compared with the last frame of the image sequence (assuming that the
last frame is shifted) or any other random frame to verify if the zone still isolates the
feature containing the keypoint. It must also bear in mind that the user must design a
not too large zone to keep computation time reasonable since every zone is treated as
an individual sub-image sequence. The number of keypoints depends on the geometric
transformation that will further be used (at least two keypoints are necessary; more is
better) and should be distributed as much as possible throughout the reference image
to avoid collinearity. The keypoint pixel positions will be defined as (κz,c  z,c
                                                                         u , κv ), where z

is the sub-image zone index and c is the camera number index.
   Figure 3.2 shows an example of the selection of four different sub-image zones for
camera 2 of Anglet video station. The sizes of the zones vary but are kept to roughly
250×90 pixels. It is worth to mention that it is not advised to choose groins as keypoints
since the corresponding zone will include non-stationary features from the water (such
as foam patches) that can be mistakenly identified as keypoints and can introduce sig-
nificant errors during the image stabilization method (Vousdoukas et al., 2011a). For
the present study four zones were defined for camera 1 and 2, and five zones for camera

3.3.4.2   Canny edge detector

Many popular algorithms automatically recognize, extract and match keypoints be-
tween frames without any a priori knowledge using corner and blob recognition un-
der similar illumination conditions (Tareen and Saleem, 2018). Examples of widely
used feature detection algorithms are: SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform; (Lowe,
1999, 2004)), FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test; (Rosten and Drummond,
2005)) and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features; (Bay et al., 2008)). Although these
algorithms have proven to be very efficient in object recognition applications, their per-
formance is only robust against small brightness changes between frames. This does
not represent an inconvenience if the image sequence to stabilize is sampled at a high-
frequency frame rate during a small period of time (e.g., UAV survey at 2 Hz during 17
min) since the contrast and brightness between frames barely change. However, in long-
term coastal monitoring, it is common to work with sub-sampled image sequences (e.g.,

daily images as for this study) where consecutive frames usually change substantially
in terms of brightness and contrast owing to different weather and daylight conditions
leading the feature detector algorithms to degrade and fail.
   The present stabilization method makes use of a Canny edge detector (CED;
(Canny, 1986)) to enhance and extract the edges that define the boundaries of the pri-
mary features within a sub-image zone. Although the CED is not insensitive to changes
in illumination, it is quite robust at recognizing the same edges between frames even
under luminosity variations. The CED works in 5 steps: a) smooth the image using
a Gaussian filter in order to remove the noise; b) determine the image intensity gra-
dient in both vertical and horizontal directions; c) apply a non-maximum suppression
to discard all the points that do not occur at the gradient local maximum; d) apply
double threshold to preserve certain edges and e) track and keep weak edges that are
connected to strong edges via an edge threshold (referred to as hysteresis).


3.3.4.3   Image sub-pixel cross-correlation and translation

Before registering and aligning images, a mathematical relationship should be estab-
lished so that pixel coordinates can be mapped from one image to another. In this
sense, a displaced image g(u0 , v 0 ) can be expressed as a coordinate transformation (T )
of a reference image f (u, v). A 2-D affine transformation that considers only transla-
tion is valid to apply if the size, shape and orientation of the displaced image remain
the same as that of the reference image. This mapping can be represented as a ma-
trix multiplication (g = Tf ) using homogeneous coordinates (Hartley and Zisserman,
2004):

discrete Fourier transform algorithm). This algorithm allows registering the image
displacement within a user-specified fraction of a pixel. The algorithm starts by up-
sampling two times the resolution of the image dimensions (M and N ) and applying
a discrete fast Fourier transform (DFT) over all image points (u, v) to get an initial es-
timate of the location of the cross-correlation peak. The cross-correlation (CCf g ) of

   For a higher up-sampling factor, instead of computing all the up-sampled points of
the array, only a small neighborhood around the initial peak estimate is up-sampled
using a matrix-multiply discrete Fourier transform to refine the peak location. This
dramatically reduces computation cost without losing accuracy. A detailed description
of the algorithm is beyond the scope of the present contribution and can be found
in (Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2007, 2008a). In addition, a MATLAB code version of the
algorithm is freely available and can be found in the MATLAB MathWorks File Exchange
(Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2008b).
   Once ∆u and ∆v corresponding to the cross-correlation peak are found, the dis-
placed image can be relocated to the reference image position through an inverse trans-

   2-D rigid image translation is properly valid only for a perpendicular oriented cam-
era. For an oblique view, the 2-D pixel rigid translation between frames can be in-
terpreted as projections of the camera movement in the azimuth and tilt direction
(∆u = ∆Azimuth, ∆v = ∆T ilt; (Holman and Stanley, 2007; Pearre and Puleo, 2009;
Vousdoukas et al., 2011b)). Given the changes in perspective, the 2-D shifts between
frames will also vary depending on the sub-region of the image. For the present method,
2-D shifts are computed only with the purpose to match keypoints distributed in differ-
ent zones of the image. The stabilization of the whole image, on the other hand, will
be performed using these keypoints with another type of geometric transformation with
more degrees of freedom to account for the image deformation produced by the relative
angle variation of the camera.




   At this stage, the keypoints and their corresponding surrounding zones have been
defined and filtered through the CED in order to extract the edges of the features and
improve the performance of the cross-correlation algorithm. The next step consists to
use these features along consecutive frames to estimate, via sub-pixel cross-correlation,
the two-dimensional displacement of each zone and camera (∆uz,c     z,c

the 2-D sub-pixel shift. Figure 3.3 shows an example of keypoint matching between
a pair of sub-images from zone 1 (z = 1) of camera 2 (c = 2). First, the CED is
applied to both sub-images: the reference sub-image (r = 1; Oct/01/2013 - 09:40:00

pixel shift between frames is subsequently computed using an up-sampling factor of 20:
∆u1,2                   1,2
  1301,1 = −2 pixels, ∆v1301,1 = −29.2 pixels. Finally, the shift is used to translate the

displaced sub-image to match with the keypoint of the reference sub-image represented

age (∆uz,c     z,c                                                            z,c   z,c

routine works under a loop that iterates over all the frames of a given zone and camera.
At each iteration, the algorithm automatically applies a CED to the sub-image zone
and computes the pixel shift of the current frame with respect to the reference frame
(case 1). An additional condition is used to assess the congruence of the estimated pixel
shift. The condition assumes that the pixel shift between consecutive frames is small. A

typical diurnal signal due to thermal expansion is approximately 2-pixel range (Holman
and Stanley, 2007), so even if the image sequence is sub-sampled it is reasonable to
stipulate that the pixel shift of a frame with respect to the previous one should not be
larger than 10 pixels, either in u or v directions. In the case that the condition is not
fulfilled, there is no certain way to discern if the estimated pixel shift is anomalously
large because the cross-correlation algorithm has been fooled or if the displacement is
actually true and resulted from other factors (e.g., human intervention, strong wind,
etc.). The CED plays a critical role in decreasing the effect of brightness and contrast
changes between frames by just retrieving the edges, however, the cross-correlation al-
gorithm is still likely to fail if some edge patterns of the same keypoint do not match, or
even worst, if patterns resemble mistakenly while corresponding to different real-world
patterns. To verify that the two frames are as similar as possible, a second option (case
2) is proposed to estimate ∆uz,c       z,c
                             j,r and ∆vj,r without directly computing the pixel shift

with respect to the reference frame. Instead, the pixel shift is computed with respect to
the previous stabilized frame: f (uz,c    z,c        0 z,c    z,c      0 z,c    z,c
                                   j−1 , vj−1 ) = g(u j−1 − ∆uj−1,r , v j−1 − ∆vj−1,r ), which

in turn is also relative to the reference frame. If despite the above two cases the pixel
shift remains greater than 10 pixels, the algorithm enters in a semi-automatic mode and
offers the user four different options:

•       Keep the pixel shift computed by using the reference frame (case 1).
•       Keep the pixel shift computed by using the previous stabilized frame as reference
        (case 2).
•       Select manually the keypoint position to compute the pixel shift (case 3).
•       Discard the frame (case 4).

An additional visual representation (similar to Figure 3.3) shows the user how the sta-
bilized frame would look like if case 1 or case 2 pixel shift were used. If neither op-
tion is appropriate, the user has the possibility to select manually the keypoint position
(κz,c   z,c
  u0 , κv 0 ) in the current frame in order to compute the correspondent pixel shift (case
    j      j

3). Alternatively, the frame can present serious contamination in the form of sun glint,
raindrops or fog in which case the frame can be discarded (case 4). Finally, the pixel
shift is stored at each iteration so that all the keypoints of a given zone and camera can
be matched against themselves.

3.3.4.4      Geometric transformation



The number of corresponding keypoints identified between images establishes the type
of geometric transformation that can be defined to map and relocate the displaced
image points onto a reference image. A geometric transformation is constrained by the
degrees of freedom (DOF). At least one corresponding keypoint is necessary to estimate
the 2-D rigid translation motion between frames (2 DOF). Two pairs of non-collinear
keypoints are enough to solve the four parameters of a similarity transformation:

defined as a linear combination of translation (∆u, ∆v), rotation (θ) and a scale factor
(s). The rotation is defined as a counter-clockwise rotating angle with respect to the
reference frame and can often be interpreted as the camera angle movement on its roll
axis. The similarity transformation lacks the ability to represent a true three dimen-
sional motion model, however, it can adequately estimate motion between frames if
the camera movement or the scene are constrained to certain conditions (Ortiz Cayon,
2013). Jin et al. (2000) stated that if the translations of the camera are zero and the rel-
ative angle variation of the camera between frames is very small (e.g., less than 5°), the
effect of the depth of scene points can be neglected. This means that camera roll is the
main factor of image rotation (θ = ∆Roll) and small camera azimuth and tilt variations
can be represented by 2-D translations of the image (∆u = ∆Azimuth, ∆v = ∆T ilt).
On the other hand, if image points are of the same depth, or the depth difference among
image points is much less than the average depth (i.e., the camera is far away from the
object), small camera translation will mainly cause homogeneous scaling and transla-
tion of 2-D images (Jin et al., 2001). The latter assumptions are valid for the case
of fixed cameras as long as the viewing angles shift slightly. It is important to note
that camera orientation always goes in the opposite direction from the relative frame
displacements with respect to the reference image (Figure 3.5).

   Working with a similarity transformation has the advantage to be fast and simple
in terms of computational complexity (Lim et al., 2017). The similarity motion param-
eters can be estimated over an iterative process using the keypoints correspondences
of all sub-images zones for every frame of a given camera. These parameters allow
performing a global transformation to warp and stabilize the whole image sequence.


3.3.4.5   Image geo-rectification

After all the images are correctly stabilized, the coordinates of the 2-D images (u, v)
must be transformed to 3-D real-world coordinates (x, y, z) through a photogrammetric
transformation. The determination of the transformation is called camera calibration
and involves two sets of parameters: extrinsic and intrinsic parameters. The extrinsic
parameters contain the information related to the position and orientation of the cam-
era (the three coordinates of the camera location and the three rotation angles) and the
intrinsic parameters comprise the physical characteristics of the lens of the camera (the
image center coordinates, the effective focal length and the scale factors). Direct linear
transformation (DLT) developed by Abdel-Aziz and Karara (1971) is perhaps the most
commonly used camera calibration method because it does not require initial knowl-
edge of the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters (Sánchez-García et al., 2017). These
parameters are implicit in the 11 transformation parameters, however, nonlinear effects
such as radial distortion are not taken into account and can lead to coupling errors be-
tween parameters affecting the camera calibration accuracy (Zhao et al., 2016). DLT

method represents a closed form solution requiring non-coplanar real-world surveyed
GCPs with corresponding image coordinates. Each GCP generates two linear equations
that can be expressed as the following matrix multiplication:


                                                                        

where L = (L1 , L2 , ..., L11 )T are the transformation parameters. At least six GCPs are
necessary to build an overdetermined set of linear equations to estimate the 11 trans-
formation parameters using a least square method. The limitation of working with one
single camera, or many cameras that are not looking at the same object, is that one
coordinate must be constrained to a fixed value to allow inverse mapping. When study-
ing the nearshore zone, the vertical coordinate (z) is usually assigned to be equal to
the instant sea level. However, if the topography is known and the swash zone is the
subject of study (e.g., wave runup), an iterative rectification method using the beach
topography can be applied to reduce rectification positioning errors as described by
Blenkinsopp et al. (2016).

   Another popular calibration method is the one proposed by Holland et al. (1997). In
their method, they solve the five intrinsic parameters in lab and solve the six remaining
extrinsic parameters using at least three GCPs and a standard nonlinear solver (Holman
et al., 2017; Bergsma et al., 2019). The intrinsic parameters can be estimated using the
Caltech camera calibration toolbox for Matlab (Bouguet, 2015) prior to camera instal-
lation in order to remove lens distortion. Although there are many well-documented
camera calibration methods (Faig, 1975; Tsai, 1987; Clarke and Fryer, 1998; Wang
et al., 2010), deciding which one to use is up to the user convenience.

   For this particular paper, DLT was used to generate the plan-view (geo-rectified)
images considering 8-10 GCPs per camera. Images were merged and projected into a
horizontal plane with a grid size of 1×1 m and elevation equal to mean high water neaps
(zM HW N = 0.86 m). In addition, non-stabilized and stabilized geo-rectified images
were compared to estimate the induced real-world positioning error due to camera
movement.

3.3.5     Results
3.3.5.1      Keypoint tracking


The stabilization method was applied to 5 years of daily images collected from the
permanent three-camera video system located at Anglet Beach. Figure 3.6 illustrates
estimates of horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (tilt) displacements of the four key-
points distributed at different sub-image regions of camera 2 (see Figure 3.2). Azimuth
and tilt deviations were expressed as pixel differences from the initial image position
(Oct/01/2013 - 09:40:00 GMT). Results show a high variability in the position of the
four keypoints indicating that the camera has been moving throughout the study period.
Deviations of azimuth and tilt varied respectively from -10 pixels to 8 pixels and -33 pix-
els to 2 pixels. The standard deviation of the detrended pixel displacement, which is a
measure of the magnitude of camera movements, was 2 and 5 pixels in the horizontal
and vertical directions, respectively. The camera oblique view generated an approxi-
mately constant offset (0.2 pixels horizontal; 0.4 pixels vertical) in the displacement
between zones. An annual motion signal (≈4 pixels amplitude) together with a quasi-
steady trend (1.6 pixels/year horizontal; -3.4 pixels/year vertical) can be identified,
suggesting that camera 2 orientation has been gradually moving towards the southwest
direction.

3.3.5.2   Camera movement correction

Figure 3.7 shows the evolution of the transformation parameters (translation, rotation
and scaling) derived from a Euclidean (a.k.a Similarity) transformation for the three-
camera video system. All cameras showed motion throughout the study period on a
wide range of time scales. Camera 1, 2 and 3 movement amplitude reached approxi-
mately 5.6 pixels, 10.4 pixels and 5.7 pixels in azimuth and 9.5 pixels, 30.7 pixels and
15.1 pixels in tilt, respectively. The standard deviation of detrended azimuth for the
three cameras was 1.5 pixels, 2.5 pixels and 1.4 pixels with trends of -0.8 pixels/year,
1.6 pixels/year and -0.4 pixels/year. Respectively, the standard deviation of detrended
tilt was 2.9 pixels, 4.7 pixels and 1.8 pixels with trends of 0.8 pixels/year, -2.9 pix-
els/year and -2.1 pixels/year. An annual signal of about 0.6 pixels (camera 1), 2.3
pixels (camera 2) and 0.4 pixels (camera 3) in azimuth and 1.9 pixels (camera 1), 4.2
pixels (camera 2) and 1.8 pixels (camera 3) in tilt deviation were apparent on the total
record. Moreover, the three cameras presented variations in roll angle up to 0.4°, 0.2°
and 0.1° with a standard deviation of 0.05°, 0.03° and 0.03° for camera 1, 2 and 3,
respectively. Camera 1 and 2 exhibited an increasing counter-clockwise trend in roll
angle (0.08°/year and 0.03°/year, respectively) over the 5-year time series. An overall
enlargement was notable after 2015, particularly for camera 1. The scale factor (s)
increased up to 10% the image size of camera 1 and 3% the image size of camera 2.
Camera 3 presented no significant changes in image scale (maximum of 0.6%).
   The transformation parameters were used to warp and align the whole image se-
quence with the reference frame. Figure 3.8 shows the long-term averaged video (span-
ning the complete time series) using raw video frames and corrected frames from cam-
era 2. The raw input mean is blurry (Figure 3.8a) indicating significant image shifts
induced by the camera movement. The mean of the corrected frames (Figure 3.8b)
shows the efficacy of the stabilization method by preserving the same image sharpness
(of the fixed features) as the reference frame.

3.3.5.3   Geo-rectification error

Camera movements result not only in image deformation but also in geo-rectification
errors. Figure 3.9 provides an example of positioning error due to camera motion. A
comparison between stabilized and unstabilized geo-rectified images for a specific date
is presented together with a spatial description of the error to highlight the impact of
camera viewing angle deviations. Figure 3.9a shows the reference frame (Oct/01/2013
- 09:40:00 GMT) plain view image in real-world coordinates obtained after geo-
rectification of the time-exposure images collected from the three-camera video system.
Figure 3.9b,c show geo-rectification of a subsequent image when large camera view-
ing angle deviation was present (Feb/06/2018 - 09:15:00 GMT; same date chosen as
for Figure 3.3). Figure 3.9b considers stabilization of the time-exposure images before
geo-rectification, while Figure 3.9c does not take it into account. Figure 3.9d presents
                                        q
the associated geo-rectification error ( alongshore error2 + cross-shore error2 ) of Fig-
ure 3.9c produced by camera movement. This error depends on the grazing angle
and lens properties and typically increases with increasing distance from the camera
(Bouvier et al., 2019). The comparison between images highlights the differences in
position, size and shape of fixed objects when stabilization is omitted. For this partic-
ular date, horizontal errors exceed 400 m (400 m in the alongshore and 100 m in the
cross-shore direction). For instance, a displacement of the groins is readily apparent,
with the alongshore location of the right-hand groin varying from 1750 m to 2000 m.
Furthermore, the whole beach area appeared to shrink approximately 50 m in contrast
to the stabilized geo-rectified image. The geo-rectified image that considered stabiliza-
tion kept the groins well aligned with respect to their original position, with all the fixed
objects retaining their initial size and shape.

3.3.6    Discussion

The semi-automatic stabilization method was applied to 5 years of daily time-exposure
images collected from three synchronized cameras located at Anglet Beach, southwest
France. For keypoint matching, approximately 1500 frames were processed for each
sub-image zone requiring an average processing time between 1 s and 4 s per frame
on a standard commercial personal computer (4th generation Core i5-4690, 3.5 GHz).
The distribution of cases used to compute the 2-D pixel shift displacement for each
keypoint (Figure 3.4) gives an estimation of the performance of the algorithm in terms
of how much user assistance was required. For example, just for sub-image zone 1 of
camera 2, 97% of the pixel shifts were computed using case 1, 0.92% were computed
using case 2, 0.26% using case 3 and 1.7% using case 4. This means that four frames,

corresponding to that zone, required manually pixel shift computation and 26 frames
were manually discarded. The overall distribution of cases used for all cameras and
all sub-image zones was: 90.42% (case 1), 1.38% (case 2), 4.91% (case 3) and 3.28%
(case 4). It is important to note that some matching cases corresponding to case 1 and
case 2 also required user visual control. User confirmation for those cases was necessary
when the automatically computed pixel shift between consecutive frames was larger
than the threshold (10 pixels) but still correct. Much of the user intervention essentially
consisted of discarding low-quality frames. For future work, a possible improvement
could be achieved by pre-selecting frames or explore this issue further by developing a
separate procedure to automatically keep/discard frames prior to image stabilization.




   The use of the CED is crucial for a robust performance of the cross-correlation al-
gorithm when differences in contrast, brightness and illumination conditions between
frames are present. Figure 3.10 shows the effect of the CED on the stabilization with re-
spect to a reference sub-image (Figure 3.10a,e,i) under three representative cases of il-
lumination conditions: under shinny (overexposed image; Figure 3.10b), cloudy (high-
contrast image; Figure 3.10f) and foggy (low-contrast image; Figure 3.10j) weather
conditions. The cross-correlation between sub-images without CED determines the
similarity between frames based on their color/grayscale pixel intensity. This means
that the performance of the cross-correlation not only depends on the features present
in the frame, but also on changes in light conditions between frames. Large changes
can lead to errors as shown in Figure 3.10c,g,k. On the other hand, when using the
CED, pixels intensities are converted to only two possible values: 1 if edges that define
the boundaries of the features are detected and 0 if not. The efficiency of the cross-
correlation in combination with the CED relies upon the fact that the amount of data
to be processed is reduced. Moreover, the cross-correlation algorithm together with the
CED estimates the similarity between frames based only on the boundaries and edges
detected, regardless of contrast and brightness variations between frames, as long as
the features are still visible and easily recognizable by their shape and form (Figure
3.10d,h,l).

match between frames.




   The performance of the cross-correlation algorithm (together with the CED) de-
pends strongly on the land-region zone selected, therefore the sub-image region selec-
tion is the most important step of the method. It is advised to define a large enough
window to allow inter-frame movement not only for the keypoint, but also for the whole
feature (e.g., building structure, billboard, road, etc.) to guarantee better results and
reduce as much as possible user assistance during the pixel shift computation process.
The compromise of having a larger zone-size is just related to the computation time
that it will take for the cross-correlation algorithm to work on each frame. However,
it is more important to be careful to not choose a very small zone where the feature
(including the keypoint) might drift out of view, which in this case, would lead the
cross-correlation algorithm to fail. A limitation of the method is that it requires the
presence of fixed features in the camera view field. However, for fixed video systems
where usually camera viewing angles shift slightly (e.g., less than 5°) and camera trans-
lational movements are small, a similarity transformation (4 DOF) can be performed to

stabilize the images with a minimum of two non-collinear pairs of keypoints between
frames. The advantage of this approach, besides requiring fewer keypoints, is that it
is computationally efficient and robust enough to achieve good results. Nevertheless,
registration reliability and accuracy can be increased by selecting more landmarks in
the image. Having more spread keypoints in the image reduces foreground-background
bias and also allows the possibility to implement other more complex types of geometric
transformations with higher degrees of freedom (Hartley and Zisserman, 2004), such
as a 2-D affine (6 DOF) or planar nonlinear homography (8 DOF) transformation to
remove perspective deformation introduced by the camera oblique view (really neces-
sary for UAVs). The method has been tested on UAV flights (data not shown) showing
that the performance largely improves (with 99% matches for case 1 and case 2) when
using higher frequency frame rates (>1 Hz) during smaller periods of time (<20 min),
although other geometric transformations with higher degrees of freedom are necessary
due to the fact that camera translation movements become significant.

   The time evolution of the transformation parameters show that camera movements
occur on a wide range of timescales (see Figure 3.7). The annual signal in azimuth and
tilt deviation can potentially be attributed to the sun position and thermal expansion
fluctuations (Bouvier et al., 2019). It is important to note that all cameras were in-
stalled inside the lighthouse mounted in a wooden structure and isolated by an acrylic
glass from the outside elements, so wind is not expected to be a source of camera
motion for the present study. While movements were likely occurring for all cameras,
the effects of azimuth and tilt motion were most notable for camera 2 (which had the
longest focal length; 25 mm lens) and less evident for camera 3 (wide-angle 8 mm
lens). This is in line with Pearre and Puleo (2009), who previously showed that the
longer the focal length (e.g., 50 mm), the smaller the angle of view and the larger the
sensitivity to cause significant changes in image location even for small changes in the
tilt of the camera. Moreover, small changes in perspective were found to modify the size
of the objects (uniform scaling) when objects were far away from the camera, as shown
in Figure 3.7d for camera 1. On the other hand, the quasi-steady counter-clockwise
trend observed in roll angle (Figure 3.7c) suggests that the wooden structure where the
cameras are mounted is gradually arcing with time, although this cannot be verified.

Previous studies have shown that small camera viewing angle deviations can induce sig-
nificant changes in image location and, in turn, introduce large geo-rectification errors
(Pearre and Puleo, 2009; Bouvier et al., 2019; Bergsma et al., 2019). However, besides
camera variation angles, the related error is also modulated with the pixel footprint
that depends on the distance from the camera and the lens properties. For example,
even though camera 2 presented the largest deviations in azimuth and tilt (see Figure
3.6), its associated geo-rectification error was slightly lower with respect to the other
cameras for the same distances (see Figure 3.9d). This result might be explained by
the fact that camera 2 has a higher pixel resolution and hence a lower pixel footprint
that counteracts for the induced pixels real-world location error. Nevertheless, evidence
still points out that geo-rectification errors induced by camera movement can become
significant and should not be neglected. In an attempt to demonstrate the impact of
this error (in perhaps the most common coastal video application), 2.5 km of shore-
line were manually digitized for the outstanding winter period of 2013/2014 (Castelle
et al., 2015; Masselink et al., 2016; Castelle et al., 2017a) using non-stabilized and
stabilized time-exposure geo-rectified images to estimate the real-world horizontal po-
sitioning error due to camera movement (Figure 3.11). The mean shoreline position
(intersection of wet and dry parts of the beach (Coco et al., 2005)) was defined as
the alongshore-averaged shoreline position. The alongshore standard deviation of the
shoreline position was also computed to give a measure of the alongshore variability
of the cross-shore position. During the winter period of 2013/2014 high-energy wave
conditions (Hs > 5 m) drove important changes in Anglet Beach shoreline dynamics
(Huguet et al., 2016). Part of the seasonal erosion cycle is captured in Figure 3.11
where the shoreline position varied around a range of 30 m. The mean shoreline appar-
ent position was also affected by an approximately 10-20 m bias showing that incorrect
tilt may bias positions of features by condensing or stretching the image in the cross-
shore direction. This result highlights that overlooking camera movement can result in
strongly under- or over- estimation of shoreline response to extreme events.

3.3.7    Conclusions

In this paper, we developed an efficient semi-automatic method to remove unwanted
camera movement after video acquisition. The method consisted in defining and track-
ing a few fixed feature points between consecutive frames using Guizar-Sicairos et al.
(2007) sub-pixel cross-correlation algorithm together with a CED (Canny, 1986). The
use of the CED greatly improved the performance of the cross-correlation algorithm
by making it more robust against contrast and luminosity brightness variations. The
tracked features allowed to compute the parameters of a similarity transformation
(translation, rotation and scale) to estimate the motion between frames and compensate
for it. For the keypoint matching, the method worked under a scheme of four cases. The
algorithm was capable of computing automatically the 2-D sub-pixel shift of a keypoint
with respect to an initial position as long as the displacements between consecutive
frames remained smaller than 10 pixels. Otherwise, user input was required to discern
if the calculated pixel shift was legitimate or the frame had to be discarded. Results
showed that the semi-automatic method is able to process at least 90% of the frames
without user assistance. However, future work should examine the possibility to auto-
matically discard low-quality images acquired under adverse rain or foggy conditions in

order to reduce user intervention. Image stabilization is a fundamental post-processing
step that should always be performed in coastal imaging applications to increase the ac-
curacy of video-derived products, such as shoreline/sandbar position, wave celerity and
depths estimate. The framework presented here opens new perspectives and appears
as a promising tool for other coastal imaging applications such as removal of undesired
high-frequency jitters from UAVs.

        CHAPTER 4. NEARSHORE BATHYMETRIC MAPPING FROM VIDEO IMAGERY




4.1     Preamble

This chapter comprises the results of the work performed during my second year of
my PhD. Once the images were stabilized and corrected from camera movement, the
main objective was to implement an existing video-based linear depth inversion algo-
rithm (cBathy; Holman et al. 2013) in order to investigate PCA beach morphological
response and time evolution during the storm events of October 2018 field campaign.
One important aspect was to assess video-derived bathymetries with available topo-
bathymetry surveys and evaluate the performance of cBathy under high-energy wave
conditions since cBathy has been rarely tested in beach environments with waves larger
than 2 m height.
   The following sections of this chapter describe the most popular methods, currently
available, for obtaining intertidal and subtidal bathymetry based on video remote sens-
ing techniques. The spectral depth inversion method cBathy (Holman et al., 2013) is
introduced, applied and discussed, and the results are placed into perspective with the
limitations of the optical conditions and the physics assumptions.




4.2     Introduction

Bathymetry is probably the most critical variable for understanding and modelling the
hydro-sedimentary processes and variability of the nearshore, yet it is often poorly
known (Holman et al., 2013). Morphological changes of the beach profile are spread
over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales that vary from a few hours (storm) to sev-
eral weeks (changes in swell regimes) at the scale from ripples to sandbars. Decisions
on coastal zone management are mainly based on understanding sediment budgets and
the location and health of beach sand volumes (Davidson et al., 2007). This is a chal-
lenging task since, the impact on, and recovery rate of the sub- and inter-tidal zone
varies greatly depending on the location (Masselink et al., 2016).

   Until the 1990s, one common way of directly measuring beach profiles was through
the use of bottom-contacting vehicles such as the Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy
(CRAB; Birkemeier and Mason 1984) in combination with a fathometer to compile a
comprehensive bathymetry. Nowadays, in situ bathymetric data is traditionally obtained
using an echo sounder mounted behind a jet ski (Dugan et al., 2001) or a small ves-
sel (MacMahan, 2001) equipped with a Real-Time Kinematic and Differential Global
Positioning System (RTK DGPS) sensor that can retrieve depths within a couple of cen-
timeters accuracy (Van Son et al., 2009). Although these methods are accurate, for
logistical and economic reasons, in situ beach surveys are usually performed at most
twice per month and are restricted to periods of fair weather conditions with low waves
(Honegger et al., 2019). Consequently, considerable effort has gone into the devel-
opment of a wide range of depth measurements techniques based on remote sensing
that exploit various depth signatures in order to fill the spatial and temporal gaps in
surveyed bathymetry Holland et al. (2018).



4.3     Indirect bathymetric mapping

The following subsections will give a brief overview regarding the research that have
been done using remote sensing, with special focus on optical methods, to estimate the
nearshore bathymetry.


4.3.1    Intertidal bathymetry mapping

Plant and Holman (1997) proposed the first method to map the intertidal beach
bathymetry based on the composition of different shoreline elevation contours through-
out a tidal cycle.   Greyscale timex images are used to detect the shoreline (de-
fined as the transition zone between beach pixels and water pixels) by extracting the
pixel "Shore-Line Intensitiy Maximum" (SLIM) at which wave breaking is maximized.
High-frequency intensities that are caused by individual waves and foam motion are
smoothed by time-averaging images to isolate a mean shoreline position. As the tidal
elevation is known at each time, the video-detected shoreline can be associated to a
particular elevation. Thus, a time series of shoreline elevation contours from low tide to

                                           57


           CHAPTER 4. NEARSHORE BATHYMETRIC MAPPING FROM VIDEO IMAGERY


high tide can be combined to reconstruct the three-dimensional intertidal bathymetry.
Aarninkhof et al. (2003) improved this method by incorporating RGB-color timex im-
ages for an easier shoreline detection as well as concurrent tide and wave data. Pixels
are clustered in a hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space where the shoreline is defined
as the transition between water and land pixels. Almar et al. (2012b) extended this ap-
proach by using a Minimum Shoreline Variability (MSV) method to detect shorelines at
complex meso-macro tidal beaches subject to high energy waves.
   Although intertidal bathymetry mapping based on video techniques has proven to
be very useful, it is not the main challenge of this work, as one can survey the intertidal
zone by traditional means at low tide. The scope and interest relies on estimating
the subtidal bathymetry which is both expensive and highly time consuming through
surveys.



4.3.2      Subtidal bathymetry mapping

Maximum pixel intensities corresponding to wave breaking can also be used to esti-
mate two- and three-dimensional subtidal morphology. For example, the location of the
sandbar(s) can be determined by identifying one or more white alongshore bands of
high intensity (Lippmann and Holman, 1989, 1990; Van Enckevort and Ruessink, 2003;
van Enckevort et al., 2004). Several remote sensing approaches have been suggested
to estimate the subtidal bathymetry. Among these group of methods are the one based
on light penetration in the water column and the subsequent reflection of the seabed
(see subsection 4.3.2.1) and the one based on sea surface characteristics. The latter
group can broadly be subdivided into methods that rely on wave dissipation patterns
caused by depth-induced wave breaking (see subsection 4.3.2.2) and changes in local
wave celerity over a varying depth profile (see subsection 4.3.2.3).


4.3.2.1     Multi- and hyperspectral depth inversion

For clear water with a visible bottom, multi- or hyperspectral sensors display color vari-
ations that can be correlated to depth (Lyzenga and Ahrens, 1978; Lee et al., 1999;
Mobley et al., 2005; Lyzenga et al., 2006). As different colors penetrate water at differ-

                                                 4.3. INDIRECT BATHYMETRIC MAPPING


ent depths, the disparity between them can provide information about the depth. For
example, Mobley et al. (2005) created a database based on remote-sensing reflectance
according to different water depths, so that the measured reflectance for a particular im-
age pixel could be matched with a look-up-table and inverted to retrieve water depth.
Although this depth-by-colour method can provide relatively inexpensive high-spatial
resolution bathymetry maps, the method generally requires in-situ ground calibration
which limits this technique to accessible areas only (Almar et al., 2019). Moreover, in-
version methods from multi- or hyperspectral satellite are subject to atmospheric and
water clarity, while coastal waters in many areas of the world, including the current
study site, are often turbid (Gao, 2009).


4.3.2.2   Depth estimation from wave energy dissipation

Local depth information can be obtained by coupling the pixel intensities to wave energy
dissipation rates in relation to an underlying depth profile (Battjes and Janssen, 1978).
Under this concept, Aarninkhof and Ruessink (2004); Aarninkhof et al. (2005, 2006)
developed a method where cross-shore breaking-wave dissipation patterns from timex
images are compared with numerical modelled dissipation proxies over a series of test
bathymetries to find the one that is most consistent with observations. van Dongeren
et al. (2008) extended this wave dissipation method through a data-model assimilation
framework called Beach Wizard. Moreover, Wilson et al. (2010) showed that through
further data assimilation (the addition of wave and current measurements) using an
ensemble Kalman filter, the accuracy of an updated modelled bathymetry can be en-
hanced. The main drawback of wave energy dissipation methods is that evidently they
are limited to wave breaking areas (e.g., surf zone) and require full numerical model
run for each guess which makes it difficult for operational purposes.


4.3.2.3   Depth inversion through wave dispersion relationship

One of the most common approach to estimate water depth is through the wave disper-
sion relationship which for the simplest case is derived from linear wave theory under
the assumption of small amplitude waves and locally horizontal bottom. In this case,
the radial frequency ω (2π/T ) is directly related to the water depth h, the gravitational

acceleration (g) and the radial wave number k (2π/L), as shown in the following equa-
tion:

   The term uk accounts for the Doppler shift due to mean currents (u). This term is
often neglected for open beaches with small influence of rip currents since u is consid-
ered to be small compared to the wave celerity in the same direction as u. Wave celerity
or phase speed c in the absence of Doppler shifts is expressed as:

   From Eq. 4.1 and 4.2 the celerity of a wave, based on linear wave theory is:

   Attemps to retrieve nearshore bathymetry from Eq. 4.4 have been investigated since
World War II (Williams, 1947). Sequences of air photos of enemy-held beaches were
manually analyzed to determine wavelengths L and wave periods T (Johnson, 1949;
Fuchs, 1953). Nowadays, the use of depth inversion from linear wave dispersion has
been extended to X-Band radars (Bell, 1999; Bell and Osler, 2011), satellites (Mancini
et al., 2012; Bian et al., 2020) and of course video-monitoring stations (Stockdon and
Holman, 2000; Holman et al., 2013). It is important to note that the linear dispersion
relation implies that depths can only be inverted to a limited depth which theoreti-
cally corresponds to intermediate water depths (in practice: h < L/2). The validity
of the linear dispersion relation is also bounded to the increasing degree of wave non-
linearity (finite amplitude effects) as waves approach the shore leading to larger propa-
gation speeds for higher waves (Grilli, 1998; Bergsma and Almar, 2018). Correction for
finite-amplitude dispersion in shallow water requires a modification in the wave celerity
                    p
equation, i.e., c = g(h + H) which implies knowledge of the wave height H that is

usually unknown and difficult to obtain remotely. Examples of depth inversion through
non-linear wave dispersion relationship are addressed by Holland (2001); Catálan and
Haller (2008); Almar et al. (2011). The application of non-linear depth inversion re-
quires either in-situ wave data or a computation effort which is additional compared to
the linear dispersion relationship (Bergsma, 2017).

   Two different approaches for depth inversion using the linear dispersion relation-
ship are applied in nearshore video camera systems; a temporal and a spectral method
(Bergsma and Almar, 2018). The temporal method (Almar et al., 2009) correlates time-
varying wave signals between neighboring positions from timestack images to find the
best correlation that is related to wave celerity. The spectral method (Plant et al., 2008;
Holman et al., 2013) transforms a spatial neighborhood of pixel intensity time series
to the frequency domain for cross-spectral analysis and complex Empirical Orthogonal
Function (EOF) analysis in order to derive the most coherent and dominant frequency
and wavenumber pairs. Although both approaches result in depth estimates with simi-
lar accuracy using synthetic cases (Bergsma and Almar, 2018), the spectral method has
the advantage to be extended into two spatial dimensions while the cross-correlation
temporal method is limited to one-dimension and subject to errors for an oblique wave
incidence angle (Thuan et al., 2019). Another advantage of the spectral method over
the temporal method is that a larger amount of signals in space and time are used for
each point where the bathymetry is intended to be estimated. For weakly monochro-
matic noisy wave conditions, the spectral method is then often more robust than the
temporal method (Bouvier, 2019).

   The cBathy algorithm, developed by (Holman et al., 2013), is a spectral depth inver-
sion method that has been widely used in nearshore regions (intermediate and shallow
water) to remotely estimate bathymetric data (Brodie et al., 2018). It incorporates a
temporal Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960) based on present and prior bathymetric esti-
mates to provide robustness in case of sporadic camera or weather problems such as
fog or rain. Although cBathy was originally conceived for fixed shore-based coastal
monitoring video stations, its implementation has also been tested on X-band radars
(Honegger et al., 2019, 2020) and UAVs (Aarnink, 2017; Bergsma et al., 2019). The
cBathy algorithm consist of three phases that will be explained in the section below.

4.4     cBathy algorithm

The    cBathy     algorithm     (Holman      et    al.   2013;       https://github.com/
Coastal-Imaging-Research-Network/cBathy-toolbox) is based on the linear
wave dispersion relationship to estimate depth and thus requires a time series of
images with the presence of waves in intermediate and shallow water. Images are
typically sampled at 1 or 2 Hz over a 17-min collection to yield a burst or stack of
images. Data runs are typically collected hourly but can be reduced to half-hourly for
field experiments or places where conditions (for example, tide or morphology) change
rapidly. The image spatial resolution should be adequate to resolve the anticipated
dominant wavelengths. It is recommended that no fewer than four pixels per expected
wavelength be used for sampling. For the case of Anglet beach, the wavelength for
a typical 10-s wave in 1 m depth is ∼31 m. This means that for a cross-shore (∆xp )
and alongshore (∆yp ) spacing of 5 and 10 m, respectively, 6 points will be provided
in the cross-shore to resolve the wavelength, which is fine to keep computation time
reasonable (alongshore scales are longer, so can be well resolved with a larger sample
spacing). Once the stack of images is recorded the analysis is carried out sequentially
at a series of user-selected analysis points (xm , ym ) for which a group of neighboring
pixels is used within a user-specified range (xm ± Lx , ym ± Ly ) or tile (Figure 4.1).

   cBathy algorithm consist of three processing steps or phases. The objective of phase
1 is to estimate a wavenumber k at the point (xm , ym ) for a user-defined set of candidate
frequencies fb . These frequencies fb are typically defined between 0.056 and 0.250 Hz
and correspond to wave periods ranging from 4 to 18 s. Each pixel within the analysis
tile (xm ±Lx , ym ±Ly ) is treated as an individual pixel intensity time series and converted
to the frequency domain through a Fourier transformation. A cross-spectral matrix is
then computed between all possible pixel pairs inside the tile for each of the desired
frequency bands fb . A selection of the most coherent frequencies (commonly four;
cBathy default value) are identified and extracted through spatial empirical orthogonal
function (EOF) to determine the dominant spatial phase of the wave. The corresponding
wavenumbers k are derived by fitting the wave patterns of the observed spatial phase
to a forward modelled wave train. A skill value is provided to indicate the percentage

of the variance explained by the fit where a skill score of 1 corresponds to a perfect
match. Finally, for each fb − k pair, a depth h̃(xm , ym ) can be estimated using the linear
dispersion relationship (Eq. 4.4). Since cBathy estimates depth, not bathymetry, tidal
elevations must be subtracted from estimates to yield depths relative to a fixed tidal
datum.

   In phase 2, a single depth ĥ(xm , ym ) is computed by combining the multiple fb − k
pairs estimated from phase 1 through a weighted non-linear least squares fit so that
the best correspondence to the linear dispersion relationship is found. Phase 2 depths,

like those of phase 1, must be tide-corrected to yield bathymetry data referenced with
respect to a tidal datum.

   Phase 3 uses a Kalman filter (Kalman, 1960) to smooth and average the datum-
referenced depths in order to provide a robust and reliable depth estimate, h(xm , ym ).
As the Kalman filter depends on both the current and the previous cBathy-estimated
bathymetry, this step only works if more than one video-derived bathymetry is available.
The purpose of the Kalman filter is to provide an estimate of beach morphology over
certain areas even when in situ conditions are not favorable by filling gaps in coverage
and objectively averaging new estimates with prior estimates.




4.5     cBathy results and previous validation

The quality of bathymetric estimates derived from cBathy has previously been compared
with conventional bathymetric surveys obtained from echo sounder and acoustic altime-
ters for a number of different beaches (summarized in Table 4.1). However, cBathy has
rarely been tested in beach environments with waves bigger than 1.7 m, and almost
never in presence of waves bigger than 2 m with Tp >10 s due to the difficulty of con-
ducting in situ surveys in the presence of large waves (Brodie et al., 2018). As shown
in Table 4.1, the discrepancies between measured and computed (cBathy) bathymetric
data range from 0.34 to 2.05 m and from 0 to 0.92 m, RMSE and bias, respectively. The
error variability depends largely on the resolution of the video system, site morphology,
and hydrodynamic conditions at the time of acquisition. Maximum errors are usually
located offshore, several hundred meters away from the video system due to the alter-
ation of the pixel footprint, and close to the shoreline where analysis tiles tend to mix
information from waves, swash and static dry sand (Holman et al., 2013). Moreover,
saturation of the surf zone, due to (large) waves breaking, affects the readability of
the wave signature and thus compromises the accuracy of cBathy performance (Bouvier
et al., 2020). As stated before, errors are often larger in shallow waters where linear
theory becomes less valid due to wave breaking and finite amplitude effects (Holland
et al., 2001; Bergsma and Almar, 2018).

4.6        cBathy settings for PCA beach field experiment



The objective of this study is to determine PCA beach morphological time evolution
during October 2018 field experiment and assess the ability of cBathy algorithm to esti-
mate nearshore bathymetries under high-energy waves. For this purpose, 1-Hz sampled
images were continuously collected during daylight hours on 5,8-15,18-30/Oct/2018
(Figure 2.8d and 4.5). Images were collected from a single camera (cam4) located on
top of Biarritz lighthouse (Figure 2.6 and 2.7). Following subsection 4.4, time series of
images were rotated and rearranged into stacks of ∼17 min (1024 s) duration yielding
one image-stack every 30 min. cBathy algorithm (v1.2) was then applied to a total of
330 image-stacks. The parameters used for cBathy are shown in Table 4.2. Time series
of water depth were estimated on a 25×10 m analysis grid (alongshore × cross-shore
spacing) and further referenced to NGF-IGN69 (Global French Levelling) to produce
bathymetry maps. The Kalman filter was then consecutively applied over time to yield
a stable running average depth by automatically weighting better estimates from prior
information. It should be noted that for the 5th of October 2018 (the same day as the
first bathymetry survey) only one image-stack was available, meaning that the Kalman
filter could not be applied during that day.

4.7     Topo-bathymetry surveys comparison

As previously described in subsection 2.2.1, during October 2018, several surveys were
conducted with the purpose to quantify inter- and sub-tidal morphological variations
throughout the experiment. Inter-tidal topography surveys were performed on 15
and 24 October, and bathymetry surveys were performed on 5 and 26 October 2018.
As shown in Figure 4.3, comparison between surveys indicate the formation of an
alonghore uniform sandbar centered at cross-shore position = 300 m with a net depo-
sition of sand (around 1-m of accretion) at the respectively longshore and cross-shore
position (400 m, 300 m). The overall erosion in the cross-shore distance between 400
and 600 m indicates an overall onshore sediment transport that drove the development
of the bar, as well as beach accretion (at cross-shore position ≈ 100 m), despite the
moderate- to high-energy wave conditions during that period. The development of a
shallow rip channel is also observed at alongshore distance = 400−500 m and cross-
shore distance = 250 m.

   It was decided not to merge the bathymetry data collected on 5 October with the to-
pography collected on 15 October, as a high-energy wave event occurred between both
dates (Hs up to 4 m on 7 October 2018; see figure 2.8) potentially inducing changes in
the sea bed morphology. On the other hand, the topographic and bathymetric data col-
lected on 24 and 26 October 2018, respectively, were interpolated and merged together
to produce a single bathy-topo map. Thus, only the bathymetry data (05/Oct/2018),
as well as the topo-bathymetric ensemble (24,26/Oct/2018) representing the morpho-
logical conditions during the beginning and end of the experiment, respectively, will be
used as ground truth to further validate cBathy estimations.

Figure 4.3 presents the non-filtered cBathy bathymetry estimation computed for the
same day as the first bathymetry survey (05/Oct/2018). Wave and tide conditions dur-
ing cBathy computation (Hs = 0.55 m; Tp = 12.5 s; θp = 3.6°; Tide = 1.58 m) showed
no wave breaking as illustrated in the standard deviation image (Figure 4.3a). The
bulk performance of cBathy to reproduce morphological features present in the first
bathymetry survey achieves 0.57 m root-mean-square-error (RMSE) with 0.37 m bias.
The intermediate water region comprised between alongshore distance = 350−800 and

cross-shore distance = 300−450 is well reproduced by cBathy. However, the remain-
ing shallow water regions, including the sandbar, are fairly reproduced in shape, but
overestimated in depth (inaccuracies around 1 m), as shown in Figure 4.3d and the
cross-shore and alongshore profile transects in Figure 4.3e,f.

   Figure 4.4 shows the estimated Karman-filtered cBathy bathymetry correspond-
ing to the topo-bathymetry survey conducted by the end of the field experiment
(24,26/Oct/2018). The standard deviation image (Figure 4.4a) depicts an oblique rip
channel within the surf zone between alongshore distance = 400-500 consistent with
the surveyed topo-bathy map (Figure 4.4c). However, this rip channel is not resolved by
cBathy estimations. cBathy shows an overall RMSE and bias of 0.56 and 0.29 m, respec-
tively, with larger errors near the steep shoreline and reef location, as shown in Figure
4.4d and the cross-shore and alongshore profile transects in Figure 4.4e,f. cBathy per-
formance is hypothesized to be lowered by wave breaking due to low tide and relatively
large waves (Hs = 0.85 m; Tp = 12.5 s; θp = 16°; Tide = -1.28 m).

4.8.2    cBathy video-derived morphological evolution

Figure 4.5 shows the two bathymetric surveys conducted on 5 and 24-26 October 2018
(top panels), as well as six of the most representative cBathy video-derived bathyme-
tries. Standard deviation images are also included to highlight preferential wave break-
ing and provide visual aid to detect morphological features and validate if they are in
agreement with the corresponding bathymetric estimates. The hours of video recording
from which the 330 bathymetries were computed are indicated over the time series of
tidal elevation and significant wave height Hs . The bathymetry time evolution shows
the transition from a Low Tide Terrace (LTT) to a Transverse Bar and Rip (TBR) beach
state according to Wright and Short (1984) classification. During the beginning of the
field experiment, the sandy bed morphology was reasonably uniform alongshore show-
ing a terrace bar attached to the shore with a slight central crest located around 250 m
in the cross-shore. At high tide when waves were less than 1 m height, waves passed
over the sandbar without breaking until they reach the beach face, much like in a re-
flective beach. Throughout the experiment wave energy increased over time (Hs > 1
m up to 4 m on 07/Oct/2018) inducing the formation of rip channels with an oblique
orientation and thus introducing morphological discontinuities in the surf zone area.

4.8.3    cBathy video-derived profile response

Different cross-shore profile transects were selected (Figure 4.6e) to investigate the
temporal evolution of the sandbar position over the 3-week field experiment. Wave and
tide conditions are presented in order to associate morphological evolution to hydro-
dynamic conditions at PCA beach (Figure 4.6a). Unexpectedly, all beach profiles (Fig-
ure 4.6e,f,g) show an unusual diurnal fluctuation in depth (around 1- to 1.5-m depth
amplitude). A close inspection of the profile temporal evolution reveals a direct tide
dependency on this high-frequency depth fluctuation, where high (low) tide is associ-
ated with deeper (shallow) profiles. This non-physical depth inaccuracy was removed
by applying a moving-average with a temporal window of two (daylight) days over the
whole bathymetry time series.
   The smoothed cross-shore profile time-evolution (Figure 4.7e) shows an overall sand
deposition close to the reef by the end of October 2018 linked by the increasingly ener-
getic wave conditions after 27 October 2018, which is consistent with the sand accretion
for the same region in the topo-bathymetric survey conducted at the end of the experi-
ment (Figure 4.3c). The temporal evolution of the smoothed cross-shore profile transect
centered at alongshore distance = 700 m (Figure 4.7g) illustrates the temporal detach-
ment of the sandbar from the beach face creating a rip channel on 20-22/Oct/2018
(see standard deviation images for the same period in Figure 4.5). Overall, the cBathy-
derived cross-shore profiles transects (Figure 4.7h,i,j) are consistently below the sur-
veyed profiles with a positive bias of around 1 m depth.
   Similarly, Figure 4.8 shows PCA beach 2-day time-averaged vertical profile response
over time for three different alongshore transects depicted in Figure 4.8e,f,g. A sys-
tematic change in sea bed elevation is evident after 23 October 2018 with more sand
accumulation close to the reef’s alongshore-distance location (∼300 m). The temporal
evolution of the alongshore transect corresponding to the shallowest sub-tidal region
(Figure 4.8f) shows an overall bias with respect to the ground truth surveys that might
be related with non-linear effects resulting in depth overestimation.

4.9     cBathy error assessment

Following the approach proposed by Bouvier et al. (2020), a quality assessment was
computed for each of the non-filtered cBathy-derived bathymetries ĥ(xm , ym ) by count-
ing the number of points for which the cBathy algorithm returns a physical value (skill
higher than 0.5 with associated depth errors lower than 1 m). The quality assessment
(Qual) of video-derived bathymetries was assessed in percentage terms in relation to the
total number of grid points inside the camera viewfield delimited by values below the
zero-elevation contour line. In other words, the quality assessment counts how many
non-NaN depth estimates are retrieved from cBathy within the sampled area. Figure
4.9 shows the cBathy quality assessment for the 330 computed bathymetries according
to their corresponding tidal elevation and offshore significant wave heights (Hs ).




Figure 4.9 – Bathymetric inversion quality (Qual) as a function of tidal elevation (with
respect to MSL) and offshore significant wave height (Hs ).


   Tidal elevation has an influence on the quality of depth inversion with appreciable
errors associated to low tide stage. During low tide, waves break over the reef and
sandbar affecting the readability of the wave signature and resulting depth estimates.
Surprisingly, large waves (Hs > 2 m) do not appear to significantly reduce cBathy esti-
mations in the sampled area, as opposed to Bouvier et al. (2020) results. Nevertheless,
it is important to note that this quality assessment is based only on the total number of
individual depth outputs within the grid which performance at the end is given by the
same cBathy algorithm.

4.10      Discussion

Video-derived bathymetry estimations showed noticeable depth deviations modulated
by a diurnal signal dependent on the tide. As only half of the tide-period is captured
during daylight hours video-recording, depth deviations appear to fluctuate around a
diurnal cycle (rather than at the semi-diurnal tide) due to an aliasing effect. Tide-
dependent bias in cBathy depth estimation has been previously addressed by Bergsma
et al. (2016) as a consequence of the limited inclusion of tidal elevation in the code.
cBathy assumes fixed geographical pixel locations over the entire stack period. As de-
scribed by Bergsma et al. (2016), the pixel spatial footprint changes as the water level
rises and lowers with the tide. As the water level rises, pixels move towards the camera
contracting its size, while during a falling tide the opposite occurs, a relative expansion
of the pixel footprint is produced as the distance with the camera increases (see Figure
4.10). Incorrect pixels positions result in a shorter sensed wavelength than in reality at
low tide, leading to an overestimation of the wave number and thus an underestimation
of the depth, and vice versa for high tide. To overcome this issue, before cBathy com-
putation, we rectified all images within a ∼17 min stack by setting the reference level
(tidal elevation) according to the time of the middle image of the stack. Consequently
we updated the tidal elevation for every stack. The maximum horizontal shift as a per-
centage of the distance between pixel and camera system can be found with the ratio
T E/zcam where T E is the vertical tidal excursion and zcam is the vertical position of the
camera system. For the case of PCA beach, the camera height is 70 m and the tide varies
approximately 0.1 m during 8.5 min. Thus, a ratio of 0.14% is found to produce pixel
shift inaccuracies in the horizontal plane. This means that when the camera viewfield
reach a distance in the far end of the domain (around 900 m) the pixels move around
1.3 m back and forth within the ∼17 min duration of a stack. Therefore, we suspect
that this deviation in accuracy due to pixel shifting is not sufficient to induce signifi-
cant variations in depth after cBathy computations. However, vertical inaccuracies in
bathymetry estimates can become significant if, for example, a longer video recording
period is desired for a stack (>17 min) in an environment where tidal elevation varies
rapidly such as the present field study.

tidal elevation. The pixel set moves respectively towards the camera system and away
from it. At the same time, relative contraction and expansion between pixels take place.
Figure and caption extracted from Bergsma et al. (2016).


   In any case, the spurious tide-dependent depth-modulation seems likely to be related
with an inaccuracy on how the vertical fixed elevation is taken into account for the
pixel to ground coordinate transformation (subsection 3.3.4.5). An absolute error in
rectification (unreliability in the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters) obtaining the 11
transformation parameters can also lead to positioning errors. Therefore, these non-
physical sources of errors will require further investigation.

   The very upper part of the beach face is related with less accurate results as analysis
tiles can contain partly wet/dry pixels at the sea-land interface mixing unuseful sub-
aerial and acceptable subaqueous signals (Rutten et al., 2016). The systematic shallow
water bias (overestimation of true depth) can also be explained by finite amplitude ef-
fects that increase wave celerity as waves shoal and break reducing the validity of the
linear dispersion relationship (Bergsma and Almar, 2018; Brodie et al., 2018). Figure
4.11 illustrates an example of this case. Since the depth inversion estimation depends
upon accurate estimates of frequency and wave number pairs, we selected a stack (un-
der typical wave conditions at high tide) and compared the f − k pairs, estimated from

cBathy, with the linear dispersion relationship relative to the spectrum at the specific
depth and location given by the Aquadopp (AQ) current profiler installed within the
reef (see AQ position in Figure 2.7). As shown in Figure 4.11, the cBathy-derived wave
numbers according to the sea-swell frequency band are overall deviated from the linear
dispersion relationship. The straight line for the wave numbers is indicative of non-
linear interactions and that high-frequency components are bound or phase locked to
the wave group. Indeed, bound high harmonics contribute to an increase in skewness
and height of wave crests, which has for effect to enhance their propagation speed (Mar-
tins et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the overall mismatch between the cBathy-derived wave
numbers and the analytical linear dispersion relationship is too large to be attributed
solely to non-linear effects. As the cBathy computed wave numbers are smaller than the
predicted linear theory, when inverted, large depth overestimation are produced, up to
70% than the real water depth as shown for the case of the shallow water AQ location,
even though associated skill values (>0.5) indicate confident estimates. As mentioned
before, this large discrepancy in depth may be due to rectification errors although it
remains unclear.

   The current cBathy version does not include the effects of currents and Doppler
shifting in the dispersion relation (Eq. 4.1). For the case of PCA beach, persistent rip
currents (e.g., near the headland) can potentially interact with incident (short-period)
waves, shortening their wavelength (k increases) and thus underestimating local depth.
However, with cBathy typical settings (Table 4.2), short-period waves and rapid cross-
shore depth changes over the sample domain cannot be resolved, unless a denser pixel
spacing is defined and more (higher) frequencies are accounted for analysis (thus re-
quiring more computational effort) (Holman et al., 2013; Brodie et al., 2018). On the
other hand, several studies have reported significant variation in cBathy performance
with increasing wave height (Holman et al., 2013; Bergsma et al., 2016; Bouvier et al.,
2020), since breaking waves are spread over a wider surf zone, obscuring the optical
wave signal. Despite this issue, the quality assessment computed using Bouvier et al.
(2020) approach, indicates the capability of cBathy to return depth estimates for more
than 70% of the domain even under waves larger than 2 m. However, the fact that
depth outputs (with a skill score > 0.5) are still retrieved even under large wave condi-

tions does not necessarily mean that they are correctly estimated, as previously shown
in Figure 4.11.

to shore normal). The curve shows the linear dispersion relationship for the specified
water depth (4.29 m) given by the Aquadopp (AQ) during the same time. The markers
indicate the f − k pairs estimated from cBathy at the Aquadopp grid position. The color
of the markers is proportional to the skill used as a threshold quality control within
cBathy code; f − k pairs with a skill score below 0.5 are usually rejected for depth
inversion.




4.11      Conclusions

Video-based depth inversion through the linear dispersion relationship for free surface
waves using the cross spectral correlation analysis, cBathy (Holman et al., 2013) was
applied consecutively for 3-weeks in a highly energetic macro-tidal environment. The
comparison between surveys and cBathy estimates reveals an overall RMSE = 0.37 m
and bias = 0.57 m for the beginning of the experiment (05/Oct/2018), and a RMSE =
0.29 m and bias = 0.56 m over the whole domain by the end of the experiment (24-
26/Oct/2018). With exception of the rip channel formed by the end of the experiment,
the morphological features are in approximately the right places but with a significant
vertical offset (1−1.5 m) over the whole domain and enhanced at the shallowest parts
(reef and beach shore face) where depth is consistently overestimated. Application of

cBathy revealed two main issues: 1) inaccurate depth estimations dependent on the
tidal level and 2) less accurate depth estimates due to non-linear effects occurring in
shallow water regions. The first issue is most probably related with a rectification in-
accuracy and is currently under investigation. The second issue might be addressed by
incorporating non-linearity into the phase speed which requires additional knowledge
of the local wave height (Catálan and Haller, 2008). In conclusion, our results are in
agreement with Brodie et al. (2018) findings (the only study considering waves bigger
than 2 m), suggesting that bathymetric inversion should not be used to quantify mor-
phological evolution during storms, but rather when conditions are calmer at the time
of the rise or fall of each storm.

   The work behind this paper comprises a year of my PhD searching for a methodology
on how to estimate nearshore currents from consecutive video images. By the time we
started this research, we knew that the optical signature was always there; foam left by
breaking waves carried by the flow, as suggested by previous studies (e.g., Chickadel
et al. 2003; Almar et al. 2016). The challenge with respect to previous studies was
to find a method to track the two-dimensional foam displacement in the image plane
without tracking the influence of the passing waves. For this purpose, we built on Dérian
and Almar (2017) approach which consisted of tracking the foam trajectories using an
optical flow algorithm. Through trial and error and a lot of testings, we found a way
to filter out the wave signal from the image sequence in order to track the remnant
foam supposedly advected by the underlying currents. Nevertheless, it is important to
mention that during the period of writing this research article, Anderson et al. (2021)
simultaneously published a very similar article, which delayed the publication of our
manuscript as we had to restructure the content to put their work in context.
   Before introducing the article, a brief recompilation of different methods to estimate
surface velocities using remote sensing is provided.

5.2     Introduction

5.2.1    Surface currents estimation based on remote sensing tech-
         niques

The observation and monitoring of nearshore currents is an important task for coastal
protection, erosion control, flood mitigation, marine operations and beach safety (Novi
et al., 2020). However, direct measurements of currents in the nearshore are logistically
challenging and expensive. Remote sensing of the current field is typically achieved
using radar-based techniques (Streßer et al., 2017). Aircraft and satellite-based scat-
terometers, altimeters and synthetic aperture radars are able to scan large areas of the
ocean, however, the coarse spatial resolution, infrequent sampling and interference by
adjacent land areas limits the measurements to regions well seaward of the surf zone
(Perkovic, 2008). On the other hand, ground-based radars such as high-frequency (HF)
radars (3−30 MHz) and microwave (S-band: ∼3 GHz or X-band ∼10 GHz) marine
radars have shown to be very useful to measure surface currents over coastal areas
of different extension (Novi et al., 2020). HF systems reach larger offshore distances
(1.5−200 km; "over the horizon") at lower spatial resolutions (0.25−3 km), which lim-
its its utility inside the nearshore, whereas X-band systems achieve a smaller offshore
range (2−5 km; "line-of-sight"), but with a significantly higher spatial resolution (5−10
m) sufficient to resolve the dominant surface wave motions.
   HF radars measure ocean surface currents by calculating the Doppler shift of re-
turning energy that is Bragg scattered from surface gravity waves (Paduan and Graber,
1997; Kaplan et al., 2005). The difference between expected and observed Doppler
shift is used to calculate the radial surface current moving toward or away from the
radar station. Therefore, at least two HF radar stations are needed to combine these
radial currents to produce total surface current vectors.
   For X-band radars, currents are estimated based on their Doppler shifting from the
predicted dispersion relationship (Holman and Haller, 2013). As described by Young

frequency space is expected to lie on a shell defined by the dispersion relationship. Any
deviation from the analytical dispersion relationship is attributed to a current shifting
the wave frequency. Therefore, a least square curve fitting technique can be used to de-
termine the surface current required to account for the observed Doppler shift (Streßer
et al., 2017). The main limitation of this approach is that 3D-FFT methods maximize
spectral information at the expense of spatial resolution (Honegger et al., 2020). Thus,
the inherent limitation of spatial resolution make this method unsuitable for solving
currents within the surf zone (Holman and Haller, 2013).

   The use of video imagery to detect surface currents relies on tracking contrasting
features that are assumed to move from frame to frame with the flow velocity (Anderson
et al., 2021). In the surf zone, foam and bubbles generated by the breaking process
create contrast with the ambient water and provides a means to observe currents by
quantifying the passive advection of coherent features (Perkovic et al., 2009). However,
optical images also sense light reflections from sloped water surfaces and turbidity that
alters background color (Anderson et al., 2021). Thus, the challenge is to separate the
foam that is carried only by the flow from wave-breaking rollers that propagate at wave
celerity (Dérian and Almar, 2017).

   A few studies were dedicated to the estimation of surface currents along one di-
mension using timestack approaches (Chickadel et al., 2003; Almar et al., 2016). The
alongshore orientation allows to isolate the drifting foam motion and filter out breaking
waves that appear as horizontal streaks in the timestack. To estimate two-dimensional
surface velocities from optical imagery, most approaches rely on cross-correlation meth-
ods such as particle image velocimetry (PIV), borrowed from the fluid mechanics com-
munity (e.g., Adrian, 1991) or more recently on optical flow techniques, borrowed from
the computer vision community (e.g., Horn and Schunck, 1981). Both methods have
the capability to extract velocity vector fields from consecutive images and have been
used to estimate surface currents in the swash and surf zone (Holland et al., 2001;
Puleo et al., 2003; Perkovic et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2014; Dérian and Almar, 2017;
Anderson et al., 2021). However, none of the previous studies (with the exception of
Anderson et al. 2021) have addressed an approach to remove the dominant optical
clutter of incident waves from the image sequence to avoid capturing foam patterns

   Therefore, in this contribution, we propose a new approach to filter the dominant
optical signal associated with sea-swell waves from an image sequence. Moreover, we
explore the potential of computing two-dimensional wave-filtered surface currents by
tracking the residual drifting foam using an open-source optical flow algorithm.

5.3.1    Abstract

This paper examines the potential of an optical flow video-based technique to estimate
wave-filtered surface currents in the nearshore where wave-breaking induced foam is
present. This approach uses the drifting foam, left after the passage of breaking waves,
as a quasi-passive tracer and tracks it to estimate the surface water flow. The optical
signature associated with sea-swell waves is first removed from the image sequence to
avoid capturing propagating waves instead of the desired foam motion. Waves are re-
moved by applying a temporal Fourier low-pass filter to each pixel of the image. The
low-pass filtered images are then fed into an optical flow algorithm to estimate the foam
displacement and to produce mean velocity fields (i.e., wave-filtered surface currents).
We use one week of consecutive 1-Hz sampled frames collected during daylight hours
from a single fixed camera located at La Petite Chambre d’Amour beach (Anglet, SW
France) under high-energy conditions with significant wave height ranging 0.8 − 3.3 m.
Optical flow-computed velocities are compared against time-averaged in situ measure-
ments retrieved from one current profiler installed on a submerged reef. The computed
circulation patterns are also compared against surf-zone drifter trajectories under dif-
ferent field conditions. Optical flow time-averaged velocities show a good agreement
with current profiler measurements: coefficient of determination (r2 ) = 0.5 − 0.8; root
mean square error (RMSE) = 0.12 − 0.24 m/s; mean error (bias) = −0.09 to −0.17

offshore-directed velocities under persistent wave breaking across the reef, the optical
flow was able to correctly reproduce the mean flow patterns depicted by drifter trajecto-
ries. Such patterns include rip-cell circulation, dominant onshore-directed surface flow
and energetic longshore current. Our study suggests that open-source optical flow al-
gorithms are a promising technique for coastal imaging applications, particularly under
high-energy wave conditions when in situ instrument deployment can be challenging.


5.3.2    Introduction

Currents induced by wave breaking constitute the primary driving mechanism of sed-
iment transport and morphological change in the nearshore (Castelle et al., 2006).
Currents flowing along the shore (longshore currents) have the capacity to transport
hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of sand per year, reshaping the underlying
bathymetry and mobilizing nutrients, pollutants and biological species (Komar, 1998;
Chickadel et al., 2003). Wave action in the breaker zone induces a net transport of wa-
ter toward the shore, however, at certain locations along the coastline, the water returns
seawards through relatively narrows zones as rip currents (Inman, 2002). Rip currents
are concentrated fast-moving flows of water that extend from close to the shoreline
through the surf zone, sometimes beyond the breaking region (Castelle et al., 2016b).
These seaward-directed currents can pull swimmers offshore into deeper water making
them the leading cause of fatal drowning and lifeguard rescues on beaches worldwide
(Castelle et al., 2016a). Rip currents and associated surf-zone circulations are subject
to tidal and wave group modulation as well as to local bathymetry variations making
them highly variable in space and time, with flow pulsing within the infragravity (0.004
- 0.04 Hz) and very low frequency (VLF) band (<0.004 Hz) (MacMahan et al., 2006;
Castelle et al., 2010a). In this context, characterizing the nearshore circulation system
is crucial for efficient coastal infrastructure planning, reliable environmental assessment
and appropriate beach safety strategy.
   Traditional nearshore surf-zone velocity measurements are obtained by instruments
deployed in situ collecting Eulerian or Lagrangian data. Examples of these instruments
are electromagnetic current meters, acoustic sensors, and surface drifters (Rijn, 2007;

                                            87

Inch, 2014). Although these measuring techniques are robust and accurate, they are
usually limited to punctual measurements over short durations (Almar et al., 2016).
Moreover, the deployment and periodic maintaining of the instruments require a sig-
nificant amount of money, manpower and logistics resources (Streßer et al., 2017).
Overall, collecting Eulerian and particularly Lagrangian data in high-energy beach envi-
ronments is one of the greatest challenges (Castelle et al., 2016b). In order to overcome
these limitations, remote sensing provides an attractive alternative.

   Over the past decades, the use of low-cost shore-based video systems and more re-
cently camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enabled access to high-
resolution temporal and spatial data of the water surface layer (Holman et al., 2017;
Splinter et al., 2018b; Andriolo et al., 2019). A few approaches based on optical re-
mote sensing techniques have been developed to identify and characterize local surface
currents associated with specific frequency bands. Dispersion relation fitting techniques
(Young et al., 1985; Horstmann et al., 2017; Streßer et al., 2017) are one of such meth-
ods. Using the Doppler shifting of the surface gravity wave field, the surface velocity
vector is estimated from the difference between observed wave phase velocity and that
given by the linear dispersion relation (Horstmann et al., 2017). However, the use of the
linear wave dispersion in the nearshore region is questionable since non-linear effects in
wave hydrodynamics become significant (e.g., see Thornton and Guza, 1982). More-
over, the method requires a strong optical signature from the waves, which becomes
problematic in the surf zone due to the presence of foam and broken waves.

   Alternatively, the presence of foam have actually been exploited by optical tracking
algorithms to estimate the surface flow velocity and the propagation speed of (broken)
wave crests (Holland et al., 2001; Chickadel et al., 2003; Puleo et al., 2003; Almar
et al., 2016; Dérian and Almar, 2017; Anderson et al., 2021). In the case of low wind,
the remnant foam produced by breaking waves is assumed to act as a quasi-passive
tracer being advected only by the underlying currents as long as the passing waves are
removed. This assumption has been exploited to estimate mean longshore currents in
the surf zone along a transect of pixels parallel to the shore (Chickadel et al., 2003;
Almar et al., 2016).

   For extraction of the two-dimensional velocity field, perhaps the most common and

well-documented video-based technique is particle image velocimetry (PIV) (Adrian,
1991; Thielicke and Stamhuis, 2014). This method essentially splits the image into sev-
eral user-defined image segments or windows. The spatially-averaged displacement of a
cluster of particles inside each window is computed over time using a cross-correlation
approach. PIV-based techniques are typically performed in laboratory conditions using
particle images (fluids containing reflective and neutrally buoyant tracer particles) to
determine the velocity of the flow (Cox and Anderson, 2001; Kimmoun and Branger,
2007). Nevertheless, several studies have applied the PIV-based approach using shore-
based and UAV video footage to estimate bore celerities and surface currents in the
nearshore (surf zone and swash zone) (Puleo and Holland, 2000; Holland et al., 2001;
Puleo et al., 2003; Perkovic et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2014; Wilson and Berezhnoy,
2018; Chapman et al., 2019).

   An alternative video-based technique that estimates the velocity field between con-
secutive images are optical flow algorithms (Horn and Schunck, 1981). Dérian and
Almar (2017) presented a methodology based on an optical flow algorithm named "Ty-
phoon" capable to estimate instantaneous nearshore surface currents from image se-
quences. More recently, Anderson et al. (2021) presented a new technique for process-
ing surf-zone imagery called WAMFlow. Their approach consists of filtering the domi-
nant optical clutter of incident waves from an image sequence by averaging frames over
a sliding window in time with size of twice the dominant wave period. The resulting
wave-averaged movie (WAM) contains residual foam features which are tracked using
an optical flow algorithm to estimate the underlying mean flow motion inside the surf
zone.

   This paper builds on Anderson et al. (2021) similar wave-averaged approach. How-
ever, an alternative technique is proposed to remove the dominant wave optical signa-
ture present in the image sequence based on the use of a temporal Fourier low-pass
filter. The present paper aims to compare for the first time optical flow-derived ve-
locities against in situ velocity measurements from a fixed bottom-mounted Acoustic
Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). Optical flow estimates are also qualitatively compared
with Lagrangian drifters deployed at the southern end of Anglet beach (Basque Coast,
SW France) during an intensive field experiment carried out in October 2018 under

different wave, tide and wind conditions. Furthermore, this study provides some stan-
dard parameters for Liu (2017) MATLAB open-source optical flow program ("OpenOp-
ticalFlow") so that anyone can reproduce and estimate wave-filtered surface velocity
fields within the surf zone from consecutive images.
   This paper is organized as follows. A brief introduction of the optical flow algorithm,
as well as the physics-based equations, are detailed in section 5.3.3. The study site and
the field experiment, including all available instruments, are described in section 5.3.4.
The main processing steps before and after optical flow implementation are introduced
in section 5.3.5. Results, performance and limitations of the optical flow method are
presented in section 5.3.6 and further discussed in section 5.3.7 before conclusions are
drawn in section 5.3.8.


5.3.3    Optical flow algorithm

Optical flow can be described as the apparent motion of individuals pixels (i.e., bright-
ness patterns) between consecutive frames on the image plane (Horn and Schunck,
1981; Turaga et al., 2010). The present optical flow method is a differential approach
based on a global formulation with a smoothness constraint which is capable to esti-
mate the entire vector flow field simultaneously by solving a single equation (Dérian
and Almar, 2017; Liu, 2017). The estimated pixel displacement and the known time
interval between frames allow computing 2D velocity components within the entire im-
age domain. The underlying assumption is that the image intensity from one frame to
another remains invariant such that the time derivative of the image intensity can be
accurately evaluated (Liu et al., 2012). This holds under the hypothesis that the pixel
displacement is sufficiently small so that the pixel intensity remains constant (Horn and
Schunck, 1981).
   We used Liu (2017) MATLAB open-source optical flow program ("OpenOpticalFlow")
to extract high-resolution velocity fields from an image sequence containing continuous
patterns. The physical and mathematical foundations of Liu (2017) optical flow method
are well established and have been validated for various fluid flow visualizations using
laboratory, cloud and ocean images (Liu and Shen, 2008; Liu et al., 2012, 2015). The
physics-based optical flow equation in image coordinates is given by:

an inverse problem since it is one equation with two unknowns (u1 , u2 ). To determine
the optical flow, a variational formulation with a first-order smoothness constraint is
typically used (Horn and Schunck, 1981; Liu and Shen, 2008). Given I and f , we
define a functional:

   La Petite Chambre d’Amour (PCA) beach is the most southern stretch of the 4-km
long sandy embayment of Anglet beach located on the Basque Coast, SW France (Fig-

South and comprises a 90-m groin in the North. These two morphological characteris-

tics play an important role on the beach state and rip current location (Huguet et al.,
2016). Close to the headland, a 20-m wide submerged rocky reef is present exert-
ing persistent wave breaking and occasionally bathymetrically-controlled rips at low
tide under low-energy waves (Mouragues et al., 2020b). The beach is composed of
medium to coarse sand (D50 ≈ 2 mm) and is classified as a high-energy intermediate
beach with the presence of a double-bar (occasionally single-bar) system (Huguet et al.,
2016). The relative steep beach face (tan β ≈ 1/10) favors the formation of beach
cusps with shoreline dynamics strongly controlled by the geometry of the surf-zone
sandbar (Birrien et al., 2013). The coast is predominantly exposed to Atlantic W-NW
high-energy incoming swells with an average annual offshore significant wave height
Hs = 1.57 m (up to 10 m during winter storms) and average peak wave period Tp = 10
s (Abadie et al., 2005). The tide is semi-diurnal characterized by a meso-macro tidal
regime with an average range varying between 1.69 m (for neap tides) and 3.94 m (for
spring tides) (Rodriguez-Padilla et al., 2020). Breaking waves are the dominant driver
of nearshore currents, with tide elevation affecting breaking patterns and in turn mod-
ulating nearshore currents (Sous et al., 2020). As opposed to the northern Aquitaine
open sandy beaches, PCA beach responds predominantly at individual storm frequency
rather than at seasonal timescales (Huguet et al., 2016).


5.3.4.2   Field experiment

An intensive field campaign was performed at PCA beach from 3 to 26 October 2018
with the objective to investigate the nearshore current circulation and headland flows
under a range of energetic wave conditions (Mouragues et al., 2020a). The 3-week field
experiment involved a large display of instruments including four Acoustic Doppler Cur-
rent Profilers (ADCPs), six surf-zone drifters and high-frequency video monitoring from
a fixed video-camera and a camera-equipped UAV. In-situ directional wave and wind
measurements were also continuously collected (every 30 min and 1 hr, respectively)
by a permanent directional wave buoy located approximately 6 km offshore and by the
Biarritz airport meteorological station (71 m altitude) located 3 km SE of the study site,
respectively. Hourly water level measurements were retrieved from Saint-Jean-De-Luz
tide gauge located 15 km SW of the study site. In the frame of the large-scale field exper-

iment described in Mouragues et al. (2020b), the present dataset gathers the data col-
lected during the longest continuous fixed-camera video recording (08-15/Oct/2018)
together with simultaneous Eulerian measurements collected from a single available
ADCP installed over the submerged reef within the camera view field (Figure 5.1). The
field conditions during this week are shown in Figure 5.2 and are described in the
following subsection. In addition, the present study examines simultaneous video and
drifter data during four days (on 18, 19, 22 and 23 October 2018) under different wave,
wind and tide conditions (Table 5.1).


5.3.4.3   Field conditions and overall nearshore circulation

The 1-week (08-15/Oct/2018) continuous set of measurements used in this study (Fig-
ure 5.2) builds on the same experiment presented by Mouragues et al. (2020b). Over-
all, PCA beach was exposed to relatively energetic offshore wave conditions (average
Hs = 1.6 m) with high-energy wave events (Hs > 2 m) with peak wave period Tp rang-
ing from 7 to 15 s (Figure 5.2a,b). Offshore wave conditions also featured a wide range
of wave angle of incidence (−23 < θp < 20°; Figure 5.2c). The sign of the peak wave
incidence θp (angle of wave incidence relative to the shore normal) indicates on which
side of the headland waves were coming from. Wind conditions (Figure 5.2d,e) were
relatively weak with mean wind speed values around 3 m/s coming primarily from the
S-SE sector. A single moderate wind event was captured on 14 October 2018, reaching
wind speed up to 12 m/s coming from the W-NW (roughly shore normal) direction.
During the field experiment, PCA beach morphology corresponded to a low-tide terrace
beach state (Wright and Short (1984) classification) with a mostly alongshore-uniform
sandy bed that barely evolved throughout the experiment. The reader is referred to
Mouragues et al. (2020a,b) for more information about PCA bathymetry details.
   Mouragues et al. (2020b) classified wave-induced circulation patterns observed at
PCA into three wave angle of incidence configurations. According to this classification,
the 1-week dataset was identified as a deflection (θp > 0°; 8-10/Oct/2018), shore-
normal (θp = 0°; 11/Oct/2018) and shadowed (θp < 0°; 12-15/Oct/2018) configura-
tion. During deflection configuration (8-10/Oct/2018), the ADCP captured longshore
currents flowing toward the headland (Figure 5.2f). The seaward deflection of the

components. The gray filled area represents the water depth time series at the ADCP
location and the red line shows the temporal evolution of wave breaking water depth
(hbr ) defined as hbr = Hs /0.5. Non-shaded regions indicate video recording during

ration (11/Oct/2018) the surface flow was characterized by cross-shore motions with
surface velocities oscillating between -0.4 and 0.4 m/s. During the shadowed regime
(12-15/Oct/2018) surface currents were primarily onshore directed flowing away from
the headland driven by alongshore variations in wave breaking induced by the shad-
owing effect of the headland (Castelle et al., 2016b). Overall, surface currents were
found to be strongly modulated by the tide, which coincided with a spring tide cycle
with the water depth column varying from 1.5 to 5.9 m at the location of the ADCP
(gray shaded region in Figure 5.2f). As opposed to open sandy beach embayments, PCA
beach inherited geological features (headland and submerged reef) exert a strong con-
trol on nearshore circulation. A close inspection of the time evolution of wave breaking
water depth, defined as hbr = Hs /0.5 for PCA field site, indicates that the ADCP is within
the outer edge of the surf zone only around low tide for Hs < 2 m (red line in Figure
5.2f). Therefore, the submerged reef (where the ADCP is installed) is assumed to play a
major control in flow dynamics as waves start to break over the reef when water depth
decreases.




   In the frame of the drifter experiment described in Mouragues et al. (2020b), four
days of drifter deployments were selected to analyze PCA beach main circulation pat-
terns under different oblique wave configurations with varying wave, wind and tide
conditions (Table 5.1). In particular, during the rising neap low tide on 23 October
2018, a deflection rip was found to systematically advect drifters from the surf zone to
at least 1,000 m offshore. The spatial structure of the rip consisted of an approximately
150-m wide rip neck along the headland with a wider rip head extending further off-
shore the headland. Lagrangian and Eulerian measurements registered mean surface
velocities around 0.3 m/s in the rip neck and 0.35 m/s in the rip head along with VLF rip
pulsations with characteristic periods around 30 and 50 min (Mouragues et al., 2020b;
Sous et al., 2020).

5.3.4.4    Video data

High-frequency sampled images (1 Hz) recorded at 1624x1234 px were collected from
a single permanent camera video station installed on the top of Biarritz lighthouse (70
m above mean sea level) located near the tip of the headland (green star in Figure 5.1).
The resulting oblique images covered part of PCA near the headland, including the sub-
merged reef and the surf zone. Unfortunately, only one of the four ADCPs deployed
during the experiment was within the camera view field. In order to compare opti-
cal flow derived velocities against in-situ instruments, one week of continuous daylight
video recording corresponding to simultaneous ADCP measurements were selected from
08/Oct/2018−07:00:00 to 15/Oct/2018−15:30:00 GMT. Moreover, Lagrangian mea-
surements together with simultaneous video data were used to provide a spatial insight
of the surface flow. Drifter trajectories were captured by the video system on four dif-
ferent days. Between 2 and 3.5-h burst of images were selected from each day of drifter
deployment for further post-processing and analysis.


5.3.4.5    ADCP data

A single ADCP (Nortek Aquadopp Profiler 2 MHz) was deployed within the fixed camera
view field approximately 280 m away from the video station (Figure 5.1). This ADCP

was used to retrieve current measurements to further validate optical flow surface ve-
locities. The ADCP was mounted horizontally on an AquaCross aluminum frame (Figure
5.3) near the bottom of the submerged rocky reef between 1.5-5.9 m depth (depending
on the tide elevation). 1-Hz continuous measurements of pressure and velocities along
the water column were collected during 1 week (8-15 October 2018) for optical flow
comparison. The pressure sensor was located 0.2 m above the seabed (δs ). The velocity
profile was measured over vertical cells (zcell ) of 0.1 m size (δc = cell size) after a blank-
ing distance (δb ) of 0.1 m from the instrument. Velocity measurements were assigned
to the center of each cell starting with the bottom cell at 0.35 m (zcell1 = δs + δb + δc /2;
Figure 5.3) above the sand bed.

   Direct comparison of remotely sensed currents with fixed in situ instruments is not
a trivial task (Dérian and Almar, 2017; Anderson et al., 2021). Video-derived velocities
are extracted from the time-varying water surface layer which is locally influenced by
instantaneous wave and wind conditions. On the other hand, conventional ADCPs typ-
ically discard data from the upper region of the water column leading to an inevitable
spatial mismatch for a true velocity comparison. Upper cells emerge intermittently at
the passage of a wave trough restricting the analysis within the water column below this
elevation (Sous et al., 2020). To overcome this limitation, we make use of the concept
of σ-layers which will be described below.

   According to the shallowness parameter µ, the water surface at the location of the
ADCP was characterized by weakly dispersive waves propagating in shallow waters
(µ ≈ 0.12). The shallowness parameter µ is defined as:



                                         µ = (h0 k)2 ,                                   (5.6)


where h0 is the mean water depth and k the typical wave number (k ≈ 0.08 1/m).
The pressure was used to reconstruct the water surface elevation using Bonneton et al.
(2018) non-linear shallow water reconstruction formula, valid for weakly dispersive
waves propagating in the shoaling and surf zone (see (Mouragues et al., 2019; Martins
et al., 2020)):

water surface at different elevations of the water column. Velocities measurements at
these positions are obtained by interpolating the vertical cells’ velocity profile.

   For this study, the mean water depth h0 and the reconstructed water surface ζSN L
were computed consecutively over ∼17-min segments throughout the whole time series.
ADCP cells above the reconstructed water surface were discarded from the analysis and
submerged cells were depth-normalized. ADCP horizontal velocities along the water
column were transformed to a vertical σ coordinate system in order to measure the
velocities close to the water surface consistent with video-camera derived optical flow
estimation (see Figure 5.3). In addition, ADCP depth-averaged velocities were also com-
puted for comparison with optical flow estimates. The σ coordinate system is expressed
by a user-defined number of vertical layers m, hereafter referred to as σ-layers. Each σ-
layer j is normalized by the distance between the first ADCP cell and the instantaneous
water surface elevation:


               (j − 1) ∆z − zcell1                                   hSN L − zcell1
        σj =                       ;   j = 1, 2, 3, ..., m;   ∆z =                  .   (5.11)

   The first sigma layer (σ1 ) corresponding to the near-bottom is equal to zero and the
last sigma layer corresponding to the water surface (σm ) is equal to one. ADCP vertical
cells zcelli are interpolated to each σ-layer σj before normalization. Regardless of the
water depth, σ-layers are constrained to be equally divided along the water column so
their individual value in terms of sigma (between 0 and 1) remains constant, whereas
the thickness between σ-layers (∆z) in terms of meters is varying at each time step.
σ-layers coincide with the irregular water wave surface within the water column and
allow the calculation of residual velocity around the mean water surface level (Giddings

et al., 2014; Cheng, 2020). For the present study, 21 σ-layers were defined where each
layer corresponded to 5% of the instantaneous water column. Moreover, the three σ-
layers closest to the water surface were averaged (σ19 , σ20 and σ21 ) and are hereafter

were averaged and are hereafter referred to as the ADCP depth-averaged velocity mea-

5.3.4.6   Drifter data

Six GPS-tracked surf-zone drifters were released multiple times on four different days
(on 18, 19, 22 and 23 October 2018) with the purpose of providing greater spatial cov-
erage of rip cell circulation. Deployments lasted from 2 to 3.5 h (Table 5.1). Drifters
were individually seeded over the submerged reef region using a jet ski or by swim-
mers under reasonably safe conditions. Drifters’ positions logged at 2.5 Hz were locally
stored on an SD card and transmitted in real-time to a shore station for visualization
and retrieving strategy. The drifters were of a robust PVC design modified from that of
Schmidt et al. (2003) consisting of a subaerial mast containing the GPS antenna and
a submerged dampener (circular bottom plate) with external fins to reduce surfing ef-
fects and vertical motions (MacMahan et al., 2009). Drifters were provided by CMAR
(Coastal Marine Applied Research, coastal consultancy at the University of Plymouth)
which have been previously tested for the measurement of surf-zone flows (Austin et al.,
2013; McCarroll et al., 2014; Scott et al., 2016). According to Mouragues et al. (2020b),
drifter position and velocity uncertainties were estimated to be less than 3 m and ap-
proximately 0.1 m/s, respectively, with a maximum windage error of 0.1 m/s due to the
effects of wind slippage (Murray, 1975) during drifter deployment.

formation (Hartley and Zisserman, 2004) into a longshore/cross-shore local reference

frame with 1x1 m grid resolution. A direct linear transformation (Abdel-Aziz and
Karara, 1971) was used to generate the plan-view images considering 16 spatially
distributed surveyed ground control points (GCPs) on both land and water. To avoid
tide-related inaccuracies in image rectification (Bergsma et al., 2016), each image was
rectified onto a grid that was updated every 1-min in the vertical coordinate using inter-
polated water elevation measurements from a tide gauge located 15 km SW of the study
site. The intrinsic parameters of the camera (e.g., image center coordinates, effective
focal length and scale factors) were also taken into account to remove nonlinear effects
such as radial distortion in the images (Holland et al., 1997). Two different sub-image
domains were selected to reduce computational time when applying the optical flow
algorithm: a 100x100 m square domain centered at the ADCP image location for the
1-week continuous surface currents measurements (purple polygon in Figure 5.1) and
a 600x500 m domain for the drifter deployments (orange polygon in Figure 5.1).

   The approach of the present study is to use the drifting foam, left after the passage
of breaking waves, as a quasi-passive tracer and track it to estimate the water surface
flow. When using optical flow over consecutive images, the main challenge is to avoid
capturing the foam (or any water pixel parcel) moving at wave celerity. As shown in
Figure 5.4, the visible sea-swell wave signature can be removed by applying a temporal
Fourier low-pass filter on a pixel-by-pixel basis to the whole image sequence. This is
an accurate alternative to remove waves in the frequency domain instead of applying
a moving-average over consecutive frames as proposed by Anderson et al. (2021).
Figure 5.4a shows a raw rectified frame containing readily visible alongshore patterns
of propagating waves while Figure 5.4b shows the same frame after wave-filtering all
pixels over time using a low-pass filter with cutoff-frequency fc of 1/20 Hz. Figure
5.4c presents the pixel intensity power spectral density (PSD) computed at the image
location of the ADCP (purple and orange dot) using raw and low-pass filtered images.
The PSD computed from the raw image time series (purple line) contains the swell
and wind sea wave signal centered at frequencies around 1/13.4 Hz and 1/6.6 Hz,
respectively. This is in agreement with the average offshore peak wave period (Tp = 12
s) previously shown in Figure 5.2b. The low-pass filter cutoff-frequency fc should
be selected preferably below the lowest peak wave frequency fp of the entire record,

to ensure that no wave-train is leaked into the image sequence and tracked by the
optical flow algorithm. However, it is important to note that the selection of the
cutoff-frequency fc also regulates the degree of image smoothing.          Maintaining a
sufficient amount of texture (i.e., pixel intensity variations) in the image allows the
optical flow algorithm to track fine-scale foam patterns. Thus, a trade-off between
separating the optical wave signal and keeping the texture from the image should be
considered. During the field experiment, the lowest peak wave frequency registered
by the offshore buoy was fp = 1/15 Hz (see Figure 5.2b). For this study, raw images
were low-pass filtered using two different cutoff-frequencies: fc = 1/20 Hz (as shown
in Figure 5.4b,c) and fc = 1/60 Hz. These two different set of low-pass filtered
image sequences will be used as input for the optical flow algorithm to estimate two
independent set of wave-filtered surface currents hereafter referred to as OF (fc = 1/20
Hz) and OF (fc = 1/60 Hz). Confronting the optical flow estimates using two sets of
cutoff frequency will help understand the effect of the selection of fc on the results.

5.3.5.2   Implementation and assessment


The optical flow algorithm was applied consecutively to more than 257,000 frames
(71.5 h) in an area of 100x100 m at an image resolution of 1 m/px. The optical flow
estimated surface velocities were spatially interpolated to the ADCP image location and
compared against the instrument upper layer σ-velocities (average between σ19 , σ20
and σ21 ) and depth-averaged velocities. Surface velocity time series and PSDs were
computed from both, optical flow estimates and ADCP measurements for a qualitative
comparison. Optical flow and ADCP velocity values corresponding to the time when the

ADCP was outside the surf zone (hADCP > hbr ) were identified and excluded from the
analysis to ensure the presence of foam and reduce optical flow near-zero velocities.
Consequently, the 1-week daylight dataset was reduced by 53% of the original dataset
to approximately 137,000 images (38 h). The PSDs of 1-week surface velocity time se-
ries were computed using Welch’s method with 17 Hann-windowed non-overlapping
records of 2 hours (approximately two segments per day). Similarly, the squared-
coherence between ADCP and optical flow-derived velocities was estimated from the
corresponding 1-week surface velocity time series using the same procedure. This re-
sulted in each spectral estimate having 34 degrees of freedom and a spectral resolution
of 0.00014 Hz.
   5-min time-averaged optical flow and ADCP velocities associated with different
ranges of significant wave height Hs were compared in order to assess the optical flow
performance under different wave height conditions. Moreover, optical flow and ADCP
velocities were averaged over a sliding window in time in order to reduce random noise.
Different window sizes, ranging from 1 to 30 min, were selected for the moving aver-
age computation. For each window size selected, the resulting estimated and measured
time-averaged velocities were quantitatively compared. Performance statistics, compris-
ing the coefficient of determination (r2 ), the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean
error (bias) and the linear regression slope were computed to assess the optical flow
ability to reproduce in situ measurements.

Figure 5.5 shows the 5-min time-averaged surface velocity components time series cor-
responding to 1-week of daylight measurements. For the longshore surface velocity
component (Figure 5.5a), the optical flow derived-velocities recreate fairly well the slow
fluctuations found in ADCP surface measurements. However, northward-directed cur-
rents (positive longshore velocity values) appear to be slightly underestimated. Regard-
ing the cross-shore component (Figure 5.5b), onshore-directed currents overall match
well between optical flow and ADCP, while offshore-directed velocities are less in agree-

ment. This underestimation will be discussed in section 5.3.7. In general, the optical
flow velocities obtained using low-pass filtered images with fc = 1/20 Hz and fc = 1/60
Hz are similar in pattern. However, OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) present a smaller amplitude (i.e.,
smaller velocities values) with respect to OF (fc = 1/20 Hz). It is important to note that
near-zero optical flow values correspond to the time of high tide water elevation with
Hs < 2 m when no wave breaking was present over the reef and no foam was available
for tracking close to the ADCP location (see Figure 5.2f; blue shaded regions in Figure
5.5).

   Figure 5.6 shows the 5-min time-averaged ADCP and optical flow surface velocity
components of Figure 5.5 as a comparison under different ranges of significant wave
height Hs . Surface velocities were grouped into seven Hs bins of 0.5-m size. The
corresponding statistics for each bin are summarized in Table 5.2 and 5.3 and depicted
with histograms of different colors in Figure 5.6. Around 80% of the velocity data
is concentrated between 1 and 2.5 m of Hs . OF (fc = 1/20 Hz) and ADCP surface
velocities within this range show a relatively good agreement (r2 ≈ 0.5 and RMSE ≈ 0.2
m/s). However, the bias and the skewed bivariate histograms indicate a northward- and
offshore-directed current underestimation that becomes more evident for Hs > 2.5 m
(bias ≈ 0.2 m/s).
   Comparison between OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) and ADCP surface velocities shows a smaller
bias and less dispersion of the data with respect to OF (fc = 1/20 Hz). Although r2 sug-
gests a similar linear agreement (r2 ≈ 0.5), optical flow velocities are overall smeared
as shown in the histograms of Figure 5.6c,d. This is also evidenced by the steeper values
of the regression slope (slope > 2).

using low-pass filtered images with fc = 1/60 Hz as input. Comparison between OF
(fc = 1/60 Hz) and ADCP surface velocities, for a window size larger than 10 min,

show r2 values ranging from 0.55 up to 0.65 with associated RMSE between 0.12 and
0.11 m/s. Similarly, OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) vs. ADCP depth-averaged velocities exhibit
r2 ranging from 0.5 up to 0.6 with lower RMSE between 0.10 and 0.08 m/s. A fair
performance is still found when using low-pass filtered images with fc = 1/20 Hz. OF
(fc = 1/20 Hz) vs. ADCP longshore velocity measurements (surface and depth-averaged
velocities) show a consistent agreement (r2 = 0.5) for any window size larger than 5
min, although RMSE values are relatively lower when compared against ADCP depth-
averaged velocities (RMSE between 0.12 and 0.13) than with surface velocities (RMSE
between 0.13 and 0.14). By contrast, ADCP cross-shore surface and depth-averaged
velocities are better correlated with OF (fc = 1/20 Hz) than with OF (fc = 1/60 Hz)
velocity estimates. For a window size larger than 5 min, r2 values vary between 0.7-
0.8 and 0.5-0.7, respectively (Figure 5.7b). OF (fc = 1/20 Hz) vs. ADCP cross-shore

velocity RMSE decreases from 0.21 to 0.19 m/s as the window size increases from 5 to
30 min regardless if the optical flow estimates are compared against surface or depth-
averaged ADCP velocities. On the other hand, as the window size increases from 5 to
30 min, OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) vs. ADCP cross-shore surface velocity RMSE decreases from
0.13 to 0.12 m/s and OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) vs. ADCP cross-shore depth-averaged velocity
RMSE decreases from 0.11 to 0.08 m/s. In addition to r2 and RMSE metrics, it is worth
noting the values of the linear regression slope for both velocity components (Figure
5.7e,f). Slope values equal to one indicate a correct steepness for the one-to-one linear
relationship between optical flow estimates and ADCP measurements. According to the
regression slope, OF (fc = 1/20) velocity estimates indeed reproduce better the ADCP
measurements for both velocity components with slope values around 1 ± 0.15. Overall,
as the window size is increased, high-frequency noise-related variability (i.e., RMSE) is
reduced improving performance metrics (Figure 5.7c,d).
   The bias has been intentionally omitted in Figure 5.7 as it poorly depends on the
time-averaging window size. Regardless of the window size selection for the moving-
average, the bias remain constant and correspond to the same values previously shown
in Figure 5.6 and Table 5.2 and 5.3: OF (fc = 1/20 Hz) vs. ADCP longshore velocity
bias = −0.09 m/s, OF (fc = 1/20 Hz) vs. ADCP cross-shore velocity bias = −0.17 m/s,
OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) vs. ADCP longshore velocity bias = 0.01 m/s and OF (fc = 1/20 Hz)
vs. ADCP cross-shore velocity bias = −0.05 m/s. Moreover, the bias does not appear to
change with ADCP surface or depth-averaged velocity measurements.

   Figure 5.8 shows the surface velocity PSDs computed over the 17-averaged 2-h
segments 1-week time series. The PSDs reveal a variety of signals present in both ADCP
and optical flow time series (e.g., infragravity and VLF fluctuations). As expected,
the velocity spectral energy associated with the sea-swell frequency band, previously
removed from the image sequence, is subsequently attenuated for frequencies higher
than the image low-pass filter cutoff-frequency (fc = 1/20 Hz and fc = 1/60 Hz; black
dashed lines). The squared coherence is significant at the 95% confidence level in
the infragravity frequency range (0.004 - 0.04 Hz) with values around 0.4 for the
cross-shore velocity component. Nevertheless, the frequency region with the highest
coherence (≈ 0.6) is associated with the VLF band (<0.004 Hz). Overall, the squared
coherence shows a better agreement for OF (fc = 1/20 Hz) velocities. The low spectral
energy found in OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) estimates is related to the low amplitude found in
the surface velocity time series.

show evidence of primarily onshore-directed flows. Intermittent traces of foam along
the headland made it possible to compute mean optical flow estimates outside the surf
zone, although velocities in this region may not be reliable due to a lower number of

observations (Anderson et al., 2021). This is the main reason why only qualitatively
streamlines are shown to represent the mean surface flow.
   More complex circulations are described by the drifters on 22 October 2018 (Figure
5.9e,f). The presence of a quasi-steady circulation cell at the location of the reef is
displayed under a combination of moderate-energy and shore-normal incident waves
(Hs = 1 m; Tp = 11 s; θp = 0°) around low tide. It is interesting to note the evolution of
rip channels inside the surf zone which in turn influences the circulation. Nevertheless,
optical flow estimation of the circulation patterns is consistent with the observed drifter
tracks. Figure 5.9g presents the trajectories of the first set of drifters released around
neap low tide on 23 October 2018, whereas Figure 5.9i shows the trajectories of the
remaining drifters deployed during rising low tide. During low tide (Figure 5.9g,h), the
wave-induced longshore current is deflected against the headland and affected by wave
breaking across the reef resulting in a transient counter-clockwise circulation cell and a
deflection rip. As the water level increases (Figure 5.9i,j), the reef exerts less control on
rip dynamics allowing the dominant longshore current to completely deflect offshore
resulting in a fully-developed deflection rip.
   Movies were generated for the four days of drifter deployments and are provided as
Supplementary Material (Video S1, Video S2, Video S3 and Video S4). The movies con-
tain the 2-min time-averaged optical flow velocity field overlapped with drifter trajecto-
ries. Overall, optical flow is able to recreate satisfactorily the main circulation patterns
described by drifters trajectories reproducing smaller circulation structures with a great
spatial resolution. Moreover, results are in agreement with previous studies describing
the same events (Mouragues et al., 2020b; Sous et al., 2020).

5.3.7.1   Comparison to other optical flow-based methods


In the context of coastal imagery, the shortcomings of the PIV approach and cross-
correlation based methods, is that the estimated velocity field resolution is dependent
on the size of the user-defined image segments (i.e., one displacement vector per image
segment or window) being sparser than the input image resolution (Dérian and Almar,
2017). PIV is also prone to errors under conditions of insufficient surface texture, lim-
iting it to spatially small areas (Puleo et al., 2003). On the other hand, the optical flow
method is capable to provide a velocity vector at every pixel of the image. Despite the
high potential of this technique, coastal applications are scarce (Philip and Pang, 2016;
Dérian and Almar, 2017; Anderson et al., 2021) in contrast with PIV studies (Puleo and
Holland, 2000; Holland et al., 2001; Puleo et al., 2003; Perkovic et al., 2009; Wilson
et al., 2014; Wilson and Berezhnoy, 2018; Chapman et al., 2019).

   Table 5.4 summarizes the performance of existing optical flow-based techniques pre-
viously reported in the literature (Dérian and Almar, 2017; Anderson et al., 2021) for
estimating two-dimensional nearshore surface currents. The velocity outcomes pro-
vided by each method are compared with measurements from specific in situ instru-
ments deployed under different field conditions at particular sites. The main difference
between the three methods relies in the pre-processing of the images before the op-
tical flow is applied. In Dérian and Almar (2017) method, a two-dimensional spatial
high-pass median filter is applied to each image in order to enhance the foam texture.
While this filter improves the fine-scale foam patterns from large-scale structures such
as propagating wave rollers, it does not remove the optical wave signal from the images.
Their method has the potential to compute instantaneous (wave-by-wave fluctuations)
surface velocities, however, the optical flow algorithm is also subject to track pixels
propagating at wave celerity and disregard the actual flow. By contrast, Anderson et al.
(2021) and the present method filter the wave signal from the image sequence in order
to track coherent foam patterns carried by the time-averaged flow, thus constraining the
computed surface velocities below the sea-swell frequency band.

against near-bottom velocities collected from a single Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter
(ADV) deployed within the swash zone. As the authors recognized, the comparison
between optical flow estimates and instrument measurements was limited by their dif-
ferent location of the vertical profile. Despite drifter measurements acquired during the
same field experiment were available (Castelle et al., 2014a; Scott et al., 2018), they
were not considered in their analysis. On the other hand, Anderson et al. (2021) com-
pared optical flow derived-velocities against surf-zone drifters velocities using 15x15 m
spatial bins. As mentioned by Anderson et al. (2021), drifters were often subject to
surfing effects from localized wave-breaking such that they experienced motions at the
scale of wave-by-wave fluctuations suggesting that in situ drifter might be unreliable
tools for estimating mean currents at the scale of wave groups.

5.3.7.2        Low-pass filter cutoff-frequency selection

The optical flow algorithm is very sensitive to the image input and the selection of the
cutoff-frequency for the temporal low-pass filter can have a great impact on the final
velocity estimates. OF (fc = 1/60 Hz) velocity estimates presented lower velocities and
less spectral energy than ADCP measurements. For the temporal low-pass filter, using a
cutoff-frequency of 1/60 Hz is equivalent to averaging images consecutively over 1 min.
By proceeding with this selection, the dominant sea-swell band is evidently removed

                                                                       117

from the image sequence, however, all residual foam features become smeared and
over-smoothed resulting in lower and underestimated velocity values (see histograms
in Figure 5.6c,d). Furthermore, time-averaging these values can result in velocities close
to zero with still a good linear correspondence to ADCP measurements with low RMSE
and low bias. This can lead to a misinterpretation of good performance, as shown by
the regression slope (Figure 5.6c,d and Figure 5.7e,f) and the damped velocity time
series (Figure 5.5). By contrast, OF (fc = 1/20 Hz) velocity estimates demonstrate
satisfactory agreement with surf-zone drifters tracks and ADCP measurements under
relatively high-energy waves (Hs < 2.5 m). Velocity RMSE of less than 0.25 m/s is a
reasonably satisfactory result considering that the spatial resolution of the image grid
is 1 m and the pixel footprint at the ADCP location is 0.6 m. On the other hand, the
apparent bias and overall underestimation in offshore-directed currents (overestimation
in onshore-directed currents) can be explained by other sources of error (see subsection
5.3.7.4).


5.3.7.3     ADCP measurements: surface vs. depth-averaged velocities

Directly comparing remote sensing products with in situ instruments is complicated.
Optical flow estimates are representative of the motions occurring in the water surface
layer, whereas, in the case of the ADCP, velocities corresponding to the upper region of
the water column are usually removed to avoid possible errors associated with sidelobe
interference, bubble injection, Stokes drift and wind contamination. Thus, it is difficult
to evaluate "true" errors as velocities are compared from different locations of the ver-
tical profile. However, for this particular study, the fact that r2 and RMSE do not differ
as much when compared against ADCP surface or depth-averaged velocities suggests
that the vertical variability of the flow is nearly depth-uniform. Figure 5.10 illustrates
three representative 2-h time-averaged velocity profiles in σ coordinates. The velocity
profiles were computed under different angles of wave incidence at low tide (around 2
and 3 m of water depth). The three configurations indicate shallow water flows with
no significant vertical gradient, consistent with previous observations around the ADCP
location (Sous et al., 2020; Mouragues et al., 2020b). These results show evidence of
a nearly depth-uniform flow, however, for other locations inside the surf zone the vi-

sual surface layer might not always be representative of the entire water column. In
case of strong vertical shear, the proposed ADCP transformation to σ coordinates can be
an alternative to derive velocities near the water surface consistent with video-derived
estimates. However, caution must be exercised given the inherent limitations of the
instrument when measuring close to the free surface.

current directed away from the headland) and cross-shore (V > 0; offshore-directed
current) velocity components are shown in purple and orange colors, respectively.




5.3.7.4   Sources of error

It should be noted that optical flow struggled to reproduce offshore-directed velocities
at the ADCP location as revealed in the cross-shore velocity time series (Figure 5.5b) and
the one-to-one comparison (Figure 5.6b). This can be mainly attributed to wave break-
ing. Although the frequency band corresponding to sea-swell waves is removed from the
images, the source of foam, induced by wave breaking, appears as a blob that increases

                                           119


            CHAPTER 5. OPTICALLY DERIVED WAVE-FILTERED SURFACE CURRENTS


and spreads with time in the onshore direction following the filtered pre-existing wave
front. Figure 5.11 illustrates the instantaneous circulation flow under wave breaking
at two different instants separated by 7 s. In this representative example, ADCP veloc-
ities indicate a depth-uniform offshore-directed flow (as previously suggested). A close
inspection of the optical flow velocity field near the ADCP location (Figure 5.11a,c) re-
veals instead a transient clockwise circulation cell which after 7 s (Figure 5.11b,d) is
modified to be aligned with the incoming filtered wave front moving toward the shore.
This effect is also observed with the isolated foam blob advancing around coordinates
with alongshore distance = 410 m and cross-shore distance = 350 m (green polygon).
However, this issue occurs in any region where strong wave breaking is present (e.g.,
reef and sandbar) and is also observed with low-pass filtered images with fc = 1/60 Hz.
This suggests that the optical flow can erroneously track foam patches at the instant of
their creation potentially masking true underlying velocities at those times. Therefore, a
proper definition for the f (x1 , x2 , I) term inside the physics-based optical flow equation
(Eq. 5.1) is needed in order to account for specific foam properties such as source and
dissipation rates, or alternatively, remove the velocity estimates associated with pixels
that break in post-processing (Anderson et al., 2021).
   Surface velocity accuracy can also be limited by windage effects. Ideally, foam is
expected to be advected only by the underlying currents, however, under high wind
conditions, wind stress can induce surface currents that can advect the foam in a dif-
ferent direction than the desired surface/near-surface water flow. This could be prob-
ably the case during the relatively strong wind event on 14 October 2018, when wind
speed reached up to 12 m/s. Other video-related sources of errors such as unwanted
camera movement (e.g., produced by wind) (Bouvier et al., 2019; Rodriguez-Padilla
et al., 2020), overlapping camera boundaries and tide dependent inaccuracies in geo-
rectification (Bergsma et al., 2016) may also affect the performance of the optical flow-
based technique and should be properly addressed before the optical flow method is
applied.

5.3.7.5   Recommendations and future work

Optical flow is a powerful technique, however, certain factors and limitations must be
considered in order to obtain satisfactory results. The first assumption, inherent to
any optical flow algorithm, is that the pixel intensity between two consecutive frames
should be nearly constant. Therefore, it is preferable to correct the scene illumination
(e.g., by histogram equalization) before applying the optical flow method to increase
accuracy. As described in Appendix A, we used a subroutine included in Liu (2017)

                                          121


           CHAPTER 5. OPTICALLY DERIVED WAVE-FILTERED SURFACE CURRENTS


OpenOpticalFlow algorithm to correct the local illumination intensity changes between
frames. Brightness variations can also be constrained to small changes if a coarse-to-
fine scheme is used (see Appendix A) or if frames are sampled at a high rate (>1 Hz).
However, this can have a direct impact on storage resources. An alternative to overcome
this issue, as proposed by Anderson et al. (2021), is to downsample the number of
frames (e.g., by a factor of 5) once the dominant optical sea-swell wave signal is filtered
from the image sequence, and then further apply the optical flow algorithm. Image
temporal downsampling is possible after removing the wave clutter since the residual
foam is smoothed in such a way that brightness variations between consecutive frames
are kept low. However, filtering the optical signature from the images is a key step that
must not be overlooked.



   As shown in Figure 5.5, it is important to discard velocity values associated with pix-
els outside the surf zone or regions where no foam is present, otherwise, the optical flow
algorithm will assign velocity values close to zero and underestimate the actual surface
flow. For the ADCP pixel location we deduced the time when the instrument was in-
side the surf zone based on the water depth and kept only those corresponding velocity
values. On the other hand, for the drifter experiments we removed all time-averaged
velocities smaller than 0.02 m/s to ensure that the remaining velocities (streamlines)
corresponded to regions where foam was present (e.g., surf zone). Future work should
include a post-processing step, similar to the one proposed by Anderson et al. (2021),
to automatically identify and isolate foam regions based on a local pixel brightness vari-
ation threshold between frames in order to discard spurious velocities when there is
limited texture on the water surface to track.



   It should be noted that the intermittent wave breaking region where the ADCP was
deployed was a particularly challenging location for the optical flow algorithm to pro-
duce accurate velocity estimations. Therefore, we propose that further research should
be undertaken by mounting current profilers distributed at different locations within the
surf zone to provide the optical flow algorithm the optimal conditions for a consistent
comparison.

5.3.8    Conclusions

In this paper, we presented an alternative method to filter the dominant optical signal
associated with sea-swell waves from an image sequence. Waves were removed from
the image time series by applying a temporal Fourier low-pass filter to each pixel of the
image. After image-wave-filtering, the residual foam left by wave breaking was used
as a quasi-passive tracer and was assumed to be advected primarily by the underlying
flow; wind conditions during the experiment were relatively weak with mean wind
speed values around 3 m/s.      Foam trajectories within the surf zone were tracked
using Liu (2017) open-source optical flow algorithm ("OpenOpticalFlow") to derive
wave-filtered surface velocities (comprising frequencies below 1/20 Hz and 1/60 Hz).
We proposed an approach based on depth-normalization of the water profile (σ-layers)
to retrieve surface velocities from ADCP measurements. A transformation of z to σ
coordinates ensures that the velocities derived from the ACDP are as consistent as
possible with those estimated from the optical flow algorithm. Optical flow-derived
velocities were compared with ADCP time-averaged surface and depth-averaged veloc-
ities. ADCP measurements displayed nearly depth-uniform time-averaged velocities.
Time-averaged optical flow velocity estimates, using low-pass filtered images with
fc = 1/20 Hz as input, showed to be in good agreement with ADCP measurements
(r2 = 0.5 − 0.8; RMSE = 0.12 − 0.24 m/s; bias = −0.09 to −0.17 m/s; slope = 1 ± 0.15;
coherence2 = 0.4 − 0.6). By contrast, optical flow-derived velocities, using low-pass
filtered images with fc = 1/60 Hz as input, were overall underestimated due to an
over-smooth of the foam features. In any case, optical flow offshore-directed velocities
were systematically underestimated. This outcome can be justified by waves breaking
over the reef (i.e., ADCP location) that produce and advect foam persistently toward
the shore. The onshore-directed motion of the foam, induced by wave breaking, can
differ from the actual underlying flow and can inadvertently be captured by the optical
flow algorithm. Despite this apparent limitation, optical flow was able to qualitatively
reproduce with a good agreement the mean current circulation patterns described
by drifter trajectories under different wave, tide and wind conditions. Among these
patterns, a rip-circulation cell was captured as well as a prominent and persistent
rip current flowing against the headland (deflection rip). Such findings highlight the

ability to detect rip currents and associated circulations at different time-averaging

5.4     Implications and potential of optically derived
        wave-filtered surface currents

The nearshore is difficult to study comprehensively using only in situ data as a large
number of instruments are required to adequately sample the time and spatial scales
associated with nearshore circulation (10 s−1000s meters) (Perkovic et al., 2009). As
stated by MacMahan et al. (2010), comprehensive kinematic fluid characteristics of the
surf zone motions is hindered by the lack of synoptically observed flow fields. For these
reasons, the optical current meter technique presented in this work has the potential
for providing new insight into fundamental surf zone dynamics not obtainable with
previous in situ measurements or remote sensing products.
   The ability to continuously quantify surf zone circulation patterns over a large area
using a simple low-cost video system has the potential to reveal variability on time scales
ranging from tidal level changes (a few hours) to beach state progressions occurring on
the order of weeks to seasons. To our knowledge, there are no other observational ap-
proaches that can map surf-zone (wave-filtered) surface currents on comparable spatial
and temporal scales.
   An illustrative example of the ability to capture short-term temporal variability is
provided in Figure 5.12, where estimated wave-filtered surface velocities were averaged
over 20 minutes for low tide and high tide on 22 October 2018 under shore-normal in-
cident waves. At low tide (Figure 5.12a), the intensity of wave breaking on the sandbar
became amplified, more foam was generated, the surf zone became wider (100 m)
and the swash zone contained less energy. This hydrodynamic and morphodynamic
configuration enabled complex circulation patterns. The mean vorticity field was com-
puted following (MacMahan et al., 2010) to highlight the positive vorticity associated
with the counter-clockwise rip circulation cell (at the location of the reef) and the eddy

formed inside the rip channel (Figure 5.12b). By contrast, at high tide (Figure 5.12c),
the surf zone width decreased (50 m) with intermittent breaking on the sandbar and a
swash zone noticeable in the timex and pixel intensity standard deviation image (Fig-
ure 5.12c,d). Variability (standard deviation) ellipses show the mean surface velocities
along with their temporal variability at high tide.

which are induced by an obliquely incident wave field. Figure 5.13 shows the potential
in estimating the longshore current structure from video. Intensity and cross-shore ex-
tent of the longshore current can be analyzed to understand the hydro/morphodynamic
factors that control and modulate the current patterns. Optical flow-derived velocities
may also be useful to study very low frequency motions (<0.004 Hz) such as shear
waves, a type of motion in the surf zone associated with longshore current instabilities
(Bowen and Holman, 1989; Oltman-Shay et al., 1989). On the other hand, time series
analysis techniques, such as harmonic analysis can be applied to individual pixel grid
locations to separate the tidal constituents from other fluctuations in order to estimate
tidal currents in coastal environments such as tidal inlets or estuary mouths.

6.1     General conclusions

This work primarily focused on the development and implementation of optical remote
sensing techniques to study nearshore morphodynamic and hydrodynamic processes
under high energy wave conditions in a meso-macro tidal environment. A side objec-
tive was to assess the extent to which remote sensing techniques could provide reliable
data under harsh field conditions and propose new processing approaches to guarantee
an optimal accuracy in the final video-derived product. The data used in this thesis
builds (mainly) upon the comprehensive 3-week field experiment carried out on Octo-
ber 2018 in one of Anglet beaches (SW France), La Petite Chambre d’Amour, where I
had the opportunity to participate and collaborate with researchers from other institu-
tions such as from the University of Plymouth and Université Pau et Pays de l’Adour.
In this final chapter, the general results are summarized and concluding remarks are

briefly discussed. Finally, the results are placed in perspective and future investigation
is proposed.


6.1.1    Image stabilization

We developed an efficient semi-automatic procedure to stabilize an image sequence us-
ing state-of-the-art techniques in order to remove unwanted camera movement after
video acquisition. We investigated the impact of camera viewing angle deviation when
monitoring the nearshore. Our results show that camera movements occur on a wide
range of timescales and induce large geo-rectification errors at the fixed video monitor-
ing station of Anglet, which is often the case but is disregarded for many other video
stations worldwide. One primary problem with existing stabilization methods is that
they are sensitive to changes in brightness and contrast making them prone to failure.
This method provides a robust solution to stabilize an either continuous or sub-sampled
image sequence under varying illumination with the ability to process large databases.
   The image stabilization method required the presence and identification of differ-
ent land-sub-image regions containing static recognizable features (referred to as key-
points), such as corners or salient points. Keypoints were matched against themselves
after computing their two-dimensional displacement with respect to a reference frame.
The vertical (tilt) and horizontal (azimuthal) pixel displacement was obtained using
a cross-correlation algorithm with sub-pixel accuracy (Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2008a)
together with a Canny edge detection filter (Canny, 1986). Pairs of keypoints were af-
terwards used as control points to fit a geometric transformation in order to align the
whole frame with the reference image. The stabilization method was applied to 5 years
of daily images collected from a three-camera permanent video system located at An-
glet Beach, 70 m above mean sea level. Azimuth, tilt and roll deviations with respect to
the initial frame were computed for each camera. In addition, 2.5 km of shoreline were
manually digitized for the outstanding winter period of 2013/2014 using non-stabilized
and stabilized rectified images to estimate the real-world horizontal positioning error
due to camera movement.
   The three cameras presented motion during all the time series and showed a par-
ticular annual signal in azimuth and tilt deviation. This can potentially be attributed

to the sun position and thermal expansion fluctuations. Camera movement amplitude
reached approximately 10 pixels in azimuth, 30 pixels in tilt and 0.4° in roll, together
with a quasi-steady counter-clockwise trend over the 5 year time series period. More-
over, camera viewing angle deviations were found to induce large rectification errors up
to 400 m at a distance of 2.5 km from the camera. The mean shoreline apparent posi-
tion was also affected by an approximately 10-20 m bias during the 2013/2014 winter
period.


6.1.2     Nearshore bathymetric mapping from video imagery

For three consecutive weeks we estimated bathymetry maps every 30 min during day-
light hours using a video-based linear depth inversion algorithm cBathy (Holman et al.,
2013) to examine PCA beach morphological response under a wide range of wave
(Hs = 0.5 − 3.3 m; Tp = 6 − 15 s) and tide (∼4 m) conditions. The assessment was car-
ried out by comparing concurrent video-derived bathymetries with in situ topo- bathy-
metric measurements collected during the beginning and end of the field experiment.
Comparisons between surveyed and video-derived bathymetric estimates showed a sim-
ilar performance with respect to previous studies (Brodie et al., 2018) with an overall
RMSE = 0.29−0.37 m and bias = 0.56−0.57 m. However, the temporal evolution
of estimated bathymetries revealed large discrepancies in depth (a systematic overes-
timation in depth fluctuating between 1 and 1.5 m over the whole domain). The sea
bed was found to vary instantaneously with the tide, which is non-physical. We sus-
pect that the tide-dependent depth inconsistency is attributed to a rectification issue
that will require further investigation. Meanwhile, the error seems to be closely re-
lated to the (varying) reference level at which the oblique image is projected, which
in case of inaccuracy, could potentially induce positioning errors and mistakenly feed
the cBathy algorithm. To overcome this problem, we filtered out the spurious high-
frequency depth-modulation signal to keep only the slow-varying (>2 days) changes in
depth.
   The smoothed bathymetry time evolution showed the transition from a Low Tide
Terrace (LTT) to a Transverse Bar and Rip (TBR) beach state according to Wright and
Short (1984) classification. During the beginning of the field experiment, the sandy bed

morphology was reasonably uniform alongshore showing a terrace bar attached to the
shore with a slight central crest located around 250 m in the cross-shore. Comparison
between surveys revealed the formation of an alonghore uniform sandbar centered at
cross-shore position = 300 m with a net deposition of sand (around 1-m of accretion)
within the reef region. This result is consistent with the gradual accumulation of sand
registered in the video-derived bathymetry estimates during the end of the experiment,
when an energetic wave event (waves up to 3 m high) occurred. As shown in the bathy-
metric surveys, the sand accretion is suspected to be driven by onshore sediment trans-
port, as all the region outside the surf zone (beyond the camera domain) eroded during
the course of the experiment. Furthermore, change in wave and tidal regime induced
the formation of a rip channel incising the sandbar, resulting in increased neashore
alongshore variability. .
   Overall, cBathy-derived bathymetries were consistently overestimated with respect
to the surveys (and ADCP water depth measurements) with larger differences for the
upper part of the beach and the shallow region around the reef. As we encountered
a systematic tide-dependent bias, probably originated from a rectification inaccuracy,
it is difficult to assess the extent to which the vertical offset may be caused by nonlin-
ear effects and wave-current interactions reducing the validity of the linear dispersion
relation on which cBathy is based.


6.1.3    Optically derived wave-filtered surface currents

We explored the potential of computing 2-D wave-filtered surface currents from video
images by tracking the drifting foam, left after the passage of breaking waves, using an
open-source optical flow algorithm (Liu, 2017). This algorithm looks for nearby pixels
of the same brightness intensity assuming small motion between frames. The optical
flow algorithm relies on a global formulation with a smoothness constraint which is
capable to provide a velocity vector at every pixel of the image resolving the entire flow
simultaneously.
   We proposed a new approach, based on a Fourier Low-pass filter, to remove the
dominant optical signal associated with sea-swell waves from an image sequence to
avoid tracking propagating waves instead of the desired foam assumed to be advected

only by the flow. For the first time, we compared optical flow-derived velocities with in
situ current profiler measurements under high-energy wave conditions (Hs = 0.8 − 3.3
m) during one week of simultaneous measurements. In addition, we validated opti-
cal flow-derived circulation patterns with surf-zone drifter trajectories under different
field conditions. Our results show that the optical flow method is capable to repro-
duce mean surface velocities below the sea-swell frequency band with a fair agreement
(r2 = 0.5−0.8; RMSE= 0.12−0.24 m/s) and is able to capture time-averaged circulation
structures inside the surf zone with a great spatial resolution.
   PCA beach inherited geological features (headland and submerged reef) exert a
strong control on nearshore circulation. At low tide, under shore-normal waves, the
submerged reef plays a mayor control in flow dynamics inducing cross-shore motions
and a rip cell circulation as waves start to break over the reef. On the other hand,
obliquely incident waves result either in a shadowed or deflection configuration de-
pending on which side of the headland waves are coming from. During shadowed
configuration, surface currents are primarily onshore directed flowing away from the
headland driven by alongshore variations in wave breaking induced by the shadowing
effect of the headland. By contrast, during deflection configuration, the longshore cur-
rent is deflected against the headland resulting in a strong seaward flow extending well
beyond the surf zone. These three main circulation regimes, previously described for the
same experiment in Mouragues et al. (2020a,b) using drifter measurements and a small
number of current profilers, were recreated fairly well by the optical flow time-averaged
surface velocity estimations.




6.2     Research perspectives

Many research groups worldwide use video monitoring systems to remotely sense
nearshore hydrodynamics and morphodynamics. Remote sensors are less invasive, are
easier to deploy and maintain, and offer wider areal coverage than typical arrays of in
situ instruments (Perkovic et al., 2009). The increasingly proliferation of low-cost and
flexible new platforms such as UAVs, swift cameras, CoastSnap (Harley et al., 2018),
etc., offers an attractive option to collect image products and derive measurements of

                                           131

the nearshore. Whether it is with fixed video station or camera-equipped UAV, the im-
age processing techniques should, in principle, be transferable and compatible between
platforms. As a demonstration, Figure 6.1 shows the image stabilization method pro-
posed in this thesis applied to an UAV flight in order to remove the unwanted movement
of a random frame. Overall, we observe that there is a satisfactory performance of the
method.

(c) unstabilized image and (d) stabilized image. The colored crosses are the user-
defined static keypoints with respect to the reference image, whereas the circles indicate
their shifted position.


   Further work could be to use the UAV data collected during Anglet field experiment
to examine the offshore part of the deflection rip which was systemically outside from
the fixed camera view field. This could help to further understand the structure of such
rips as they detach offshore from the headland. However, this is only possible if enough
foam is advected by the deflection rip so it can be tracked by the optical flow algorithm.
   Optical flow video-based technique has the potential to provide unprecedented in-
sight into surf zone hydrodynamic processes at scales that were previously difficult to
reach. As we applied the optical flow-based method to an optical video camera, sur-
face velocities can only be estimated during daylight hours. However, infrared video

                                                        6.2. RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES


cameras are not constrained by this limitation. The same optical flow method can be
applied to infrared imagery to track the remnant foam (which is typically cooler than
the surface water and/or recently generated foam; Wilson et al. 2014) at any time ei-
ther daylight or nightlight hours. This could also be the case for X-band radar imagery
if enough sea-clutter is available for tracking.
   Video-derived surface currents can provide critical contextual data for both theoreti-
cal and applied nearshore studies. From the perspective of hazard to recreational beach
users, identification and awareness of rip currents are essential for coastal and beach
safety (Castelle et al., 2016b). In this sense, the optical current meter enables to moni-
tor both the average and transient circulation, such as flash rips, for which the location
of occurrence is random. The rapid development of webcams and UAVs together with
the recent growing body of machine learning recognition algorithms offer the possibil-
ity to provide quantitative information at a reasonable instrumental and computational
cost (Dérian and Almar, 2017). Operational use of this optical flow-based current meter
using low-cost image platforms combined with open-source computer vision algorithms
to automatically detect rip currents could provide crucial near-real time safety messages
to beach users before entering the water.
   To sum up, in this thesis we proved that nearshore remote sensing is a promising and
still ongoing discipline with the capability to link observations with specific geophysical
quantities. This study opens new perspectives to routinely improve camera geometry of
video monitoring systems and to further derive higher quality remotely sensed hydro-
dynamic and morphological products. Furthermore, this work opens up new avenues
for frequently monitoring rip currents and associated circulations, which is critical for
scientific interests and beach safety strategy. We therefore think that our findings will
impact the coastal community and our methods will be used by many research groups
worldwide.

A    Optical flow algorithm setup

The relevant parameters used for Liu (2017) OpenOpticalFlow algorithm are listed in
Table A.1.


    As previously mentioned in subsection 5.3.3, OpenOpticalFlow uses the Horn-
Schunck estimator for an initial solution and the Liu-Shen estimator for a refined so-
lution of Eq. 5.3. The term f (x1 , x2 , I) depends on a specific flow visualization. For
a transport of a scalar (i.e. foam concentration), it is related to the molecular diffu-
sion plus the boundary term. For simplicity, we defined f (x1 , x2 , I) = 0, a reasonable
approximation for most fluid mechanics problems where the convection is dominant
as shown in Liu and Shen (2008); Liu (2017). The Lagrange multipliers "lambda_1"
and "lambda_2" (λ in Eq. 5.5 and 5.3) are selected for the Horn-Schunck and Liu-Shen
estimators, respectively. The Lagrange multipliers act like a diffusion coefficient in the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations (Eq. 5.3 and 5.5) and tend to smooth out finer
flow structures (Liu et al., 2012, 2015; Liu, 2017). There is no rigorous theory for
determining the Lagrange multiplier in the variational formulation of the optical flow
equation. Within a considerable range of the Lagrange multipliers, the solution is not

   The pixel displacement between frames should be small (typically less than 5 px
depending on the size of image patterns (Liu, 2017)). Otherwise, the time derivative
of the image intensity will be underestimated in the finite difference method and the
optical flow error would be significant (Liu et al., 2012). To handle large displacements
(e.g., >10 px), a coarse-to-fine iterative scheme is adopted to improve the accuracy
of optical flow computation (Liu, 2017). First, the raw images are downsampled by a
suitable scale factor (parameter called "scale_im") using the wavelet transform (Dérian
and Almar, 2017) so that the displacements in pixels remain small enough (1-5 px).
Next, the optical flow algorithm is applied to the downsampled images to estimate a
coarse-grained velocity field. Finally, the original resolution velocity field is recovered
by iterations (parameter called "no_iteration") using an image-shifting (image-warping)
algorithm with an embedded spatial interpolation scheme (Liu et al., 2015). Usually,
one or two iterations are sufficient (Liu, 2017). In addition to the main program, (Liu,
2017) OpenOpticalFlow include two image pre-processing routines (Gaussian filters)
for removing small random noise and correcting the effect of local illumination intensity
change. The mask size of the Gaussian filter is given by the parameter called "size_filter"
and the standard deviation of the Gaussian filter is 0.6 of the mask size. The standard
deviation (or size) of the Gaussian filter is given by the parameter called "size_average"
in the program. A full description of the parameters and subroutines involved in the
usage of OpenOpticalFlow can be found in (Liu, 2017).




   For this study, the Lagrange multipliers in the Horn-Schunck and Liu-Shen estimators
were set at 20 and 2000, respectively. In the coarse-to-fine scheme, raw images were
initially downsampled by 2 (reduced to 50% of their original size) and then refined to
their original resolution by the first iteration. The mask sizes of the Gaussian filter for
removing small random noise was set to 4 px in the raw images, while the standard
deviation of the Gaussian filter was set at 60% of the mask size. The mask size of the
filter for correcting the effect of the changing illumination intensity was fixed at 30 px
for the raw images (Table A.1).
