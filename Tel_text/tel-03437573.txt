                                     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


       Becoming a doctor in a scientific field was my dream when I was a child. However, I could not
imagine to study and obtain a Ph.D. as well as to enjoy my life in France. That is the reason why I
would like to acknowledge someone who helps me to make my dream come true.

       First and foremost, I would like to thank my parents, for financing all of my studies since I
was a child and never stop believing in me. Raising a child like me was probably never easy and they
were so patient, encourage to push me, step by step. I would like to express my gratitude to my
sister and her family who often live with my parents when I have studied in France and shared with
me the worst moment in this period.

       To start my journey in France, I would like to express my appreciation to Prof Marc LEMAIRE
– my supervisor, who gave me the course in Green Chemistry and provided me a prestige chance to
work in his lab. During this time, I really admired his energy, knowledge and attitude and I hope I
would have a chance to collaborate with him in my future career.

       Additionally, I would like to thank to two ‘’wonder woman’’ in my lab: Dr Estelle METAY and
‘’mama’’ Marie-Christine DUCLOS. Estelle, I really appreciate all your help as my supervisor in master
intership. Although you «gave me up » after this period, you always accompanied me in the lab, gave
me any advice when I needed and shared with me almost the key movement in your house. Marie,
my PhD life would have been more difficult without your help. Although your English is quite limited,
you always attempt to understand me and help me not only in the lab but also in our badminton
club. Playing this sport every Monday or Tuesday was really useful to remove my stress from my
experimental section.

       Next, I am grateful to my jury members, Dr Raquel P. HERRERA, Pr Véronique NARDELLO-
RATAJ, Pr Abderrahmane AMGOUNE, Dr Andreas J. VORHOLT, Dr Jérôme LE NÔTRE. In particular, I
would like to give my special thanks to Dr HERRERA from Spain and Dr VORHOLT from Germany for
kindly accepting to act as the reviewers of my PhD manuscripts and to spend a few days in Lyon for
my PhD defense.

       I would like to thank the S.A.S PIVERT for funding my PhD project-WP3P21-BIOALDEHYDES. In
particular, I want to thank Dr Jérôme LE NÔTRE and Mrs. Cécile ARMIEL to help me in all of the
official tasks in this project and invited me to PIVERT seminars every year that were very useful and
helped me broaden my knowledge in this field. I would also thank our collaborators in the
BIOALDEHYDES project, Benoît BRIOU, Dr Vincent LAPINTE, Pr Jean-Jacques ROBIN and Dr Sylvain
CAILLOL in the Institute Charles Gerhardt in Montpellier. They are so greatful, help me in every
meeting and suggest me a new idea to valorize my project. I also want to thank Dr Claire NEGRELL in


Institute Charles Gerhardt Montpellier to make all TGA analysis of our thiazolium salts and give us
valuable information to select the best catalysts

        Then, I would like to thank all of my colleages in group CASYEN-ML to share with me a lot of
interesting moments during this period. Firstly, I would like to thank Dr Boris GUICHERET, who was
my mentor during my master intership and was the best colleague in my PhD’s time. I really
appreciate him for the help at the beginning in the lab and also in France. The summer vacation with
him was very impressive to me, although he failed to teach swimming. I also want to thank my best
roomate, the fromage-lover, best ping-pong player I have ever known, Dr Aurelien HERBINSKI. Two
years with him was easy, especially when he left me alone with my party at the weekend. I also
appreciated him for his help when we went together in the congress and shared the craziest
moments in La Rochelle 2017. Next, I also thank my first French colloc, 25 or “Valentine” CINQUIN.
Although staying together in a short time but his friendship is always warm when we see each others
and « Bon courage with Bonnie ». I want to thank Biwen ZHU, the Chinese student in our group, who
often made 1-2 columns per day and stayed with me almost the late time in the lab. Congratulations
to B1 and hope she find a job in food chemistry, a field that could combine two of her big interests:
Food and Chemistry.

        Next, I want to thank Elsa DERUER and Souleymann BAH, my labmates as well as the pioneers
in my project. I really appreciated your work during my master internship, which gave me a lot of
inspiration to start my PhD thesis. I would like to thank my first trainee during my PhD period, Aubin
CHARVIEUX. Thank you for your useful work in my project as well as interesting discussions whenever
we had a seminar in our group. I also thank my other intership students: Romain ‘’Rambo’’
CHAVALLARD, Yassine ERRAFI and Kevin GROLLIER, who will continue on the scientific road (Romain,
Kevin) or follow other interesting pathway (Yassine) but I hope they could be happy with their
chosen. I also want to thank Dr Julien SOFACK-KREUTZER to be a member of our interesting office
and to have a lot of jokes with me and Romain. I am also grateful to the newcomers in the lab who
just passed the honey-moon in the PhD period, Mélissa LANDART and Thomas DE DIOS MIGUEL. I
hope they will be lucky enough to fullfil their targets. I also want to send my thankness to all the
former members in CASYEN-ML team such as Dr Eric DA SILVA, Dr Dorine BELMESSIERI, Dr Bilal
ELASAAD, Rim MOUSELMANI, Laura TO’O TO’O, Louis LE MOIGNE, Flavien DELARBRE, Clément
GHIAZZA, Hanieh ROUEINDEJI to stay together in the group and gave me a lot of help during PhD
time.

        I want to thank all of my colleagues in ICBMS for their friendship. In particular, I want to
thank the NMR Center (Dr Anne BAUDOUIN, Emmanuel CHEFDEVILLE, Christophe GILBERT) and the
Mass Spectrometry Center (Christian DUCHAMP, Alexandra BERLIOZ-BARBIER, Antoine VAUCHEZ) for
their analysis of a thousand samples in my PhD.

        I would like to thank my girlfriend, Thy PHAM who helped me to design some figures in my
manuscripts. Especially, I would thank her to stay with me in the most difficult year of my PhD life.


Other thanks are also sent to my Vietnamese friends who often played sport, drank together and
shared their experiences with every weekend.

        Finally, I would like to keep THE BEST FOR THE LAST. I really want to thank the MOST
IMPORTANT PERSON in my PhD life, Dr Nicolas DUGUET, my co-supervisor of my PhD thesis. Let me
go somewhere when I needed a rest, shared with me all his best knowledge in this field and
accompanied in most of the scientific congresses, Nicolas made my PhD more comfortable.
Moreover, he spent much time (even during many naps of his son), red pens and his patience to
correct my manuscript. Furthermore, a lot of useful skills I have learnt from him during 4 years such
as the writing skill, a communication technique and a management of scientific projects. « If
someone present in your life, he/she should play a role » and I think Nicolas also completely played a
critical role in my PhD life. « Merci, Chief » for all of that!

        “Make our planet great again” is an action message, not only from the French government
but also from all the leaders over the world. But, anyone has a question surrounding their mind such
as “Why we need to make it great again?”? Herein, we have an explanation for that question. In fact,
the climate change caused many negative effects for our planet such as global warming, a rise of sea
level or the decrease of biodiversity. This phenomenon could be explained by the the growth of
world’s population, leading to a rapid increase of global demand of energy and materials. To deal
with these issues, the use of renewable resources such as biomass which is abundant, cheap and
with a low carbon emission, has become more important. Moreover, biomass can be produced in a
sufficient volume for industrial purposes without compromising the human food supply. For
example, the use of biomass represented 11% of total raw materials in German chemical industry in
2003 (Figure 1).1 Although carbon-based products are mainly produced from crude oil but both crude
oil and gas are not renewable resources and need a long-term process for their formations.
Otherwise, the use of biomass is also a carbon neutral process because carbon dioxide (a major
contributor of climate changes) could be captured during the growth of biomass through
photosynthesis. Thus, sooner or later, biomass will replace fossil materials as a major feedstock for
chemical production.

        In 1998, Paul Anastas and John Warner published a set of principles toward more sustainable
approaches in Chemistry.2 One of the key concepts in the frame of Green chemistry is use of
renewable feedstocks in chemical production. For example, cellulose and hemicellulose are
considered as a source of carbohydrates and phenolic derivatives could be released through
depolymerization of lignin. Besides them, vegetable oils are also one of the most abundant chemical
building blocks in nature. The main components of vegetable oils are triglyceride (a triester of
glycerol and fatty acid) then vegetable oils could be converted to a variety of chemical platforms,
from short chain (acetaldehyde, ethanol, lactic acid, etc) to long chain substrates (biodiesel,
oligomers). Because of the potential applications of vegetable oils, “Picardie Innovation Végétales,
Enseignements et Recherches Technologiques” (P.I.V.E.R.T) was created in 2011, within the frame of

French Institute for the Energy Transition and was selected as an investment for the future. The main
target of this framework is to create a biorefinery from vegetable oil and the valorization of all plants.
In fact, at the beginning, proteins and bio-diesel were the most valuable products from vegetable
oils. However, a political rule was recently proposed by the French goverment and is limiting the
application of biodiesel.3 In order to valorize vegetable oils, they should be converted to other value-
added products such as surfactants, polymers and chemists have much to contribute to solve these
challenges.

        Nowadays, the use of renewable resources has become a great interest in industrial
chemistry because it could reduce the addiction on fossil materials and decrease the emission of
greenhouse gases. In this context, vegetable oils and animal fats are promising renewable feedstocks
that are cheap and widely available. In 2009, the world’s production of vegetable oils accounted for
137 million tons (Mt) and increased to 185 Mt in 2016 (an increase of 35%). 4-5 Among them, the four
most produced oils are Palm oil, Soybean oil, Rapeseed oil and Sunflower oil that represent 87% of
the global production. The remaining oils consist of a variety of plant oils such as Olive oil, Linseed oil,
Castor oil, Cotton seed oil, etc.

        There are two major consumptions of plant oils and animal fats. On the one hand, the use of
vegetable oils for culinary purpose represents approximately 80% of the global production. On the
other hand, 20% of the world’s production is currently used for industrial applications (Scheme 2).
For instance, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) that are produced from the transesterification of
vegetable oils, are considered as bio-fuels for transports.6 In 2017, the global production of bio-diesel
was forecasted to approximately 34.5 billion liters with a cheap price, estimately around 75 euros per
hectalitre.7 Among them, 19.9 billion liters are produced from developed countries and 14.5 billion
liters are obtained from developing countries with the two biggest producers of the palm oil diesel
from Malaysia and Indonesia.

        Vegetable oil derivatives could be also used for the preparation of polymers or surfactants,
e.g castor oil that is consisting in at least 85% of ricinoleic acid, could be used as polyols in the
production of polyurethane foaming.8 Lauric acid, that is a major fatty acid of coconut oil, is used in
the production of ionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate. Other important intermediates of
plant oils are epoxidized vegetable oils. Firstly, they can be used directly as stabilizers in the
production of PVC or as plasticizers for other plastics. Secondly, they could be functionalized to other

interesting chemical platforms such as diols for the synthesis of polyurethanes, diacyl substrates for
bio-lubricants, cyclic carbonates for the bio-based solvents or non-isocyanate polyurethanes, etc.9,10
Glycerol that is a co-product of the transesterification of plant oils, is also an interesting chemical
platform in fine chemistry.11 It should be noted that the production of each 10 kg of biodiesel via
transesterification process yields approximately 1 kg of crude glycerol. Firstly, glycerol is directly used
as an important excipient in the formulation of medicine or as humectants and moisteners in many
skin and hair care products. Secondly, it could be easily converted to other useful substrates.
Historically, trinitroglycerin was employed in the production of propellants. Later, this derivative was
also used as a potent vasodilator to treat heart conditions such as angina pectoris and chronic heart
failure. Moreover, glycerol is considered as key bio-based feedstock for the synthesis of 1,2-
propanediol, acrolein, glycerol carbonate and glycerol ethers that have a variety of applications in the
preparation of polyurethanes or bio-surfactants.11,12,13

         Aldehydes are important chemicals in organic synthesis, due to their wide applications in
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and herbicides. Moreover, they can be converted to value-added
compounds such as surfactants, polymers, etc. Traditionally, aldehydes are mainly obtained through
oxo-process by hydroformylation of olefins or reductive ozonolysis of alkenes.14 Next to them, the
reduction of fatty acids or the dehydrogenation of primary alcohols were used in several cases to
prepare some aldehydes.14 However, both methods suffer from their drawbacks such as the price of

catalyst or the requirement of special equipment. Consequently, the development of greener
approaches for the production of aldehydes is highly desirable. The project WP3P21-BIOALDEHYDES
was financed by PIVERT in 2015 through GENESYS programme for the cleavage of vegetable oil
derivative to prepare aldehydes and to valorize these products in polymer. This work was carried out
in collaboration between Institute Chemistry, Biochemistry and Supramolecular Chemistry (team
CASYEN) and Institute Charles Gerhardt Montpellier (team IAM) from 2015 to 2018.

       In this manuscript, our work will be presented in 5 chapters:

       Chapter 1: An overview of the literature on vegetable oils will be given, including the
important chemical transformations of vegetable oil as well as the use of organocatalysts to convert
these materials.

       Chapter 2 and 3: A first method to approach bio-aldehydes is presented. Two homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalytic metal-based methods to prepare fatty D-hydroxyketones from
oleochemical 1,2-diols have been described. Then, the cleavage of these fatty substrates has been
studied, through organocatalyst. Moreover, the valorization of aldehydes was also investigated
through a Stetter reactive to give bifunctional derivatives that could be used as monomers.

       Chapter 4: The cleavage of fatty diketones is studied by organocatalysis to give the two
corresponding esters which could also serve as monomers.

       Chapter 5: A second method to obtain aldehydes from fatty substrates has been described
through a two-step synthesis. The first step is a nucleophilic addition of H2O2 on fatty epoxide to
provide fatty E-hydroxy hydroperoxide and the second one involves the decomposion of this species
under thermal conditions.

       Then, a general conclusion will be given to summarize all the results of this thesis and several
perspectives will be proposed for future work.

       Finally, experimental data will be presented in the last section of this manuscript, including
all the experimental procedures and NMR characterizations of all products.

1. Vegetable Oils- Structure, composition
          Vegetable oils (VO or triglycerides) are a combination of glycerol and three moieties of
    (un)saturated fatty acids that have between 12 and 22 carbons in the fatty chain with 0 to 5
    double(s) bond(s) per fatty acid. Among them, there are some common fatty acids that are
    usually encountered in plant oils (Scheme 2).

2. Functionalization of vegetable oils
        There are plenty of transformations of vegetable oils that could convert triglycerides to
  valuable compounds. For example, the reaction on the carbonyl group could provide a series of
  interesting bio-based platforms bearing different functional groups such as alcohols, amines,
  amides or nitriles. The reaction on the hydrocarbon chain could also give another family of value-
  added substrates. However, in this context, we would like to focus on some transformations of
  interest that are the most studied such as epoxidation (plasticizers), dihydroxylation
  (hyperbranched polyester), ozonolysis (fatty acids/aldehydes) or metathesis (polyamides). All of
  these functionalizations are focused on the unsaturated vegetable oil derivatives and the method
  described will be presented on vegetable oils but they could be also applied to fatty acids or
  esters, using oleic moiety as a model unsaturated fatty derivative.

   2.1 Epoxidation
        Epoxidized vegetable oils are one of the major functionalized derivatives of triglycerides due
   to their wide variety of applications such as plasticizers, lubricants, paints and dyes formulation.
   Furthermore, they are considered as an interesting intermediate for preparation of value-added
   compounds such as diols, cyclic carbonates, monoketone derivatives, etc. In 2013, the industrial

       production of epoxidized vegetable oils reached about 200,000 metric tons.15 Herein, the main
       methods for preparation of epoxidized triglycerides will be summarized and several perspectives
       will be presented.

          2.1.1 Homogeneous catalytic systems
                There are a lot of methods described for the synthesis of oleochemical epoxides from
          unsaturated vegetable oils. One of the most efficient pathways is to use peracids as oxidants.
          However, almost all peracids are not really stable. That is the reason why a mixture of H2O2
          and an organic acid is generally used to generate in situ the peracid. Indeed, this process
          includes three steps: i) in situ formation of the peracid by oxidation of the acid in the presence
          of hydrogen peroxide and transfer of the peracid from aqueous phase to organic phase; ii)
          oxidation of the olefin derivative to epoxide by the peracid then, iii) re-oxidization of the acid
          to the peracid. Furthermore, a catalytic amount of strong inorganic acids (H2SO4, HCl, H3PO4 or
          HNO3) could be neccessary to increase the kinetics of formation of the peracid. The reaction is
          often performed at moderate temperature (40-60°C for HCOOH or 60-80°C for CH3COOH) and
          usually requires an excess of hydrogen peroxide. It should be noted that hydrogen peroxide is
          considered as a green, cheap and efficient oxidant16 because it has the highest content of
          active oxygen of all common oxidants (Table 1) and only water is a co-product.

                According to Lewandowski et al, the epoxidation of rapeseed oil was carried out using an
         homogeneous system AcOH/H2O2 in the presence of small amount of H2SO4. The reaction was
         performed at 65°C for 6 hours and provided the desired products with 66% yield. 17 In the
         literature, several organic acids were also used such as HCOOH, CH3COOH and benzoic acid.
         However, considering the cost and the work-up, performic and peracetic acids were usually
         prefered for preparation of the epoxidized vegetable oils (EVO). A comparision of the
         efficiency of different acids showed that performic acid is the most suitable reagent for this
         transformation.18 For example, an excellent yield (99%) was achieved when soybean oil was
         epoxidized by a mixture of H2O2/HCOOH in the presence of Amberlyst at 60°C for 2 hours
         (Scheme 3).

                The activation energy for epoxidation process of fatty acid derivatives was also
         determined. The value of the activation energy for peroxoacetic acid (54.7 ± 2.1 kJ/mol) is
         higher than that for peroxoformic acid (35.9 ± 5.2 kJ/mol), indicating that the epoxidation with
         performic acid is easier than with peracetic acid. However, these conventional epoxidation
         methods suffer from several disadvantages. Firstly, a series of side reactions could be
         produced, especially through ring-opening of oxiranes, leading to a decrease of the yield of the
         desired products, (Scheme 4). Secondly, the epoxidation is a highly exothermic reaction. It
         could present a risk when the reaction is performed in the presence of corrosive agents such
         hydrogen peroxide and peracid. Thirdly, the use of a catalytic amount of inorganic acids
         (except solid Lewis acids) in particular sulfuric acid, generates a large amount of non-recyclable
         wastes.

                    A supported version of peracid was reported by Pan et al.19 A peroxycarboxylic acid
         was immobilized on the surface of silica, then this oxidant was used for the epoxidation of
         vegetable oils at room temperature (Scheme 5). After 9 hours, the epoxidation of linseed oil
         was complete with 85% yield. The major by-products obtained are monoketone derivatives
         because silica is acidic and could play the role of a Bronsted acid catalyst and promote a
         Meinwald rearrangement.20 The regeneration of peracid was done using a mixture of hydrogen
         peroxide and a catalytic amount of sulfuric acid. Moreover, the oxidant could be easily
         separated, regenerated and recycled at least 5 times without any loss of activity.

                    An alternative pathway to replace the direct use of peracid was studied using a
         mixture of metal and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). According to Gerbase et al, the epoxidation of
         soybean oil was optimized in CH2Cl2/H2O2 biphasic system, using a catalytic amount of
         methyltrioxorhenium (CH3ReO3). The reaction was performed at room temperature and

       provided 95% of epoxidized products after only 2 hours.21 A similar work was also reported by
       Marks and Larock.22 In the presence of methyltrioxorhenium (0.34 mol%), pyridine (8.15 mol%)
       and hydrogen peroxide (1.0 equiv) in CH2Cl2 at 25°C, the epoxidation of Norway fish oil ethyl
       ester was complete and gave 86% yield of the desired products after 6 hours. However, the
       rhenium-based catalyst is expensive and not easy to recycle. Furthermore, the purification was
       difficult and the use of an external base led to a low atom-economy and the process is not easy
       to upscale.

           Along with peracid and hydrogen peroxide, a series of oxidizing agents was employed in the
       epoxidation of vegetable oil derivatives such as t-butyl hydrogen peroxide (t-BuOOH),23-24
       oxone25 or oxygen/aldehyde.26 Although these epoxidation reactions provided good yields (up
       to 99%), most of these methods suffer from the use of metal catalyst (such Mo, V, etc) or toxic
       solvents (CH2Cl2, C2H4Cl2) and finally can not replace the conventional epoxidation using
       mineral acid and hydrogen peroxide.

       2.1.2 Polyoxometalates
             Polyoxometalates (POM) are a class of anionic metal oxide in group V and VI. They are
         constructed through the condensation of metal oxide polyhedral (MOx, M= Mo, W, Nb, V, etc
         x= 4-7) with each other in the corner or edge. POMs are used as precursors of highly efficient
         catalysts for environmentally-friendly biphasic epoxidation with hydrogen peroxide. In the
         presence of an oxidant such H2O2, POM are converted to peroxopolyoxometalates (PPOM)
         which are active species for the epoxidation of triglyceride derivatives. PPOMs are often used
         with quaternary ammonium salts as phase transfer catalysts to increase the solubility of the
         subtrates and facilitate the regeneration of PPOM.

             There are six different types of POMs and PPOM, including Keggin, Dawson, Anderson,
         Lindqvist, Waugh and Silverton, in which Keggin-type structure, that has tetrahedrally-
         coordinated heteroatom, is the most stable one among various complexes (Figure 2).27

                 The first report using POM for epoxidation of petrol-based olefins such as 1-dodecene,
         1-octene, styrene or cyclohexene was studied by Venturello et al in 1983.28 In the presence of
         POMs based on W or Mo (1 mol%) in acidic medium, a quantitative conversion of hydrogen
         peroxide was obtained and approximately 80% of epoxidized derivatives were isolated after
         a short-time period (1-3 hours).

                There are a lot of researches to identify what species is the real “active” species for
         epoxidation of vegetable oils. They found that PPOM complexes play a crucial role for this
         transformation. Some of them were reported, in particularly Venturello’s anion
         ({PO4[WO(O2)2]}3-),28 Ishii’s anion ([PW12O40]3-)29 and Mizuno’s anion ([W2O3(O2)4]2-)30-31 (Figure

                 PPOM often exist as a salt in the combination with quaternary ammonium such tetra-(n-
         butyl) ammonium, methyltrioctyl ammonium or [S-C5H5N-(CH2)15CH3]+ and receive a lot of
         attention for selective epoxidation of vegetable oils. For example, the epoxidation of soybean
         oil using [S-C5H5N-(CH2)15CH3]3[PW4O16] as a catalyst, was complete after 3-4 hours and 90%
         of the desired products were obtained (Scheme 6).32

             However, these catalytic systems could be unstable. According to Leng et al, the selective
         epoxidation of soybean oils using PPOM gave 97% conversion and 82% selectivity after the
         first run.33 However, for the next three cycles, the conversion and selectivity declined
         significantly to 24% and 20%, respectively. The authors explained these results by FT-IR-
         analysis of the spent catalyst. The disappearance of the peak at 850 cm-1, corresponding to
         the signal of Venturello-Ishii’s anion, indicated that the loss of the active site PPOM could be
         responsible for the decrease of the catalytic performances.

             In order to improve the stablility and recyclability of the catalysts, POM were
         immobilized onto several supports. These supports could be organic such as resins34 or
         inorganic such silica35 or palygorskite.36 The supported version of PPOM was used for
         epoxidation and was easily separated by filtration. It was also described that PPOM have a
         good stability on the immobilized materials and the catalysts could be reused without loss of
         activity.

       2.1.3 Enzymatic epoxidation
             Enzymatic catalysis is an interesting pathway to access epoxidized vegetable oils with
         many advantages such as high conversion, good regio- and stereoselectivity, especially not
         giving any unwanted epoxide ring-opening products. The enzymatic epoxidation is often
         performed in tri-phasic media where H2O2 is in water phase, vegetable oils are in the organic
         phase (if necessary) and a solid catalyst containing the immobilized lipase, usually Candida
         antarcica lipase B (CLAB) supported onto acrylic resin (Novozym 435)37-38 or silica (CALB-
         silica).39 However, the mechanism of enzymatic epoxidation is specific and quite different in
         comparision with traditional epoxidation processes (Scheme 7). Firstly, perhydrolysis of
         vegetable oils was performed in the presence of lipase and hydrogen peroxide to give
         perfatty acid derivatives. Secondly, the perfatty acid can oxidize the olefin derivatives to
         provide EVO and corresponding fatty acid. Then, this acid was re-oxidized to peracid by

           action of hydrogen peroxide. Finally, at the end of reaction, the epoxy products were a
           mixture containing the mono-, di- and triglycerides products. To improve this method, a
           catalytic amount of organic acid (<5 mol%) such acetic acid was added to form the active
           species (peroxyacid) and avoid the hydrolytic activity.15,40




                                 Scheme 7: Enzymatic epoxidation of vegetable oils

               However, enzymatic epoxidation of vegetable oils showed a lower activity in comparison
           with chemical epoxidation process of free fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). It
           could be explained by the steric hindrance of triglycerides, leading to less interaction
           between active sites and plant oils. Moreover, the catalyst seems to be easily decomposed.
           In an investigation by Rios et al., epoxidation of methyl ester derived from jatropha oil using
           CALB-silica provided an excellent conversion (ca 100%) and selectivity (ca 100%) after 24
           hours.39 However, the catalyst completely deactivates after 1 cycle. The reasons for the
           decomposition of lipase might be the high temperature or high concentration of hydrogen
           peroxide. Finally, although obtaining good advantages in the view of selectivity and mild
           condition, enzymatic epoxidation has also several drawbacks such as a large excess of
           solvents is required, low conversion toward triglycerides, quick decomposition and high cost
           of lipases. Improving all of these points, the enzymatic epoxidation will get a chance to
           compete with the conventional epoxidation routes.

         2.1.4 Heterogeneous catalytic system
               In order to obtain an environmentally-friendly epoxidation and avoid the drawbacks of
           homogeneous catalytic systems, the development of novel heterogenous system received
           more and more attentions. Solid Lewis acids and Ti-based catalysts are commonly used as the
           heterogenized catalysts for the epoxidation of fatty acid derivatives.

              Solid Bronsted acids, most often acidic ion-exchange resins such Amberlite, Nafion or
         Aquivion, are substitutes for strong mineral acids in the conventional homogeneous
         epoxidation. They are functionalized polymers that could provide the acidic sites in the solid
         medium and resist at high temperature (ordinary between 120-170°C). Moreover, they could
         be easily separated and recycled after epoxidation process. According to Fišer et al,41 the
         epoxidation of castor oil in the catalytic system of AcOH/H2O2/Amberlite IR-120 provided
         78% yield of desired products (Scheme 8). Moreover, the solid Bronsted acid could be
         recycled at least 4 times without losing any activity.42 Unfortunately, approximately 15-20%
         (w/w subtrates) of solid Bronsted acid is often required for this kind of transformation, that
         could restrict the application of acid resins in large-scale epoxidation process.

                  More recently, Ti-based catalysts, in particular titanium silicates, are one of the best
          candidates for heterogeneous epoxidation of vegetable oils with hydrogen peroxide
          (Scheme 9). Indeed, Titanium silicates (TS) are tetrahedral Ti(IV) in the network with O and
          Si. In the presence of H2O2, these species could be changed the coordinated number to
          (VI).43 In this case, they often exist in the dioxirane form and they are able to electrophilic
          addition to triglycerides and release the epoxidized products.44-45

          allowed to access with only a small substrate. However, the epoxidation process occurred
          only on the external surface of titanium silicates. That is why it is more difficult to epoxidize
          triglyceride derivatives which have a more bulky structure. To improve this feature, TS was
          modified in order to obtain high specific-area materials. Indeed, there are two types of
          mesoporous titanium silicates materials: ordered and disordered. The first type, known
          from the early 1990’s, includes various mesostructure materials such as MCM-41, MCM-48,
          SBA-15, FSM-16, etc. The second type includes amorphous mixed oxide, which are less
          studied than the first type.47 According to Guidotti et al., the epoxidation of methyl oleate
          in the presence of Ti-MCM-41 gave an excellent conversion (96%) and selectivity (95%) of
          epoxidized products. Otherwise, the rate of the introduction of hydrogen peroxide had an
          influence to control the configuration of the epoxidized products. The epoxidation was
          performed in a slow addition of H2O2 and 85% of cis-epoxide was obtained.48 Recently,
          Yamashita et al developed a method to incorporate titanium silicate onto the surface of
          nanotube architectures. Satisfyingly, the rate of epoxidation of methyl oleate was increased
          by 3.8 times compared with Ti-containing mesoporous silicates and an excellent selectivity
          (98%) was achieved. Moreover, only few leaching or deactivation of catalyst were
          observed, indicating a robust and efficient heterogenous catalytic system.49

                 Ti/SiO2 was next used as a nanosized solid catalyst for the epoxidation of used cotton
          seed oils (UCSO).50 The reaction was carried out in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and
          formic acid with a catalytic amount of Ti/SiO2 at 35°C. After 5 hours, the catalyst was
          separated through filtration and a quantitative yield of epoxide (100%) was obtained
          (Scheme 10). Furthermore, this catalyst could be re-used over 5 cycles without loss of any
          activity. However, the yield of desired products dropped significantly in the 6th and 7th
          cycles, due to the leaching of Titanium species (0.15%w for each run) during the re-
          calcination process before reusing the catalyst.

          require new heterogenized catalysts which own high leaching-stablility, good water-

          organic frameworks (MOFs) that have high surface area, crystalline-open structure and
          tunable pore size.9,51

       2.1.5 Applications
              Epoxidized vegetable oils (EVOs) are the most important platforms in oleochemical
        industries. They are used not only as intermediates for synthesizing higher value-added
        compounds such polyols, polyesters or polyurethanes but also own numerous applications.
        In the past, EVOs were considered as the typical non-metalic stabilizers and secondary
        plasticizers for the production of PVC materials.52-53 Indeed, epoxy group in EVOs could
        absorb the hydrochloric acid gas (HCl) which is released from PVC during thermal process,
        thus leading to the increase of the stability of PVC or other halogenated polymers. On the
        other side, EVOs were also used as plasticizess for Poly Lactic Acid (PLA). A study showed that
        a blend mixture of PLA and epoxidized sunflower oils could improve the physical properties
        such as melt rheology and tensile strength.

              Furthermore, EVOs were used as potential bio-lubricants.54 It should be reminded that
        EVOs are high molecular weight molecules with high boiling point, non-toxic, cheap and bio-
        degradable. Furthermore, they have good properties required for lubricants such as high
        viscosity, low volatility. Other application of EVOs is the production of (nano)-composites.
        Actually, composite materials that were obtained from vinylation of EVOs, exhibited a great
        viscoelastic properties as natural rubbers. Because of that, composites are used in various
        construction fields such as roof, floor, wall of houses or some container materials. Moreover,
        reinforcement of nanocomposites by coating with some metal oxides such as Titanium-(IV)
        oxide could improve the physical properties and help to broaden the applications. Finally,
        EVOs were also used for the preparation of paints, coatings, adhesives or phenolic resins.55

     2.2 Monoketone
        Ketone derivatives are important intermediates to functionalize organic molecules and
     materials. The oxygenation of olefin subtrates is the most straightforward and fastest way to
     access this kind of compound. Indeed, there are many methods related to this transformation.
     However, only the advanced ones that could be applicable to oleochemical platforms will be
     presented.

      2.2.1      Wacker-Tsuji oxidation
            Wacker-Tsuji oxidation of olefin is the most efficient route to preprare ketone derivatives.
      Originally, terminal olefins were oxidized to ketones, catalyzed by PdCl2 in the mixture of
      solvent H2O/DMF, then Copper and oxygen were used to re-oxidize the Pd-species and close
      the catalytic cycle.56 One of the most typical examples for application of this oxidation was the
      production of acetaldehyde from ethylene.14 However, this method requires of a large amount
      of CuCl, leading to moderate yields (approximately 70%) and is limited to terminal olefins. With
      internal olefins, isomerization of C=C bond occurred and low yields of ketones were obtained.
      Recently, some advances were made to improve the conversion and yield of the desired
      compound derived from internal subtrates as well as to eliminate some drawbacks such the
      amount of Cu species.

            In 2009, Kumada et al demonstrated an oxidation of internal olefin using a catalytic
      amount of PdCl2 with several advantages such as high conversion and selectivity, copper-free,
      moderate temperature (80°C) and pressure (3 bar O2).57-58 However, this method requires a
      special apparatus (autoclave) and high pressure of oxygen (9 bar O2 before introducing alkenes
      followed by charging the autoclave with 3 bar of oxygen).

            More recently, Grubbs et al. described a catalytic method for the synthesis of ketones
      from both terminal and internal, alkyl and aromatic olefins.59-60 This process requires a simple
      palladium complex, a cheap oxidant (benzoquinone or oxygen), and was performed at room
      temperature. Moreover, this catalytic system could be used in the presence of different
      functional groups such alcohol, acid, ester, etc, indicating the tolerance of the method.
      Furthermore, this method was applicable not only to the aromatic substrates but also to
      oleochemical compounds. For example, the application of this method to methyl oleate gave
      84% yield of a 1:1 mixture of two fatty ketone regioisomers (Scheme 11).

       2.2.2      Nitrous oxidation
             Besides the Wacker-Tsuji oxidation, the ketonization of methyl oleate or triglyceride
       derivatives has gained more attention. Recently, Sels et al. disclosed a one-step procedure for
       solvent- and metal-free oxyfunctionalization of unsaturated fatty methyl esters and vegetable
       oils using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant.61 The oxidation of methyl oleate was investigated
       at 220°C in an autoclave that was charged with 40 bar of N2O. After 8 hours, an excellent
       conversion of methyl oleate (98%) was obtained and a good selectivity of oxo-compounds
       (99%) was achieved. A high oleic sunflower oil containing more than 90% of oleic moiety, was
       also investigated. The same conditions were used for ketonization of HOSO (240°C, 40 bar N2O)
       (Scheme 12). A quantitative conversion, with a ketone selectivity over 95%, was achieved
       within 24 hours, emphasizing the versatility of the method and could be used for valorization
       of wasted vegetable oils. However, the harsh conditions of the process (high temperature,
       elevated pressure) could limit its application.

       2.2.3      Meinwald rearrangement
             Other possible route to approach ketone compounds is the conversion of epoxidized
       subtrates. In early work, Meinwald reported that epoxidized substrates could be converted to
       ketones via a Meinwald rearrangement in the presence of a Lewis acid.20 Several studies were
       done on aromatic derivatives but there are a few studies on oleochemical platforms.
       Generally, ketone compounds were considered as un-wanted products from epoxidation
       process. In 2013, Doll et al. reported a simple method to synthesize ketones from epoxidized
       methyl oleate (Scheme 13).62 The reaction was investigated in the presence of Bi(OTf)3 (1
       mol%) at 30°C using DMSO as a solvent and a sole oxidant. A good yield (89%) of ketone
       derivatives was isolated after 2 hours. However, this method suffers from the non-recyclable
       metal catalyst and the used of a high boiling point solvent such as DMSO.

       2.2.4     Applications: polyesters, polyamides
            Ketones are important intermediates in organic synthesis. For example, they could be
       converted to hydroxy or amino group (Scheme 14). These compounds could be polymerized to
       provide new bio-based (co)polymers which could improve the physical properties of the
       original polymer. For instance, the amino-ester could be synthesized via reductive amination
       of ketone derived from methyl oleate, and could be used as co-polymer with nylon-6,6 to
       significantly reduce its water-uptake.63 Moreover, ketones derived from soybean oil were
       directly used for the formulation of lubricants and bio-based dielectric fluids.64

     2.3 Cyclic carbonates
          Nowadays, the preparation of cyclic carbonates has received more and more interests due
     to their applications. First of all, some small carbonates such ethylene carbonate, propylene
     carbonate are used as polar, high boiling point solvents in organic synthesis as well as electrolites
     in the production of Lithium batteries. Secondly, cyclic carbonates are also starting materials for
     the production of polycarbonates and polyurethanes (PUs) that are used as thermoplastic,
     foaming, coating and adhesive materials.65 Indeed, the world’s production of polyurethane
     reached 20.4 million tons in 2017,66 in which most of them were prepared via the conventional
     pathway: condensation of polyol and isocynate substrates that are highly toxic. Then, the
     alternative generation of PUs, known as non-isocyanate polyurethanes (NIPUs), is the
     condensation of cyclic carbonates and polyamines. Actually, there are two main routes to

     synthesize these intermediates. The first pathway involves the condensation of diol with dialkyl
     carbonate or phosgene. However, this method suffers from the formation of alcohol or
     hydrochloride as co-products or using an extremely toxic agent (COCl2). The second route is the
     fixation of CO2 and epoxidized subtrates. This method provides a 100% atom economy and
     valorizes carbon dioxide which is a global warming agent. It is possible to couple CO2 with
     epoxidized vegetable oils (EVOs) to synthesize carbonated vegetable oils (CVOs) then to prepare
     new types of bio-based polyurethanes. There are a great number of catalytic systems for the
     addition of carbon dioxide into epoxide subtrates but only efficient methods that were applied to
     oleochemical platforms will be presented.

       2.3.1     Quaternary ammonium salts
            Quaternary ammonium halides were first used as catalysts for fixation of CO2 onto
       epoxidized substrates. Basically, in the presence of ammonium salt, the oxirane could be
       activated, thus the halides could attack the epoxide to open this compound, following by the
       addition of CO2 and epoxide ring-closing to release the cyclic carbonate and halide anion
       (Scheme 15).67




Scheme 15: Mechanism of the fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates catalysed by tetraalkyl ammonium halides

            There are many types of tetraalkyl ammonium halides used for this transformation and
       they exhibit different activities, depending on the counter-anion. On the one hand, TBAC and
       TBAF gave poor results with the coupling of CO2 and epoxides. On the contrary, TBAB and TBAI
       provided good results even with the non-polar, unactivated oxirane subtrates such as EVOs.
       According to Hou et al., carbonation of epoxidized cotton seed oil was investigated in the
       presence of TBAB (3.75 mol%) at 140°C in compressed CO2 (30 bar) (Scheme 16).68 A
       quantitative conversion of ECSO was observed with an excellent selectivity (99%) of desired
       product after 24 hours. Moreover, the carbonated oil was used as new bio-lubricants.
       However, this catalyst could not be reused.

           To recycle these catalysts, immobilization of quartenary ammonium on solid carriers such
      as polymer,69 silica70 has been performed. There have been a few methods to immobilize the
      active species on supported materials. On the one hand, the trialkylamine could be grafted on
      halide-functionalized polymers. On the other hand, ammonium salts could be immobilized
      onto surface of materials by physisorption. Most of these catalysts exhibit high conversion and
      selectivity and could be re-used but some drawbacks remain such as harsh conditions
      (elevated pressure (20-80 bar) of CO2) and limited conversion for disubtituted subtrates and
      EVOs.

      2.3.2      Phosphonium salts
           Phosphonium salts could also be used as catalysts for coupling CO2 and epoxides. An
      initial attempt was reported by Nishikubo et al, employing tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide as
      a catalytic active species. A moderate yield (35%) was obtained for phenoxy methyl epoxide,
      similarly than ammonium salt.71 However, the use of phosphonium salts for this reaction was
      quite underexploited. Recently, Werner et al. reported a catalytic system consisting of MoO3
      and [Bu4P]Br.72 In the presence of MoO3 as an activating agent of epoxide and phosphonium
      bromide as a nucleophilic catalyst at 100°C and 50 bar of CO2, the carbonation of epoxidized
      high-oleic sunflower oil provided a good conversion (99%) and selectivity (95%) after 20 hours
      (Scheme 17). A similar work was also reported Büttner et al., replacing the Mo-based catalyst
      by an iron-based catalyst such as FeCl3.73 Similar performances were obtained with epoxidized
      FAMEs or EVOs.

       Scheme 17: Catalytic carbonation of epoxidized high-oleic sunflower oil in the presence of Mo-based
       catalyst and tetrabutyl phosphonium bromide

            To improve the efficiency and the recycling capacity of these catalysts, some
       heterogeneous versions of phosphonium salts were developed, in which tetrabutyl
       phosphonium halide was grafted on fluorous polymer74 or silica.75-76 Sakakura et al. were the
       first to report the immobilization of phosphonium halide onto silica.75 In this case, silanol group
       (Si-OH) in silica could play the role of an activating agent for the epoxide and halide as
       nucleophilic agent, leading to a synergistic effect on the fixation of carbon dioxide onto
       epoxides. Moreover, this supported catalyst could be easily separated and re-used at least 10
       cycles without losing any activity.76

            Other phosphorous species such as modified cyclotriphosphazane,77 azo- phosphatrane78
       or phosphorus ylide79 were also considered as catalysts for addition of CO2 into epoxides.
       However, most catalysts provided a good yield for terminal epoxides and a limitation of yield
       of cyclic carbonates were reported for difficult substrates such as disubtituted epoxides or
       EVOs.

       2.3.3      Imidazolium salts
            Imidazolium salts are important catalysts for the fixation of CO2 into epoxidized
       substrates. However, the use of this family for epoxy fatty platforms is quite underdeveloped.
       In the literature, there are a few examples for this catalytic transformation. One of them is a
       carbonation of diepoxy methyl linoleate at 100°C and high pressure of CO2, using a BMIm-Cl (5
       mol%) as the catalyst.80 After 17 hours, an excellent selectivity (100%) was observed for the
       desired product, but the conversion was limited to 26%, due to the bulky structure of internal

      epoxides. However, the use of imidazolium for the fixation of CO2 onto terminal and aromatic
      epoxides was proved a long time ago. Another investigation of the cycloaddition of CO2 onto
      epoxidized linseed oil was reported by Tassaing et al.81 Using n-octylimidazolium iodide as the
      catalyst, the carbonation of ELO at 100°C and 100 bar CO2 provided only 25% conversion after
      5 hours (Scheme 18).




               Scheme 18: Carbonation of epoxidized linseed oil catalyzed by imidazolium iodide

            In 2001, Deng et al. were the first to use an imidazolium salt as the active catalyst for the
      preparation of propylene carbonate.82 The reaction was performed at 110°C and 20 bar of CO2
      and gave an excellent conversion and selectivity of carbonate products. The studies also
      mentioned that the reactivity of imidazolium salts was depending on the length of the alkyl
      chain and the nature of counter-anion. On the one hand, the increasing of the length of the
      alkyl chain (C2 to C8) improved the conversion of the cycloaddition.83 On the other hand,
      iodide and BF4 anions were the best candidates for fixation of CO2 due to their strong
      nucleophilic and good leaving-group abilities.84-85 However, these catalytic systems needed a
      high temperature and high pressure of CO2. To improve this feature, a ternary catalyst
      ZnBr2/K2CO3/ionic liquid was developed by Shi et al., thus allowing the fixation of CO2 in
      styrene oxide at room temperature and atmospheric CO2 (or even with flue CO2).86 In this case,
      zinc bromide was acting as a Lewis acid to activate the oxirane then imidazolydene-CO2 adduct
      was acting as an active species for the formation of a cyclic carbonate. Moreover, this catalytic
      system could be recycled at least 5 times without significant loss of activity.

            Recently, the grafting of imidazolium salt onto supported material has received more
      attention. The imidazolium species could be immobilized on the surface of fibrous silica,87
      graphene oxide,88 chitosan89 or cellulose.90 The fixation of CO2 using these catalysts gave good

                                 CHAPTER I: VEGETABLE OIL

       results for terminal epoxides and the recycling of the catalysts was quite simple. Only best
       catalytic systems are detailed here such as imidazolium/urea on silica and polyimidazolium on
       metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Firstly, the imidazolium-urea network supported on
       mesoporous silica was reported by Arai et al.91 In this case, there was a double activation of
       epoxide by urea moiety and proton of the imidazolium salt. The fixation of CO2 onto propylene
       oxide was performed at elevated temperature (110°C) and pressure (25 bar CO2) to give 96%
       yield after 4 hours. However, the scope was limited for disubtituted oxirane compounds. The
       synthesis of polyimidazolium was quite interesting feature in the view of capturing CO2. Vinyl
       imidazolium halide was self-polymerized, followed by absorption on the surface of high surface
       materials such as MIL-101.92-93 Owning to the high surface area, hierarchical pores and the
       synergistic effect between the Lewis acid and Lewis base active site, the fixation of carbon
       dioxide onto oxirane substrates could be performed at moderate temperature (45-70°C) and
       atmospheric CO2 and provided good yields of cyclic carbonates. Furthermore, the
       heterogeneous catalyst could be reused 10 times without losing any activity, highlighting the
       high efficiency of this catalyst.

       2.3.4      Metal-based catalyst
            At the very beginning, metal-based catalysts such as ZnBr2, Zn(OAc)2 were used as the
       Lewis acids for the coupling of epoxides and CO2.94 Due to synergistic effects between metal
       and imidazolium salt, aromatic epoxides could be converted to the corresponding carbonates
       with a high conversion and selectivity. However, this process was performed at elevated
       pressure of CO2 (40 bar) and no example for aliphatic or bulky epoxides was reported.

            Recently, there has been a series of publications mentioning that the addition of CO2 into
       epoxide could be carried out under milder conditions in the presence of metal complexes. In
       2018, Werner et al. developed a catalytic system using CaI2 and 18-crown-6 (5 mol%) in the
       presence of a cocatalyst such as Ph3P (5 mol%) for the preparation of carbonated sunflower
       oil.95 The reaction was performed in mild condition (45°C, 5 bar of CO2). After 24 hours, a
       quantitative conversion and selectivity were achieved, indicating a powerful catalyst for
       synthesis of carbonated vegetable oils (Scheme 19).

              Kleij et al. have also reported on the use of aluminum(III) aminotriphenolate in
         combination with tetrabutyl ammonium halides or bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium chloride
         (PPNCl) as the nucleophilic agent for the cycloaddition of CO2 onto fatty epoxides.96 The
         reaction was investigated at 70°C with 5 bar of CO2. After 24 hours, excellent conversion and
         selectivity (>99%) were observed (Scheme 20). Moreover, this study also mentioned that the
         stereoselectivity of cyclic carbonates was depending on the nature of the counter-anion. The
         use of chlorine-based nucleophiles can selectively promote for the formation of cis-cyclic
         carbonates.

         and zinc or magnesium compounds. Later, the tetraalkyl ammonium halide was grafted on
         the chain of the porphyrin complex to make a binary functionalization of the catalyst. Then,
         the fixation of carbon dioxide onto epoxides was carried out at 120°C in the presence of CO2
         pressure (17 bar) for 3 hours and provided a good yield for carbonate products. Moreover,
         this method used a very low catalyst loading with a really high TON (the best performance
         gave a TON of 240,000). However, the studies focused on terminal epoxides and no example

         with fatty substrates was reported. More recently, simple conditions for carbonate vegetable
         oils were developed by Safari et al., based on a binary complex of Mn-porphyrin and
         tetrabutylammonium bromine.100 In the presence of 4 mol% of catalytic system, the coupling
         of CO2 and epoxidized sunflower oil gave an excellent yield (99%) after 30 hours under
         atmospheric CO2 (Scheme 21). Moreover, this catalyst could be recycled several times.
         However, the yield significantly dropped from 99% in the 1st run to 62% in the 5th run, maybe
         due to the leaching of Mn-complex, highlighting the limitation of this process.

      2.4 Diols
         Among all derivatives of vegetable oils, vicinal diols (or dihydroxylated fatty compounds) are
      also interesting platforms with a wide range of applications. First of all, oleochemical diols were
      used in the conventional production of polyurethanes via condensations of polyols and
      polyisocyanates.101 This family of polymers displays a good behavior in thermoplastics,
      elastomers, etc. There are various applications using polyurethanes in the production of
      elastomers, foaming and coating materials. Secondly, diol derivatives could be used as
      intermediates in the production of estolides or hyperbranched polyesters.102 Furthermore, diacyl
      originated from diol substrates could be used as alternative bio-lubricants.103-104 On the other
      side, dihydroxylated fatty compounds are important intermediates in the oleochemical
      transformations. They could be cleaved in the presence of metal (Ru, Mo, W, etc) with an oxidant
      (oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and oxone) to pelargonic and azelaic acids that have a large market
      in pesticides, plasticizers or in the polymer industry.105 Moreover, this type of intermediates
      could be also cleaved into two aldehydes: nonanal and methyl azelaaldehydate which are used in

         2.4.1.1     KMnO4
              In a very early report (1925), a dilute alkaline solution of KMnO4 was used for the
         dihydroxylation of oleic acid. Reported by Lapworth et al.,107 the conditions for this process
         should be carefully controlled: 1) the temperature should be controlled between 0-10°C, 2)
         the concentration of oleic acid (to make the salt) should not exceed 1%, 3) the concentration
         of KMnO4 should not exceed 1%, 4) a short-period of reaction time (5 minutes) and a slight
         excess of alkaline solution (KOH or NaOH) was necessary to avoid the generation of D-
         hydroxyketone fatty derivatives. Following such precise conditions, an excellent yield of 9,10-
         dihydroxy octadecanoic acid (96% yield) was achieved (Scheme 22).

         2.4.1.2     Upjohn dihydroxylation
              The direct dihydroxylation of oleic acid was reported by Milas et al., using a
         stoichiometric amount of OsO4 as an oxidant and hydrogen peroxide as a co-oxidant (for re-
         oxidation of Os(VI) to Os(VIII)).108 The reaction was carried out at 0°C for 20 hours and
         provided a moderate yield of the corresponding diol (60%) (Scheme 23). However, OsO4 is
         extremely toxic and expensive. Therefore, its use should be limited in the catalytic amount.

              Recently, several advances were reported to avoid the limitations of Milas’s methods. A
         catalytic amount of OsO4 was used instead of an excess amount. An excess of N-
         methylmorpholine was used in order to re-oxidize the Os(VI) to Os(VIII) species.109

              In order to access a highly-pure enantiomer of vicinal fatty diols, Sharpless et al.
        developed a new process, using osmium as a catalyst and a stoichiometric amount of NMO
        or K3Fe(CN)6 as the co-oxidant. Moreover, to control the enantioselectivity, the reaction
        required the use AD-mix-D or AD-mix-E. The enantioselectivity of the desired product was
        achieved via the addition of chiral quinine ligand into osmium-based catalyst, leading to
        control the side of the attack. In 1997, Schäfer et al. applied this strategy to fatty substrates
        (Scheme 25).111 For example, the sharpless dihydroxylation of methyl oleate provided a good
        isolated yield of threo-isomers (97-95%) with high enantiomeric excess (95-97%).

        First of all, the formation of a cyclic iodonium was performed in the presence of iodine,
        followed by nucleophilic substitution of benzoate anion to generate a anti-disubtituted
        dibenzoate intermediate. Finally, this species was hydrolyzed in the alkaline solution to give
        the anti-diol. Later, Woodward developed a modification to synthesize syn-diol.113 The key of
        this process is the nucleophilic substitution of cycloiodonium in wet acetic acid. Considering
        the acetate was less hindered than the benzoate and contains an amount of water, the cyclic
        intermediate was cleaved into syn-monoacylated diol. Finally, the hydrolysis was performed
        in alkaline condition to give a good yield of syn-diol. In 1957, Gunstone and Morris have
        applied the Woodward modification to fatty substrates including triglycerides.114 The process
        worked well for methyl oleate and gave a good yield (89%) of erythro-diol (Scheme 26).

              In 2010, NOVAMONT Corporation developed a one-step process to prepare
        dihydroxylated vegetable oils in continuous flow.115 The process was based on domino
        reactions: epoxidation and hydrolysis, catalyzed by a mineral acid, in which the best
        performance was given by tungstic acid (H2WO4). Hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidant
        and the process was performed at 62°C under reduced pressure. Moreover, it should be
        noted that the addition of hydrogen peroxide is a highly exothermic process. Consequently,
        the amount of hydrogen peroxide should be introduced dropwise in flow. When the addition
        of the oxidizing agent was complete, the reaction was extended for 2-4 hours and gave a
        good yield of hydroxylated triglycerides (Scheme 27).

           2.4.2.1      Acid-catalyzed
                 To simplify the procedure for the preparation of vicinal diols and to avoid the formation
           of by-products from the one-step synthesis, some researchers studied the ring-opening of
           epoxidized fatty derivatives in the presence of acid catalyst. According to Blach et al, the
           epoxidized vegetable oil was prepared via a traditional epoxidation pathway, using a mixture
           of formic acid and hydrogen peroxide at 60°C for 4 hours.116 Then, the hydrolysis of epoxides
           was studied at 90°C using a catalytic amount of a series of acid such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, etc.
           These studies also indicated that a good yield (> 80%) of dihydroxylated substrates were
           obtained in the presence of a strong mineral acid. A specific effect was observed when using
           phosphorous acid (H3PO3) as a catalyst, exhibiting an excellent yield of desired products
           (98%) (Scheme 28).

                Even if this process is a simple procedure and uses a catalytic amount of mineral acid,
           this catalyst could not be reused. In the view of green chemistry, especially the use of
           recyclable catalysts, Sato et al. proposed a procedure for the synthetic of vicinal biosourced
           diol in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid resin such as Nafion-50.117 Starting from
           oleic acid, the hydroxylation process occurred in 2 steps through the epoxidation (acid
           catalyzed, H2O2), following by ring-opening of oxiranes (acid catalyzed, H2O) to give a good
           yield of diol product (80%) (Scheme 29).

            2.4.2.2      Enzymatic ring-opening of epoxidized fatty substrates
                 Besides chemical pathways for the preparation of vicinal diol compounds, enzymatic
            routes could be an option to avoid the use of external organic acid. In the presence of an
            epoxy hydrolase enzyme from soy flour, the epoxidized fatty derivatives could be converted
            to the corresponding diol.118 However, this process requires a long reaction time (100 hours)
            and is dependent on the substrate. On the one hand, the hydrolysis of epoxidized oleic acid
            and epoxidized vernolic acid provided a complete conversion after 100 hours. On the other
            hand, only 73% conversion of epoxidized ricinoleic acid was reached, might be due to the
            presence of the free OH in this fatty acid derivative. This point indicates the limitation of this
            enzymatic system for ricinoleic acid and some other similar substrates.

       2.5 Hydroformylation
              Hydroformylation is an important homologation reaction in organic synthesis because it can
       introduce one more carbon in the molecular structure as well as introduce a new functionality
       (carbonyl group). This intermediate could be easily converted to the corresponding acids,
       amines, alcohols that are very useful in the preparation of surfactants, polyesters, polyurethanes,
       etc. Considering the importance of hydroformylation, a brief history of this transformation will be
       given for the fatty derivatives.

          2.5.1      Initial result for Co and Rh-based catalysts
                 The first example of the hydroformylation of fatty substrates was reported by Natta and
          Beati, using partly “reduced CoO activated” grafted on a betonite material.119 This process
          occurred at 100-150°C under 20 bar pressure of CO/H2 and gave a moderate yield for the
          aldehyde. In 1969, Frankel et al. developed an oxo-process, using dicobalt octacarbonyl as a

       catalyst.120 This hydroformylation was performed under high pressure of syngas (241-315 bar)
       at 110°C to provide mono-aldehyde products with 42-84% yield, depending on the substrate.
       However, this method suffers from a lack of yield and selectivity of the desired products
       (branched/linear/isomerization), over-reduction (alcohol product). Moreover, the Co-catalyst
       requires harsh conditions for the oxo-process such as an elevated pressure and temperature.

              In 1971, an efficient catalytic system for the hydroformylation of methyl oleate was
       discovered by Frankel, using a Rh-based catalyst in the presence of triphenylphosphine as the
       ligand.121 The process was carried out in mild conditions (95-110°C, a 1:1 mixture of CO and H2,
       34-138 bar) and gave an excellent yield (94%) of 9(10)-formyl products. It should be noted
       that, the presence of phosphine ligand inhibits side reactions such as isomerization and
       hydrogenation, thus leading to a good yield of 9(10)-oxo products. However, this process still
       requires a high pressure of syngas (CO/H2). An optimized condition was developed by
       Friedrich, using triphenyl phosphite as ligand and an activated supported Rhodium-catalyst.122
       The hydroformylation was performed at 120°C in the presence of 14 bar of syngas. A nearly
       complete conversion was observed after 4 hours and a good yield (92%) of formyl products
       was achieved (Scheme 30).




          Scheme 30: Hydroformylation of methyl oleate in the presence of activated Rh-triphenylphosphite

              However, Rhodium is one of the most expensive noble metal (ca 1913 euros/ozt,123
         more expensive than gold or platinium), so this hydroformylation process should be further
         developed toward a higher efficiency (lower catalyst loading) and a quantitative recycling of
         Rhodium      catalyst.   Recently,     there    have    been     many     studies    investigating     the
         hydroformylation process with a series of different Rhodium precusors such as RhCl3,
         Rh(CO)H(PPh3)3, Rh(acac)(CO)2 and different bulky phosphine-based ligands such as DPEphos,
         BIPHEPHOS, etc.124,125,126 In 2014, Borner et al. discovered a new hydroformylation process
         under mild conditions. The reaction was performed with 0.11 mol% of Rh(acac)(CO)2 as the
         precursor and phosphoramidite as monodentate phosphorous ligand at 80°C in the presence

         2.5.2.1      Isomerization-hydroformylation
              In 2005, Behr et al. discovered a domino isomerization-hydroformylation of methyl
         oleate.128 In the presence of Rh(acac)(CO)2 and BIPHEPHOS ligand, the sequence reaction was
         investigated at 125°C under elevated pressure of syngas (10-40 bar). However, only 60%
         conversion of methyl oleate was obtained and the best yield of Z-oxo substrate (26%) was
         reached using 10 bar of syngas after 17 hours. Some factors were evaluated to improve the
         results. On the one hand, increasing the temperature resulted in better conversion but the
         selectivity declined due to competing hydrogenation reaction. On the other hand, decreasing
         the temperature favored the generation of branched isomers. It should be noted that
         rhodium is not a good catalyst for the isomerization process. Then, to favor the production of
         terminal aldehyde derived from fatty compounds, a bimetallic strategy for isomerization-
         hydroformylation was developed by Vorholt et al.129 In this process, a Palladium catalyst was
         used for the isomerization in combination with a Rhodium catalyst for hydroformylation. A
         complete conversion of methyl oleate was observed but only 74% yield of aldehyde was
         achieved with the linear/branched ratio 91/9 (Scheme 32). The rest of the starting material
         was converted to methyl stearate through hydrogenation.

                 In 2013, a complex tandem reaction, so-called isomerization-hydroformylation-
           hydrogenation, was reported by Nozaki et al., employing a ternary-catalyst system.130 By the
           combination of a mixture of Rh(acac)(CO)2, bisphosphite ligand and Shvo’s catalyst, methyl
           oleate was converted to the alcohol (67% yield) with a ratio of linear/branched 4.4/1
           (Scheme 33). Besides of that, 29% yield of methyl stearate was also obtained as the major by-
           product for this transformation.

           2.5.2.2      Hydroformylation-hydrogenation
                 The first attempt for the one-pot, two-reaction hydroformylation-hydrogenation of
           methyl linoleate was reported by Frankel et al., using a cobalt catalyst.120 However, this
           process requires harsh conditions (250-300 bar of syngas, 180°C, a toxic solvent such
           benzene) and gave a good yield (87%) of branched hydroxylated products. Indeed, there are
           two C=C bonds in methyl linoleate. One double bond was hydrogenated whereas the second
           one was hydroformylated, followed by hydrogenation to give the mono-hydroxy products.
           The same procedure was applied to methyl oleate in the presence of tributyl phosphine as a
           ligand but a low yield (16%) of a linear terminal alcohol derivative was observed due to auto-
           tandem three-reactions: isomerization-hydroformylation-hydrogenation. Recently, Hapiot et
           al. developed a hydrohydroxymethylation of methyl oleate, employing a Rhodium catalyst
           and tertiary amine ligand.131 The domino reaction was performed in smooth conditions (80°C,
           80 bar CO/H2) in toluene. After 6 hours, a nearly quantitative conversion (94%) of olive oil
           was observed with 90% of hydroxylated products (Scheme 34).

            2.5.2.3      Hydroaminomethylation (HAM)
                     The hydroaminomethylation includes three consecutive reactions: hydroformylation,
            amine condensation and hydrogenation, to generate an amino fatty compound that could be
            useful in the production of surfactant or polymer. This domino reaction is often catalyzed by
            a single rhodium precusor in the presence of amine used as both the ligand and the
            nucleophilic agent under high pressure of syngas. In 2000, Behr et al. have reported the HAM
            process of ethyl oleate in the presence of primary or secondary amines.132 Employing 0.5
            mol% of [Rh(cod)Cl]2 as the catalyst, the HAM of fatty substrates with aliphatic or aromatic
            amines provided excellent yields (91-99%) of the desired products (Scheme 35). Moreover,
            the use of an excess of fatty derivatives (2 equiv) could be converted to bi-functional
            platforms with a good yield that could be useful in the polymer industry. However, low yield
            (<5%) were observed with the bulky secondary amine such as diisopropylamine, indicating
            the limitation of this catalytic system.

                 More recently, Hapiot et al. reported the HAM process with a secondary amine on a
            challenging substrate such as triolein.133 The reaction was performed in the presence of
            Rh(acac)(CO)2 in toluene at 80°C under high pressure of syngas (80 bar, CO/H2 2/1). The good
            conversion (92%) of triolein was observed after 6 hours with a 83% selectivity towards the
            desired product (Scheme 36). However, this method suffers from a lack of selectivity (the
            formation of alcohol and hydrogenated products).

         2.5.3      Applications
               Herein, we have summarized most of different pathways to incorporate a formyl group
         onto fatty substrates. Starting from this point, it could be easily converted to polyols (for the
         traditional production of PUs), polyamines (for the production of NIPUs) and to bifunctional
         bio-based chemical platforms that could be useful in the synthesis of surfactants and
         polymers.134-135

      2.6 Other transformations
             Besides all described transformations, oleochemical derivatives could be converted to a
      series of useful chemical platforms.15 For instance, thiol-ene coupling of internal unsaturated fatty
      compounds with a thiol could give access to a new class of carboxylic acids or alcohols that could
      be applied to the production of polymers or bio-lubricants.136 Hydroalkylation of oleic acid
      derivative in the presence of aluminum Lewis acid could add one more alkyl group in the chain
      that helps to modify the physical properties of bio-diesel.137

3. Cleavage of vegetable oils derivatives
          Besides the functionalization of unsaturated fatty substrates, the cleavage of unsaturated
      vegetable oils and their derivatives is also interesting due to the wide range of applications.143 For
      example, pelargonic acid, obtained from the oxidative ozonolysis of oleic acid, is an herbicide in
      agriculture. Moreover, the cleavage products can be also converted to higher value-added
      compounds through chemical transformations. For instance, undecylenic acid obtained through a
      pyrolytic cleavage of ricinoleic acid, could be used as a starting material for multi-step synthesis of
      the precursor of Nylon-11. Considering the interest of the cleavage products, the major cleavage
      processes of oleochemical platforms will be highlighted.

      3.1 Thermal cleavage: Retro-ene
            Castor oil is one of the most useful vegetable oils that has a variety of nonfood applications
       such as polyols, polyurethanes or plasticizers. Each year, more than a million ton of castor seeds
       are produced over the world.144 There are several unsaturated acids in the composition of castor
       oil, in which ricinoleic acid ((R,Z)-12-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid) represents from 85-95% of
       crude castor oil. Except conventional transformations, ricinoleic acid derivatives could be also
       cleaved to the useful products via McLafferty rearrangement.145

         3.1.1     Pyrolysis of ricinoleic acid derivatives
              The first thermal cleavage of ricinoleic acid was reported by Genas in 1962.146 Methyl
         ricinoleate was obtained through methanolysis of crude castor oil, then the pyrolysis of methyl

        ricinoleate was investigated at 550°C to provide an overall 75% yield of heptanal and
        undecylenic acid (Scheme 38, route a and b). This intermediate was converted to 11-
        aminoundecanoic acid through hydrobromination and amination, that can be polymerized to
        Nylon 11 (Scheme 38, route a). The co-product heptanal can be used for the synthesis of
        fragrances (jasminaldehyde, etc), guerbet alcohols or surfactants (Scheme 38, route b).147 For
        example, heptanal could be reduced to heptanol,148 that was used to prepare heptyl glucoside
        as a 100% bio-based surfactants.

        3.1.2    Alkaline thermal cleavage of ricinoleic acid.
            The thermal decomposition of ricinoleic acid was investigated in alkaline medium at
        elevated temperature (180°-250°C) (Scheme 38, route c and d).149 In the presence of NaOH as
        the catalyst, sebacic acid (C10) was obtained with a moderate yield (67%), together with Z-
        hydroxy fatty acid (19%). The C10-diacid was condensed with 1,6-diaminohexane for the
        production of the nylon-6,10. Moreover, dialkyl sebacates such as dibutyl sebacate and di 2-
        ethylhexyl sebacate could be used as plasticizers (Scheme 38, route c). Additionally, 2-octanol
        was also obtained as the co-product of alkaline fusion and was used in a variety of applications
        such as flavor, low-volatile solvent or defoaming agent in the production of pulp and paper
        (Scheme 38, route d).150

      was catalyzed by tungsten or molybdenum catalysts.151 However, these methods suffered from a
      low of selectivity and required high amount of catalyst. In 1996, a highly active, stable and
      chemically tolerant catalyst based on a ruthenium-carbene complex was innovated by Grubbs et
      al.152 Then, numerous transformations of chemical platforms were developed to make new
      interesting platforms as well as fragmentized the polymers based on olefin metathesis. In fact,
      the metathesis catalysts usually favor the formation of E-isomers, but recently Hoveyda et al.
      reported that the generation of Z-selective products is possible using a very bulky catalyst.153
      Even if this catalyst exhibites a really high TON but the homogeneous Ru-catalyst should be
      immobilized on insoluble materials which have high surface areas, large pores or narrow pore
      size distribution.154 In this context, we will only focus on the cleavage of unsaturated fatty
      substrates using Ruthenium carbene catalyst, including cross-metathesis, self-metathesis and
      ring-closing metathesis.

        3.2.1    Cross-metathesis

         3.2.1.1     Cross-metathesis with ethylene
              The interest for the ethenolysis of unsaturated vegetable oils lies on the uses of cleavage
         products. For example, methyl dec-9-enoate could be used as a key intermediate in the
         production of the Nylon-11, other polyesters and for the preparation of bioactive compounds
         such as the prostaglandin. Additionally, the co-product decene-1 could be employed for
         synthesis of the fatty aldehydes, the fatty acids via hydroformylation or oxidative cleavage
         process, that have a broad range of applications in the production of the surfactants,
         estolides or polymers (Scheme 39).

        derivatives (57-85%), caused by the formation of the self-metathesis compounds as the
        major by-products.

              Recently, the development of Ru-based catalysts has gained more interest after the
        innovation of Grubbs.152 Several modifications of the chemical structure of the ligand were
        carried out toward higher stablility of the catalyst as well as better performance (TON).
        Moreover, some of Grubbs catalysts are commercially available and have a wide range of
        applications in the transformation of oleochemical platforms and fossil-based feedstocks
        (Figure 4).

              In particular, several factors should be considered to obtain good results for
        ethenolysis.157 First of all, the purity of (bio)-ethylene should be more than 99.95% because
        of the presence of impurities such as carbon monoxide or acetylene that could poison or limit
        the reactivity of the catalyst. Secondly, a green solvent such as dimethyl carbonate could be
        used to avoid the formation of homometathesis products. Initially, the ethenolysis was often
        performed in neat conditions. However, the reaction suffered from the generation of self-
        metathesis products. The use of toluene could eliminate the formation of these by-products,
        but toluene is a toxic solvent. Then, the seeking of alternative solvents is also important to
        reach a greener process.158

              Other factors that should be considered are the temperature and pressure of ethylene.
        On the one hand, the ethenolysis was often carried out in moderate temperature between
        40-70°C to decrease the viscocity of the substrates, improve the solubility of ethylene as well
        as avoid the degradation of the catalyst. On the other hand, the increase of ethylene
        pressure could improve the reactivity of the catalysts. For instance, the conversion of methyl
        oleate, using a Grubbs-1st generation catalyst (200 ppm), reached 82% in the presence of
        16.5 bar ethylene, while only 56% conversion was obtained in the presence of 1 bar of
        ethylene. Finally, the chemical decomposition of catalysts should be also considered. For

           example, N-methyl morpholine as a stabilizing in toluene could substitute the phosphine
           ligand in Ruthenium catalyst, causing a decrease of the reactivity. Moreover, the Ru-based
           catalyst could be subjected to metathesis with ethylene to generate unstable ruthenium
           methylidene species, leading a decrease of the lifetime of the catalyst. Then the search of an
           highly active stable catalyst for metathesis is still highly demanded.

           3.2.1.2     Cross-metathesis with nitrile or hydroxyl derivatives
                Since the discovery of metathesis catalysts, numerous works to valorize fatty acid
           substrates into high value-added compounds have been reported. One of the most
           interesting pathway is the cross-metathesis of methyl oleate with functional compounds such
           acrylonitrile, fumaronitrile or cis-butene-1,4-diol (Scheme 40).159 In the presence of Grubbs-
           Hoveyda 2nd generation (Ru-2, 1 mol%, figure 4) and benzoquinone as an isomerization
           inhibitor, the reaction gave a quantitative conversion of methyl oleate after 2.5 hours at
           110°C. A mixture of Z/E-isomers was observed as the major product of the metathesis
           reaction (containing more than 88% GC ratio), in which Z-isomer, that is an opposite trend
           compared with the ethenolysis or self-metathesis of methyl oleate. These intermediates
           could be reduced under pressurized hydrogen and metal catalyst to key precursors for the
           production of Nylon-11 and Nylon-12. Moreover, the bi-functionalized hydroxy-ester could
           also be converted to polyamide precursors through multi-step synthesis or reduced to the
           corresponding Z-hydroxy fatty acid derivative that could be polymerized to give polyesters.

           homo-metathesis of methyl oleate at 55°C gave a good selectivity for the desired products
           (91%) and an unexpected high turnover number (440000). However, only 45% conversion of
           methyl oleate was observed, indicating the limitation of this metathesis reaction. A similar

         work was also reported by Foglia et al. In the presence of catalytic amount of the 2nd
         generation Grubbs catalyst (0.1 mol%), the self-metathesis of methyl oleate at 45°C provided
         a moderate conversion (50%) with a 39% isolated yield of the diester product after 3 days.161
         More interestingly, the self-metathesis of oleic acid in the same condition gave a good yield
         of the diacid derivatives (71%). However, a mixture of two isomers (Z/E) was obtained,
         indicating the lack of stereoselectivity for this transformation. Toward the remaining of
         configuration of the starting material and faster initiation, the new generation of catalyst was
         designed by Grubbs and Ahmed.162 In the presence of 0.1 mol% of a dithiolate catalyst (Ru-4,
         figure 4), the self-metathesis of methyl oleate or methyl elaidate in THF at room temperature
         gave a moderate conversion (50%) after 20 or 50 minutes. More interestingly, the
         stereoselectivity of the desired products reached 99% for only the Z or E-isomer. It should be
         noted that the self-metathesis products are interesting in term of applications. On the one
         hand, the dioleic acid is a whitening component in cosmetic.163 On the other hand, further
         reduction of unsaturated diester or diacid gives the corresponding saturated diester or D,Z-
         diol that are both useful in the production of polyesters (Scheme 40).164

              Other interesting oleochemical platforms could be obtained from the homo-metathesis
         of methyl ricinoleate that represents more than 85% in castor oil. Using Grubbs-II as the
         catalyst (Figure 4, Ru-2), the self-metathesis of methyl ricinoleate in ionic liquid at 60°C gave
         a conversion of 60% after 4 hours and an excellent selectivity toward the desired products
         (99%). Furthermore, the expensive catalyst could be recycled and reused without any loss of
         activity. Otherwise, the self-metathesis products of methyl ricinoleate are attractive
         intermediates for the preparation of diacids, diols (via reduction),thiol-ene coupling in the
         production of polyesters or polyurethanes (Scheme 41).165

       3.2.3       Ring-closing metathesis
            The first investigation on the synthesis of PA-11 or PA 12 precursors based on the ring-
       closing metathesis was reported by Yamamoto et al. in 2014.166 The process occurred in three-
       steps, including the amidation of oleic acid, ring-closing metathesis and reduction with a good
       yield for each step (Scheme 42). The key step in this consecutive reaction is the ring-closing
       metathesis, using the Hoveyda-Grubbs II (2 mol%). The reaction was examined using
       chlorobenzene as solvent at 120°C for 30 min. A nearly complete conversion (97%) was
       observed with a 71% yield of the ene-lactame product. The major by-product was the oligomer
       products (10%), coming from ring-opening metathesis of the ene-lactame. However, this
       reaction was carried out in chlorinated solvent at an elevated temperature that could degrade
       the catalyst. Toward a greener process, Yamamoto et al. also reported a modification with
       several advantages such as a lower temperature (60°C), a shorter reaction time (15 minutes),
       using the heterogenized catalyst and a greener solvent (EtOAc).167 To make it, the HG-II-type
       catalyst (M74SiPr) was grafted onto high surface area of mesoporous silica (such as MCM-41,
       SBA-15). Using these catalysts, the reaction provided an excellent conversion (93%) in only 15
       minutes with a good isolated yield (76%) of the desired product (Scheme 42). Moreover, these
       catalysts could be recycled and reused at least three times without any significant loss of
       activity.

      3.3 Cleavage of vicinal diol to the acids
         There are a variety of methods to cleave vicinal fatty diols into two carboxylic acids, using a
      stoichiometric amount of oxidant such as KMnO4, NaIO4, hydrogen peroxide, bleach, oxygen,
      etc. However, the utilization of non-green oxidants such as KMnO4 or NaIO4 requires a slight
      excess of reagent.168 Moreover, the process generates a large quantity of wastes (MnO2, NaIO3),
      causing to difficult purification of the desired products. In the context of green chemistry, we

      only describe the oxidative cleavage of vicinal diols, using green oxidants such as hydrogen
      peroxide, NaOCl solution or oxygen.

       3.3.1     Oxygen
            Oxygen is the cheapest and the most abundant oxidizing agents for the cleavage of vicinal
       diols. Only water is a by-product from this oxidation process. However, the use of molecular
       oxygen alone is not selective and leads to a low carbon balance. That is the reason why, a
       catalytic amount of metal complexes is required to obtain better performances.

            At the beginning, Cobalt (II) acetate was one of the best candidates for this kind of
       transformation. In 1972, Schereyer et al. claimed that in the presence of Cobalt salt (0.16
       mol%), the oxidative cleavage of oleic acid diol in AcOH at 50°C provided a good conversion.169
       Moreover, a good yield of pelargonic (86%) and azelaic acid (82%) was achieved after
       distillation. A similar work was reported by Nakazawa et al. in 1984.170 The cleavage of oleic
       acid diol was investigated in the presence of a mixture of Co(OAc)2 (5 mol%) and Mn(OAc)2 (2.5
       mol%), using 5 bar of oxygen. The reaction was performed at 100°C for 30 minutes to give a
       good yield of two corresponding fatty acids (68% for pelargonic acid, 81% for azelaic acid). In
       2011, a modified process was studied by Bierser et al.115 The cleavage of polyol vegetable oil
       was investigated in continuous flow of cobalt, using air as an oxidant. In the presence of
       certain amount of Co(OAc)2 (0.4 mol%), the reaction was conducted at 72°C in high pressure of
       air (22 bar, equivalent 2.5 bar of oxygen) for 5 hours. A good yield (70%) of pelargonic acid was
       isolated after this process. Then, the hydrolysis of the triglyceride was examined in acidic
       medium using Amberlyst to give a good yield of azelaic acid (73%) (Scheme 43). Recently, a C-C
       cleavage of vicinal diol from methyl oleate was also investigated in semi-continuous miniplant
       scale.171 The reaction was conducted in AcOH at 100°C, using Co(acac)2 and N-hydroxy
       phtalimide (NHPI) as promoters and molecular oxygen as an oxidant. After 6 hours, pelargonic
       and mono methyl azelate were obtained in a yield of 68% and 66%, respectively.

         conducted in pressurized air (8 bar) at 140°C for 15 hours. A mixture of products was
         esterified with methanol in the presence of Amberlyst to give a good yield of the
         corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (48% for methyl pelargonate and 44% for dimethyl
         azelate as determined by GC) (Scheme 44). A small portion of dimethyl sebacate and methyl
         caprylate was identified as the unwanted products from this cleavage.

         heterogeneous system based on gold.173 The gold species was supported on alumina, then
         was applied as the catalyst for this transformation. The reaction was conducted in the
         presence of oxygen (5 bar) in a strong basis aqueous solution at 80°C and provided in a high
         yields of pelargonic acid (99%) and azelaic acid (86%) (Scheme 45). Moreover, the catalyst
         was easily separated through filtration and re-used at least 5 times without significant loss of
         activity.

       3.3.2         Bleach
              In 2009, Lemaire et al. claimed that a quantitative formation of two corresponding fatty
         acids was achieved when a excess of bleach (3.2 equiv) was used for the oxidative cleavage
         of methyl 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecanoate in neat conditions at room temperature (Scheme
         46).174,175 Moreover, these conditions were applied to other fatty diols derived from oleic
         acid, dioleic acid, ricinoleic acid or linoleic acid. These intermediates were next esterified
         with methanol in acidic condition to give the corresponding fatty methyl ester with good
         yields (53-89%), indicating the versatility of this method. However, this method involves the
         leaching of chlorine anion and forms an important quantity of co-product (NaCl), showing the
         limitation of the use of bleach for this transformation.

       3.3.3     Hydrogen peroxide
              Hydrogen peroxide is also a cheap and promising oxidant for oxidative cleavage of diol
         derivatives. In comparison with bleach, it is even better because it contains a higher oxygen
         content than bleach (Table 1) and only water is a co-product. In fact, the cleavage of diol
         could be performed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide only but a low conversion and a
         lack of selectivity of desired products were observed, then a catalytic amount of the metal
         and ligand was applied to increase the kinetics of the reaction and reactivity of the cleavage.
         One of the efficient methods, using Ru-based catalyst was reported by Behr et al. (Scheme
         47).176 In the presence of Ru(acac)3 and dipicolinic acid (PDC), the cleavage of methyl 9,10-
         dihydroxystearate at 80°C provided an outstanding conversion (99%) and pelargonic acid and
         monomethyl azelate were obtained with 77% and 75% yield, respectively.

       3.3.4     Applications
            Pelargonic acid and its derivatives have a wide range of applications. In fact, there are
       three major pathways to access this compound: i) the oxidation of nonanal that was prepared
       via hydroformylation of 1-octene, ii) the oxidative ozonolysis of methyl oleate and iii) the
       oxidative cleavage of methyl oleate or dihydroxylated methyl oleate catalyzed by a metal
       species in the presence of air or oxygen. Among them, the third route is the dominant one
       with an available starting material, cheap catalyst and simple process, contrary to the two first,
       that required a special equipment, highly intensive energy process (ozonolysis) or derived from
       the cracking product of fossil materials. In 2012, the total comsumption of nonanoic acid was
       approximately 3x104 tons for a variety of applications.177 Firstly, pelargonic acid is considered
       as a bio-herbicide, not only for grass weeds but also for annual and perennial broadleaf.
       Secondly, pelargonic acid is used for the preparation of value-added compounds. For instance,
       nonivamide, that is a condensation product between vanillylamine and pelargonic acid, is used

        in the production of food additives such as flavoring, seasoning or spice blend. On the other
        side, neopolyol pelargonate is considered as a green lubricant and fluid for gas turbines
        because     of    its   good      thermal     stability    and     oxidation     resistance.      Otherwise,
        nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS) was developed in 1983 by P&G and was used as a
        bleach activator for superior performance in low-temperature laundry detergents.178,179

             Azelaic acid is a bio-dicarboxylic acid and could be found in a small content in many
        natural substances. Previously, the main production of this diacid was originated from
        oxidative ozonolysis process of oleic acid.180 However, this reaction involves with the
        generation of ozone that is the highly energy-intensive. More recently, azelaic acid was
        considered as the co-product from oxidative cleavage of oleic acid in the presence of air and
        metal.115 This dicarboxylic acid is also used in a variety of applications.181 Firstly, azelaic acid
        was used directly in pharmacy for the treatment of acnes. Moreover, azelaic acid is an
        important precursor for synthesis of higher value-added compounds. For instance, di 2-
        ethylhexyl azeleate is used as a plasticizer. The other dialkyl azeleates with a fatty alcohol such
        oleyl alcohol are used as bio-lubricants. Finally, nylon-6,9 that is a condensation product
        between azelaic acid and          hexamethylene diamine, is used as an extrude film for food
        packaging or as coating for wire.

      3.4 Ozonolysis
           Ozonolysis has been a powerful method for the cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids to oxo-
      products. It was mainly used for the production of pelargonic acid and azelaic acid from oleic
      acid. This reaction uses ozone that is a toxic and explosive gas even in a small quantity.
      Moreover, the generation of ozone is a highly intensive-energy process and requires special
      equipments. From a mechanistic point of view, the ozonisation process involves preliminary
      formation of ozonides. Otherwise, this reaction also generates other tetraoxanes (secondary
      ozonides) that are unstable and highly explosive intermediates.182 There are two strategies to
      access the final fatty derivatives from these ozonides: oxidative ozonolysis to fatty acids183 or
      reductive ozonolysis to fatty aldehydes.184

        3.4.1 Oxidative ozonolysis
             The oxidative ozonolysis of oleic acid was reported by Ackman et al. in 1961.183 The
        reaction was conducted in methanol at low temperature (-30°C) in the presence of ozone to

         form the primary ozonide intermediates. The oxidative step was performed in the presence of
         hydrogen peroxide and formic acid and provided a good yield of pelargonic acid (96%) and
         azelaic acid (98%) (Scheme 48). This study also mentioned that reaction medium has an
         important role for the formation of final products. On the one hand, polar solvents such water,
         methanol or AcOH favor the generation of peroxide and carbonyl products. On the other hand,
         non-polar solvents and chlorinated solvents promote to form the ozonide intermediates that
         could be isolated and converted to other family of compounds. This process was the major
         procedure in the industrial production of nonanoic acid and azelaic acid before the invention
         of the NOVAMONT process.115,180

         3.4.2 Reductive ozonolysis
               The reductive ozonolysis of oleic acid is an efficient cleavage to approach bio-aldehydes
         such as nonanal and methyl azelaaldehydate. Initially, this reduction reaction was conducted in
         the presence of zinc/AcOH or dimethyl sulfide or triaryl phosphine and gave good yields of the
         aldehydes (90-92%). However, the drawback of this reaction is the lack of selectivity
         (Zn/AcOH)185 or the purification process (Ph3P/Ph3PO).186 More recently, Louis et al. developed
         mild conditions to reduce ozonide intermediates into two aldehydes.184 The reaction was
         conducted in solvent-free condition at room temperature in the presence of heterogeneous
         catalyst Pd/C and hydrogen pressure to give two aldehydes with high yields (Scheme 49).
         Moreover, the catalyst Pd/C was easily separated through filtration and re-used at least 9
         times without loss of activity.

             Recently, the enzymatic cleavage has become a new trend in organic synthesis. Even if this
       transformation is working well using traditional chemical methods, the conditions often require a
       high temperature or a large amount of catalyst. Moreover, enzymatic oxidation often works with

      hydrophilic substrates such as carbohydrates. In this context, we describe the enzymatic cleavage
      that could be applicable to oleochemical platforms.

             Actually, one of the first enzymatic oxidation of fatty acid derivatives involves the Z-
      oxidation of fatty acids and was applied for the preparation of monomers such as fatty diacid for
      the production of bio-plastics.187 More recently, a study from Park et al. shows that an D,Z-fatty
      dicarboxylic could be synthesized via cleavage of fatty substrates, using a multi-enzymatic
      system.188 Indeed, the first model for this tandem reaction was a hydroxylated fatty acid such as
      ricinoleic acid and the combination of three enzymes was applied. Among them, an alcohol
      dehydrogenase (ADH) was used for the oxidation of secondary alcohol to corresponding ketone,
      a Bayer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) was involved for the oxidation of ketone to the fatty
      ester, then an esterase was used for the hydrolysis of the esters to access to heptanoic acid and
      Z-hydroxyl fatty acid with good yields (70%) which could be used as a bio-monomer or further
      oxidized to an D,Z-dicarboxylic acid.187 Otherwise, for other unsaturated fatty acids, the use of
      another enzyme such as a hydratase was required to convert unsatured fatty compounds to
      hydroxylated substrates (Scheme 50). Interestingly, there are two options for the Bayer-Villiger
      enzymatic oxidation and the use of enzymes is depended on their targets.

            Herein, we have summarized most the major pathways to cleave oleochemical platforms.
      Fatty aldehydes and fatty acids are considered as the dominant products from the cleavage
      process and are used for a wide range of applications such as herbicides, pharmaceuticals as well

4. N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)

       4.1 Overview
             N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are currently playing an important role in organic synthesis
       with a variety of application in commercial processing. It was first discovered by Ugai et al. in
       1943, that a thiazolium salt could be an active catalyst for acyloin condensation.189 To more
       understand this reaction, Breslow reported in detail the mechanism of the benzoin condensation,
       involving several steps. Among them, the nucleophilic addition of the free carbene to carbonyl
       compound to form the so-called “Breslow intermediate” was considered as the key intermediate
       for this transformation.190 Until now, plenty of NHCs were developed for different targets, in
       which there are three commonly families of this class, including thiazolylidene, Imidazolylidene
       and triazolylidene (Scheme 51).

             There are two major applications for carbenes. Firstly, NHCs could be used as ligands for
        the coordination to transition metals. After the discovery of Ruthenium carbene catalyst
        (Hoveyda-Grubbs II) for the olefin metathesis, thousands works were reported for designing
        new ligands to approach high selectivity for the Z or the E-isomer, and high enantiomeric excess
        (see Olefin metathesis). The second example for NHC-metal complexes was applied to
        palladium-catalysed cross-couplings such as Suzuki-Miyaura, Heck or Negishi reaction.191 One of
        the typical is Pd-PEPPSI-IPr, developed by Organ et al. that is easily prepared, highly-active

      stabilized catalyst and commercially available for alkyl-aryl cross coupling with many
      applications in pharmaceuticals.192

          Secondly, the free-carbenes could be used as organocatalysts for a wide array of
      transformations.191,193 This activity was mainly based on the “umpolung” concept,194 involving
      the attack of carbene onto a carbonyl group on the substrates to generate the so-called
      “Breslow intermediate”,190 then this species reacts with aldehyde, Michael acceptor or ester to
      access the desired products (Scheme 52). In fact, there are a variety of applications related to
      this reactivity, but in the context of this thesis, only some of the dominant transformations that
      could be applied to fatty acid derivatives, will be presented.

       4.1.1     Benzoin condensation
            One of the first applications of NHCs was to use these species as active catalysts for the
       benzoin condensation. Although this reaction was exploited since a long time notably with
       cyanides195 then with NHCs such as thiazolium salts or imidazolium salts,194 racemic mixtures of
       acyloin products were always observed. Initial attempt for the asymmetric benzoin
       condensation was described by Sheehan et al., using a chiral thiazolium salt as the catalyst.196
       However, a low yield or a low enantiomeric excess were observed. After the use of triazolium
       salts, one of the most efficient NHC to access highly enantioselective transformation was
       reported by Connor et al.197 In the presence of a triazolylidene precusor (4-8 mol%), the
       benzoin condensation of aromatic aldehydes provided more than 90% yield of D-
       hydroxyketones with high enantiomeric excess (>90%) (Scheme 53). A key of this catalytic

               The second challenge for the benzoin condensation was the cross-benzoin condensation
          between aromatic aldehydes with aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes. In fact, the cross-benzoin of
          two aldehydes could provide a mixture of 4 products. Then, several strategies were proposed
          to access a good yield of cross-benzoin condensation products such as an excess of aliphatic
          aldehyde or selective formation of Breslow intermediate with aliphatic aldehydes. The first
          pathway was reported by Yang et al., who described the condensation of 4-
          chlorobenzaldehyde with an excess of acetaldehyde (10 equiv) in the presence of thiazolium or
          triazolium salts (Scheme 54).198 A good yield of cross-benzoin products was achieved for both
          catalysts. Interestingly, each catalyst could promote the formation of different regioisomers,
          due to the difference in electronic and steric properties. On the one hand, nucleophilic attack
          of thiazolium salt on aromatic aldehyde rather than acetaldehyde affords the most resonance-
          stabilized    Breslow     intermediate      that    reacts    with    acetaldehyde   to   release    the
          thermodynamically stable product. On the contrary, the more sterically demanding triazolium
          prefers to attack the aliphatic aldehyde than aromatic one, thus promoting the formation of
          the second regioisomer.

            A similar strategy for cross aryl-alkyl benzoin condensation was developed by Gravel et
      al., using a triazolium catalysts incorporating a fused morpholine or piperidine ring, that
      preferes to generate the Breslow intermediate with aliphatic aldehyde than aromatic
      aldehyde.199 Instead of using a high excess of aliphatic aldehyde such as the Yang’s studies,
      only slight excess of aliphatic aldehydes (1.5 equiv) was used and good yields from 61-99% of
      cross-benzoin products were obtained with a range of aliphatic aldehydes (Scheme 55).

            One example of application of NHC catalysis to the biomass transformation is the
      synthesis of 5,5ʹ-dihydroxymethyl furoin (DHFM) from 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (5-HMF).
      Indeed, 5-HMF is an interesting bio-based platform that is synthesized via the dehydration of
      fructose.200 This compound was used as a key intermediate for the preparation of new
      surfactants or bio-polymers.201,202 The benzoin condensation of HMF in the presence of ionic
      liquid or triazolium salt gave DHMF as a potential monomer. This reaction required a certain
      amount of catalyst (1 mol%) in green solvents such as water or ethanol and provided a
      quantitative yield for the desired product (DHMF). Moreover, this derivative could be
      hydrogenated via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) process at high temperature to give a mixture of
      premium hydrocarbon fuels (Scheme 56, route a).203 Otherwise, DHMF could be reduced or
      oxidized to polyol substrates which could be useful for the preparation of polyurethanes or
      polyesters (Scheme 56, route b and c).204-205

       4.1.2     Stetter reaction
            The Stetter reaction, first reported in 1976, is the addition of an aldehyde onto a Michael
       acceptor in the presence of free carbene.206 In comparison with the benzoin condensation that
       involves a 1,2-addition, the Stetter reaction involves the attachment of an acyl anion
       equivalent to a Michael acceptor, leading to 1,4-dicarbonyl derivatives that make the reaction
       irreversible, contrary to the benzoin condensation. The first intramolecular Stetter reaction
       was reported by Ciganek et al.207 using a thiazolium catalyst and a good yield of cylic product
       was obtained with salicylic aldehyde derivative. To obtain a high enantioselectivity, a chiral
       triazolium catalyst was developed by Rovis et al., then an excellent yield and enantiomeric
       excess were achieved (Scheme 57).208

         the presence of both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes with a range of Michael acceptors
         such as vinyl phosphonates, vinyl sulfones or nitroolefin derivatives.209,210 It was clearly seen
         that Stetter reaction performed well with aromatic aldehydes. On the contrary, the Stetter
         process with aliphatic aldehydes gave only moderate yields. An important difference
         between these two families of aldehydes is based on the reactivity of α-hydroxyketone
         products. On the one hand, the retro-benzoin condensation occurs with aromatic substrates
         at room temperature, leading to an equilibrium between D-hydroxyketone and aldehydes.
         On the other hand, high temperatures are required to accelerate the retro-benzoin
         condensation of aliphatic α-hydroxyketones.211

                In order to circumvent the generation of self-benzoin condensation products, symmetric
         vicinal diketones were used as acyl anion precursors. The work, pioneered by Massi et al.,
         then continued by Yoshida et al. indicated that a good yield could be achieved with short
         chain diketones or cyclic diketones.212 However, a limitation was observed with long chain
         diacyl substrates (Scheme 58).

             213
       et al.      This consecutive reaction employs glucose as the formyl surrogate in the presence of a
       thiazolium catalyst under microwaves irradiation. The key step of this process involves the
       retrobenzoin condensation of glucose to give formaldehyde equivalents. This nucleophilic
       formyl group could react with chalcones to give E-formyl ketones with high yields (up to 83%).

       4.1.3     Transesterification
            The transesterification using imidazolium catalyst was developed independently by the
       group of Nolan and an other group supervised by Hendrick and Waymouth. In 2002, Nolan et
       al. reported that the transesterification of methyl acetate or vinyl acetate with simple primary
       alcohols such as benzyl alcohol or geraniol in the presence of IMes or ICy provided good yields
       of the desired products (93-99% yield) (Scheme 60).214 At the same time, Hendrick and
       Waymouth also described the transesterification of methyl benzoate with an excess of alcohol
       (20 equiv) in the presence of an imidazolylidene catalyst.215 A range of alcohols including
       primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols, was also investigated and the transesterification was
       performed well with primary alcohols. However, a slight decrease of reactivity was observed
       with secondary alcohols and no transesterification products were obtained with tertiary
       alcohols, indicating the limitation of this method. To deeper understand the mechanism of this
       process, a computational work by Hu et al. showed that the reaction was not passing through
       the Breslow intermediate.216 The key of this transesterification involves the formation of
       imidazolylidene species with the Brӧnsted-base, then leads to a zwitterionic intermediate. It
       was also shown that NHC facilitates the proton transfer from the alcohol to leaving group,
       without ionization of the intermediate.

       be reacted with other nucleophilic agents to afford the desired products. One of the typical
       examples is the NHC-catalysed oxidative esterification of aldehydes to corresponding esters.217
       This reaction employs a simple triazolium catalyst and MnO2 as an external oxidant. Both of
       aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes are employed for this oxidative process and good
       yields of desired carboxylates are obtained (>90%), indicating the efficiency of the oxidative
       methods (Scheme 61).

              CHAPTER II: PREPARATION OF D-HYDROXYKETONES


1. State of art for the preparation of fatty D-hydroxyketones
      Vegetable oil derivatives are key intermediates for bio-transformations of biomass. Some of them
are directly converted to bio-diesel which is considered as an alternative fuel. Next to this, a lot of
attempts were done to valorize this family of compounds to higher added-value such as epoxidized
vegetable oils (EVOs) for plasticizers, biosourced diols for polymers, etc. Among them, D-
hydroxyketone is an interesting functional group. However, the synthesis of these substrates was
underexploited on fatty derivatives. Actually, there are a few routes to prepare this kind of
compounds such as benzoin condensation,218 acyloin condensation,219-220 rubottom oxidation,221
oxidation of ketone derivatives,222 etc (Scheme 62).

       However, most of these methods could not be applied to the synthesis D-hydroxyketones
derived from vegetable oils. In this context, only methodologies to prepare fatty D-ketol derivatives
will be presented.

       1.1 Oxidation of alkene
       In an early report, a method was developed by Holde and Marcusson then King using KMnO4
“neutral” to oxidize oleic acid 1 to 9(10)-hydroxy 10(9)-oxooctadecanoic acid 2a and 2b. However,
this method has worked in very high diluted conditions (1 g/l) with a low yield (30%).223-224 This work
was also re-investigated by Swern et al.225 Swern found that 45% yield of a 1:1 mixture of two
regioisomers 2a and 2b were always afforded even if the pH was controlled or not. Moreover, the
best yield (70%) of D-hydroxyketones was obtained when the pH of the medium was controlled
between 9.0 and 9.5 using a solution of phosphate buffer (Scheme 63).

      More recently, Plietker developed a mild condition for ketohydroxylation of olefin using RuO4 as
a catalyst.226-227 This method was performed in a mixture of solvents (EtOAc/CH3CN/H2O) at room
temperature using an excess of oxone as an oxidant to give an excellent yield of D-hydroxyketone
derivatives (up to 94% for aromatic subtrates) (Scheme 64). However, oxone is a strong oxidant and a
very exothermic agent, then it could be probably a problem to upscale the reaction. Moreover, no
fatty acid derivatives has been tested by the authors.

      1.2 Opening of epoxide
      Epoxidized fatty compounds are interesting derivatives for synthesis of D-ketol oleochemicals. A
study by Brousse and Lefort showed that 65% yield of hydroxyketone derivatives 12a and 12b can be
obtained by oxidative ring-opening of epoxidized methyl oleate 3 in the presence of a Lewis acid as
BF3.Et2O, using DMSO as an oxidant (Scheme 65).228 However, this method generates dimethyl sulfide
as a co-product which is madolorous and toxic gas. Recently, this work was repeated by Deruer et
al.229 However, only 42% of the fatty ketols 12a and 12b was reported, indicating that this method
suffers from a lack of reproductivity.

             CHAPTER II: PREPARATION OF D-HYDROXYKETONES

A similar study was reported to synthesize D-ketol fatty acids. However, a low yield was obtained,
with the concomitant formation of the corresponding diols (18-30% yield) as unwanted products.230

      1.3 Monoreduction of diketone:
      Another strategy to access fatty D-hydroxyketones is the monoreduction of vicinal diketones.231
Actually, there are two main pathways to access 1,2-diketones: 1) oxidation of vicinal diols with NBS
or 2) oxidation of a fatty alkynoic acid (Scheme 66). Among two of them, route 1 is more preferable
because dihydroxylated compound is easy to synthesis and circumvents with the use of toxic agents
such as bromide or NaNH2. Then, the vicinal diketone was reduced to corresponding D-ketols 2a and
2b using Zinc in AcOH to obtain the desired products with a high yield (88%). However, this method
suffers from the formation of a large quantity of metal waste and a lack of selectivity.

      1.4 Mono-oxidation of diol
      There are a variety of methods to oxidize 1,2-diols to D-hydroxyketone derivatives. In an early
work, Fétizon et al. reported that a cylic diol subtrate such as cyclohexane-1,2-diol could be
converted into corresponding D-ketol using an excess of silver carbonate with a moderate yield
(41%).232 This phenomenon was explained by the formation of overoxidation products (vicinal
diketones). More recently, several oxidation systems were reported to promote this reaction such as
NaBrO3/NaHSO3,233 KBrO3/KHSO4,234 dioxirane.235 However, most of them are used in a stoichiometric
amount. Besides, a few catalytic oxidation methods were developed based on RuO4-oxone,236
boronic acid-dibromoisocyanuric acid,237 Pd-benzoquinone.238 They usually exhibit a good selectivity
for desired product. However, they generate large amount of waste and the scope is quite limited. In
most cases, they gave good yields with aromatic derivatives and short linear chain subtrates.
However, no example was reported with fatty compounds such as the diol derived from oleic acid.

            CHAPTER II: PREPARATION OF D-HYDROXYKETONES

     In the literature, there is only one paper describing the mono-oxidation of fatty substrates. The
diol derived from oleic acid 6 was oxidized to the corresponding ketols 2a and 2b using N-Bromo
succinimide (NBS) as an oxidant (Scheme 67).231 However, the desired products were only obtained
with 63% yield (Scheme 66), due to the formation of an inevitable by-product (1,2-diketone).
Moreover, the reaction involving NBS is highly exothermic and the reaction generates a large amount
of chemical waste, leading to a difficult purification process.




                             Scheme 67: Synthesis of fatty D-ketol from fatty vicinal diol

        Until now, the mono-oxidation of fatty vicinal diols to corresponding ketols is quite under-
investigated. In this context, the development of an efficient method to obtain this family of
compounds is highly desired.



2. Mono-oxidation of vicinal diols

    2.1 Waymouth’s work
    Recently, Waymouth et al. have reported a method for the selective oxidation of glycerol 7 to
dihydroxyacetone (DHA) 8 using a complex between Pd(OAc)2 and neocuproine as catalyst and
benzoquinone (3 equiv) as an oxidant under ambient temperature.238 This method gave a good
conversion (>97%) and excellent selectivity (99%) towards the formation of DHA (Scheme 68).

             CHAPTER II: PREPARATION OF D-HYDROXYKETONES

      This strategy was also applied for unprotected carbohydrate derivatives and exhibits good
results with many advantages such as a low catalyst loading and excellent conversion.239 However,
the selectivity of the desired products was lower than for glycerol. This phenomenon could be
explained by the presence of many secondary alcohols. The formation of 3-ketose 10a was the major
product (88%) (Scheme 69). However, the generation of 4-ketose 10b was also formed (8%) as an
inevitable co-product.




                             Scheme 69: Selective oxidation of unprotected carbohydrates

      Herein, Waymouth et al. have developed a mild condition for selective mono-oxidation of
polyols. The reaction was carried out for both carbohydrates and simple polyols and provided good
yields of desired products. However, some drawbacks still exist such as the use of oxidants. On the
one hand, benzoquinone could generate a large amount of hydroquinone that renders the
purification process more difficult. On the other hand, the use of a greener oxidant such O2 could
lead to the formation of over-oxidation products or the oxidation of the ligand. Moreover, no
example for unactivated fatty 1,2-diol was given by the authors.

      2.2 Preliminary results 240-241
      Inspired by Waymouth’s study,238 we first attempted the selective mono-oxidation of diol 11
under their optimized conditions (5 mol% Pd-neocuproine complex, 3 equiv benzoquinone, CH3CN or
DMSO, rt). However, no D-hydroxyketone was obtained, probably due to the lack of solubility of diol
11. Then, the reaction conditions were reinvestigated, using oxygen as a green oxidant. At the
beginning, the reaction was conducted in a sealed tube, using Pd(OAc)2-neocuproine (4 mol%),
oxygen (1 bar) in MeOH at 50°C for 3 hours. Under these conditions, the conversion reached 58%,
the selectivity of D-hydroxyketones 12 reached 93% and some black particles (Pd°) were observed
(Table 2, entry 1). Realizing that the pressure of oxygen gradually decreased as the reaction progress,
the reaction was next carried out in a stainless steel reactor using a constant pressure of oxygen (3

bar). Satisfyingly, the conversion was complete after 30 minutes (Table 2, entry 2). Similar results
(99% conversion, 89% selectivity) were also obtained using only 2 mol% of catalytic system. However,
the reation time was needed to extend (1.5 hours)(Table 2, entry 3). A further decrease in the
catalyst loading to 1 mol% did not allow the reaction to achieve complete conversion (Table 2, entry
4), then catalyst loading of 2 mol% was selected for next investigation.

      The oxidant was next probed for mono-oxidation of diol 11 under previous optimized conditions.
Excellent results (95% conversion, 99% selectivity) were obtained with benzoquinone (1 equiv) (Table
2, entry 5). However, this oxidant suffers from a formation of a large quantity of chemical waste
(hydroquinone). A green oxidant such as hydrogen peroxide (35% in H2O) was also investigated under
these conditions. A good result of 83% conversion and 91% selectivity was observed when H2O2 (1
equiv) was used (Table 2, entry 6). However, an increase of oxidant (H2O2, 2 equiv) did not affect the
selectivity but the conversion dramatically dropped to 26%, caused by the oxidation of methyl group
in neocuproine, affecting the structural integrity of the ligand and thus decreasing the rate of the
reaction (Table 2, entry 7).

      The use of basic or acidic additives was next investigated for monooxidation of diol 11. A good
selectivity (95%) toward the formation of D-hydroxyketone 12 was obtained in the presence of
AcONa (6 mol%) (Table 2, entry 8). However, the conversion declined to 75%. On the contrary, the
use of acid was rather surprising. Excellent results (95% conversion, 97% selectivity) were obtained
using AcOH (6 mol%) as an additive after 1.5 hours (Table 2, entry 9). Addition of some acetic acid is
beneficial to the reaction by preventing Palladium black formation and accelerating the reoxidation
of Pd(0) or Pd(II) peroxo to Pd(II) acetate species that is true ative species in this catalytic cycle
(Scheme 70).242 No better results (94% conversion, 94% selectivity) was observed in the presence of
AcOH (12 mol%) but extended reaction time (3 hours) was required in the case (Table 2, entry 10).
This is likely due to the addition of acetic acid hindering the initial deprotonation of diol 11.

      2.3 Scope for optimized conditions
              We have first developed an optimized condition for the mono-oxidation of fatty diol 11 to
      the corresponding D-hydroxyketones 12 using catalytic system Pd-neocuproine. These conditions
      were next applied to biomass substrates. However, these derivatives were not commercially
      available and need to be prepared on the multigram scale. The biosourced fatty-1,2 diols were
      synthesized from cheap and available substrates such as high-oleic sunflower oil, rapeseed oil or
      castor oil.

          2.3.1      Preparation of biosourced vicinal diols
          The diol 11 was prepared from the crude product (75% purity) diol oleic acid 6 supplied by
Oleon. This crude product was first crystallized in ethyl acetate to obtain the high-purity (98%) fatty
diol 6. Then this derivative was esterified in excess MeOH at 70°C in the presence of Amberlyst-15
(20 wt% compared to diol 6). After 14 hours, the reaction was complete and the desired product 11
was obtained in an excellent yield (95%) (Scheme 71).

               Scheme 71: General procedure for the preparation of fatty diol 11 from industrial crude products

           The fatty esters 14 and 16 were prepared by esterification of oleic acid 1 with n-butanol or 2-
ethylhexanol (in excess and solvents), using sulfuric acid as an acid catalyst and sodium sulfate as a
water scavenger. These reactions were heated at 130°C during 75 minutes and provided the
corresponding esters 14 and 16 in 75% and 90% yield, respectively. The t-butyl ester analogue could
not be synthesized by this method because of the steric hindrance and the low reactivity of tert-
butanol. Then, Mitsunobu esterification was applied in the presence of DCC and DMAP to give the
desired product 15 with 90% yield. All the 3 fatty esters 14, 15 and 16 were converted to their
corresponding epoxides 17, 18 and 19 using a reported process243 with quantitative yields (95-98%).
Finally, these epoxides were converted to the diol derivatives by hydrolysis in the presence of H3PO3
and water. The corresponding fatty diols 20, 21 and 22 were obtained with 92, 84 and 92% yield,
respectively (Scheme 72).

          The preparation of two symmetrical diols 26 and 29 were also considered. These compounds
could be synthesized by a similar route, starting from the self-metathesis products of methyl oleate.
However, these alkene intermediates were not commercially available and Grubbs catalyst is quite
expensive, then we decided to access these diols from convenient pathways. The diol diester 26 was
synthesized by a similar pathway from octadecenedioic acid (O.D.A) 23 (80% purity, supplied by
Oleon). Firstly, the diacid 23 was converted to the corresponding fatty diester 24 in the presence of
Amberlyst-15 in the excess of MeOH. Then, the epoxidation of this derivative was conducted in a
mixture of HCOOH and H2O2, followed by hydrolysis of fatty oxirane 25 in the presence of H3PO3 to
give the desired fatty diol 26 with high yields (Scheme 73).

         The second symmetric diol 29 was prepared by a two-step synthesis. First, benzoin
condensation of nonanal 27 was conducted at 80°C using a thiazolium salt as a catalyst in the
presence of triethyl amine244 and gave the corresponding D-hydroxyketone 28 with 73% yield. Then,
this substrate was reduced under hydrogen pressure (10 bar) using a certain amount of Ru/C (5 wt%)
to afford the desired product with 95% yield (Scheme 74).

         In order to prepare the diol 32 derived from methyl erucate that represents 40% of the
composition of rapeseed oil, another strategy was applied (Scheme 75). Firstly, the methanolysis of
rapeseed oil was conducted using K3PO4 in methanol to give a mixture of methyl fatty esters
including methyl palmitate, methyl oleate, methyl linoleate and methyl erucate. Then, the more
volatile oleochemicals were removed by fractional distillation under vacuum to give a residue
containing more than 88% of methyl erucate 30 (94%). The epoxidation of this fatty ester was carried
out in the presence of performic acid, following by ring-opening of epoxide 31 to give the desired
product 32 in high yields.

           To broaden the scope, two fatty diols 38 and 39 derived from castor oil were synthesized. On
the one hand, the fatty ester 34 was prepared via methylation of methyl ricinoleate 33. However, a
traditional pathway using NaH/MeI did not give the desired compound. Then, a new method using
trimethyl phosphate and Aquivion PW98245 was applied to prepare the fatty substrate 34 in a good
yield (90%). On the other hand, methyl 12-O-Acyl ricinoleate (80% purity) was purchased from T.C.I
chemicals then distillated under reduced pressure to give 12-O-Acyl derivative 35 with 98% purity.
Both of O-Me and O-Acyl derivatives were then converted to the corresponding epoxides 36 and 37
with 98% and 87%, that were converted to fatty diols 38 and 39 in high yields (93-98%) (Scheme 76).

            The tetraol derived from methyl linoleate was next synthesized. The epoxidation of methyl
linoleate 40 (95% purity) was carried out using performic acid to give diepoxide methyl linoleate 41 in
excellent yield (95%). Then, the hydrolysis of oxirane substrate was conducted at 90°C in the
presence of H3PO3 (2 mol%). After 3 hours, the quantitative conversion was observed but no tetraol
product was reported, due to the formation of cyclic tetrahydrofuran derivatives 42a and 42b via
intramolecular cyclisation of intermediate 43 (Scheme 77).

            To further increase the scope, a bis-diol was synthesized from methyl oleate and ethylene
glycol. Firstly, the transesterification of methyl oleate 44 was conducted in excess of ethylene glycol
at 120°C, catalyzed by para-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) to give a mixture of glycol oleate 45 (75%)
and dioleate glycol 46 (20%).246 Then, an equivalent of methyl oleate was added in this mixture and
the crude was heated at 120°C in acidic condition (PTSA, 10 mol%) to accelerate the second
transesterification. After 14 hours, the conversion was complete and the glycol dioleate 46 was
isolated through column chromatography with an overall yield of 70%. This fatty substrate was
epoxidized by HCOOH/H2O2 to give the bis-epoxide 47, that was converted to the bis-diol 48 in a high
yield (95%) (Scheme 78)

        Finally, to investigate the activity of the catalytic system with raw renewable materials, a tris-
diol 51 derived from high-oleic sunflower oil was synthesized. First of all, the sunflower oil containing
more than 85% oleic moiety 49 was epoxidized using catalytic system of HCOOH/H2O2/H2SO4. This
reaction was performed with a good conversion and selectivity to give epoxidized sunflower oil 50
(80% epoxide functionality). The rest of the mixture contains the saturated fatty derivatives and
some of monoketones. Then, this intermediate was converted to vegetable oil derivatives 51
containing more than 70% of tris-diol (Scheme 79).

        In conclusion, we have developed robust conditions for the synthesis of fatty diols. Even if
this reaction involves to a two-step synthesis but this procedure is simple, using the common and
cheap catalyst as well as easy to upscale. Moreover, this reaction condition was applied to form 12
vegetable oil derivatives with 69-95% yields.

      2.3.2      The scope for the mono-oxidation of 1,2-diols to D-ketols
      The scope for the mono-oxidation of fatty vicinal diols was initially conducted with diol 11. The
reaction was performed in an autoclave at 50°C with 2 mol% of Pd(OAc)2 and neocuproine in the
presence of AcOH (6 mol%) in the continuous pressure of oxygen (3 bar). After 1.5 hour, the
conversion was nearly complete (95%) and an excellent selectivity was also obtained (Ketol/Diketone
= 97/3). The desired D-hydroxyketone 12 was isolated with 80% after column chromatography (Table
3, entry 1). Then, this condition was applied to diols 20 and 21 derived from n-butyl and t-butyl
oleate. Treatment of diol 20 under optimized condition gave D-hydroxyketone 52 with an excellent
selectivity (95%) between ketol and diketone products, and the product 52 was isolated with 75%
isolated yield (Table 3, entry 2). A similar result was observed with diol 21. A full conversion was
obtained and fatty D-ketol 53 was isolated in 78% yield (Table 3, entry 3). Then, diol 22 was
successfully converted and a good yield (78%) of corresponding D-hydroxyketone 54 was achieved
(Table 3, entry 4).

      Two symmetrical diols 29 and 26 were next catalytically oxidized under optimized conditions.
The quantitative conversion was observed with diol 29 and the corresponding D-ketol 28 was
isolated with 84% yield (Table 3, entry 5). On the contrary, the conversion of diol 26 only reached
75% after 1.5 hours although 92% selectivity of desired product was provided and the desired
product 55 was obtained with 61% yield (Table 3, entry 6). For the conversion of diol 32 originated

from rapeseed oil, a full conversion was observed and 72% of D-hydroxyketone 56 was afforded
(Table 3, entry 7).

      Another biosourced diol 38 which was derived from methyl ricinoleate, was also investigated.
Under optimized conditions, 70% of fatty ketol 57 was isolated as a mixture of 4 isomers with a ratio
of = 25:18:21:36 (Table 3, entry 8) (Scheme 80).

      Then, our catalytic system was tested with challenging substrates such as 48, 59 and 51. For
oleochemical diol 48, un-complete conversion was reported when only 2 mol% of the catalyst was
used. A mixture of products was detected after isolating each fraction by column chromatography,
including bis-diol, diol-ketol, bis-ketol, ketol-diketone and bis-diketone. Then, the monooxidation of
48 was conducted in the presence of Pd-neocuproine (3 mol%) to get a better result. However, only
20% of bis-ketol was isolated and ketol-diol 59 was separated as a major product. Finally, the
reaction was carried out in the presence of Pd-neocuproine (4 mol%). A complete conversion was
observed after 2.5 hours and 50% of bis-ketol 58 was achieved (Table 3, entry 9). This phenomenon
could be explained by the low solubility of bis-diol 48 in MeOH even at 50°C. In order to compare the
reactivity of two functional groups, the compound 59 was evaluated in the adjusted condition. After
2.5 hours, 85% conversion was observed and 75% of ketol functionality was identified by NMR
analysis. However, only 42% yield of the desired bis-ketol was isolated after purification (Table 3,
entry 10). Finally, this catalytic system was employed for high-oleic sunflower oil derivative 51
containing at least 70% diol. The catalytic amount was calculated based on the percentage of diol
detected by 1H-NMR. This fatty diol was fully converted and 90% of selectivity of ketol 60 was
observed by 1H-NMR (Table 3, entry 11). It proved that this catalytic system is stable, versatile and
applicable to oleochemical derivatives including raw renewable substrates such as sunflower oil.

                  CHAPTER II: PREPARATION OF D-HYDROXYKETONES
 a
      Reaction conditions: 30-mL stainless steel reactor, 12 mmol of 1,2-diol, Pd(OAc)2 (2 mol%), neocuproine (2 mol%), AcOH (6 mol%), O2
 (3 bar), MeOH (8 mL), 50°C, 1.5 hour. b Conversion and selectivity were determined by 1H NMR. c Isolated yield after purification by
 column chromatography; d 4 %mol of catalyst was used; DK = 1,2-diketone


       2.3 Conclusion

             Herein, we first developed a mild method for mono-oxidation of biosourced fatty diols to
       approach α-hydroxyketones with several advantages such as high conversion and selectivity, low
       catalyst loading, using a green oxidant and cheap solvent (O2 and MeOH) as well as feasibility to
       upscale. However, the price of catalyst was still expensive and the recyclability of homogenous
       catalyst was also a great challenge. Then, there was a demand for finding a complementary
       methodology using a heterogenous catalyst which could be recycled.



3. Dehydrogenation of vicinal diols

       3.1 Dehydrogenation process
             The dehydrogenation is an important reaction in organic synthesis involving the removal of
        hydrogen. It could be applied to convert alkane or saturated derivatives in nature to olefin
        derivatives which are more useful and valuable for chemical process. One of the typical example
        is the dehydrogenation of ethyl benzene to styrene, that is a precursor for synthesis of
        polystyrene, using iron oxide as a catalyst.247 However, this process is highly endothermic. Then,
        it works at high temperature (often more than 200oC) and suffers from a lack of selectivity
        between competitive reactions such hydrogenation, dehydration and C-C cleavage.

             An α-hydroxyketone derivative could be obtained from the corresponding diol which could
        be easily accessed via ring-opening of epoxide or dihydroxylation of olefin, by a dehydrogenation
        process. However, this kind of reaction is quite underexploited. Until now, there have been a few
        reports to synthesize an α-ketol from a vicinal diol. In an early report, Molnar and Bartok have
        developed a method using copper as a catalyst at 300°C for the preparation of 2-hydroxy
        cyclohexanone.248 However, only 86% conversion and 51% selectivity were obtained (Scheme 81,
        condition a). Later, Tomishige et al. found that the same transformation could be done using Ir-
        ReOx/SiO2 catalyst under milder conditions (220°C, 10 bar Argon, in water).249 However, only 37%
        conversion and 69% selectivity were achieved (Scheme 81, condition b), caused by consecutive
        reactions to form a lot of unwanted products such as cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol.

           In this context, we would like to develop a methodology to synthesize fatty α-ketols from
       vicinal biosourced diols by dehydrogenation using a metal-based heterogeneous catalyst under
       solvent-free conditions without any hydrogen scavenger (Scheme 82). Methyl 9,10-
       dihydroxyoctadecanoate 11 was chosen as a model substrate because of its avaibility and typical
       characteristic of oleochemical compounds.

        3.2 Nature of the dehydrogenation catalyst
           First, a series of commercially available heterogenous catalysts was investigated under
       solvent-free conditions. The reaction was performed at 160°C in a sealed tube under an argon
       atmosphere (Table 4). Using Palladium-based catalyst, no conversion was observed whatever the
       nature of the support (SiO2, Al2O3 or BaSO4) (Table 4, entries 1-3). A similar trend was also
       obtained with platinum supported on silica (Table 4, entry 4). However, the results with
       Ruthenium catalyst were quite promising. Ruthenium on charcoal gave 20% conversion and 35%
       selectivity while 45% conversion and 29% selectivity were achieved with ruthenium on alumina
       (Table 4, entries 5-6). Furthermore, when ruthenium hydroxide on alumina, mainly developed by
       Mizuno,250 was used, the conversion reached 50% with 60% selectivity (Table 4, entry 7). It could
       be explained by a better coordination of the ruthenium cation (in Mizuno’s catalyst) and the fatty
       diol. Moreover, increase the catalyst loading of Mizuno catalyst to 5 mol% gained a slightly of
       conversion (62%) with the same selectivity (64%) of desired products (Table 4, entry 8). Finally,
       the blank experiment with only alumina gave the poor result (Table 4, entry 9), confirming the
       crucial role of ruthenium even if there have been dispartities between different supports. This
       screening of heterogenous catalyst showed that ruthenium-based catalysts are the best
       candidates for investigation this kind of transformation. Consequently, only ruthenium-based
       catalysts were used for further investigation.

3.3 Dehydrogenation using heterogeneous ruthenium-based catalysts
        At the beginning of our investigation, the reaction was carried out in a sealed tube for the
   selection of the best catalysts for dehydrogenation (Table 4). However, the maximum
   conversion was only 62% due to the equilibrium between dehydrogenation and hydrogenation
   in the presence of ruthenium catalyst. To favor the dehydrogenation process, some strategies
   could be applied, such as using some hydrogen scavengers. However, when 1-octene, 4-vinyl
   anisole or 1,2-divinyl benzene were used, the results were not improved, due to the partial
   polymerization of vinyl derivatives or isomerization of terminal alkene at high temperature, that
   are less prone to be reduced, thus limiting the trap of H2.

        Another strategy is the liberation of hydrogen under reduced pressure which is better than
   using hydrogen scavengers especially in the view of atom economy (Table 5). First, the reaction
   was carried out in a schlenk tube connecting with an evaporator (for controlling the pressure).
   Then, the diol 11 was heated at 170°C in the presence of Ru(OH)x/Al2O3 (5 mol%) under vacuum
   pressure (5 mbar). Satisfyingly, 78% conversion and 90% selectivity of the desired product were
   achieved after 8 hours (Table 5, entry 1). In that case, monoketone derivatives 61a and 61b

                  CHAPTER II: PREPARATION OF D-HYDROXYKETONES

         were formed as by-products by dehydration. Increasing the temperature to 180°C, the
         conversion improved to 91%, but on the opposite side, the selectivity declined to 75% by the
         formation of dehydration and C-C cleavage by-products (Table 5, entry 2). Another factor that
         was investigated is the loading of heterogenized catalyst. The reaction gave 83% conversion and
         84% selectivity in the presence of 10 mol% of Ru(OH)x/Al2O3 at 170°C (Table 5, entry 3). A similar
         result was obtained with 10 mol% catalyst at 180°C for 6 hours (89% conv, 83% sel) (Table 5,
         entry 4). Furthermore, Ru/Al2O3 was used under the typical conditions. At 170°C, 70%
         conversion and 99% selectivity were recorded in the presence of 5 mol% catalyst after 8 hours
         (Table 5, entry 5). A better performance was achieved with ruthenium on charcoal (80% conv,
         93% sel) (Table 5, entry 6). However, during all these experiments, the mass balance remained
         at only 90%. This phenomenon could be explained by generation of volatile C-C cleavage
         products that were removed under vacuum. To circumvent this issue, the pressure was
         controlled at 100 mbar. When the reaction was repeated, the same results were obtained but
         with only a 3% mass loss, which is acceptable for this kind of reaction at high temperature using
         a heterogeneous catalyst. Then, the dehydrogenation reaction of diol 11 was re-investigated
         under this pressure.

                 To deeper understand the dehydrogenation process, the kinetics of the reaction was next

        a schlenk tube and the reaction was carried out at 175°C and at 100 mbar vacuum pressure. After
        11 hours, the reaction provided 79% conversion and 70% GC yield of desired product 12 (Figure

5, blue and red curves). Interestingly, almost no conversion was observed after 4 hours.
However, the conversion was dramatically rised to 70% between 4 and 6 hours. It seems that the
reaction requires some time to activate the catalyst. For this reason, commercially-available
ruthenium on alumina was activated under atmostpheric hydrogen at 170°C for 1 hour.
Surprisingly, 70% conversion and 62% GC yield of products 12 were observed after only 6 hours.
Two types of Ru/C with different specific area were next applied to this strategy. The result was
even better with activated 5 wt%-Ru/C (S= 500m2/g). 93% of conversion and 82% GC yield of 12
were achieved after 4 hours. Furthermore, the dehydrogenation with activated 5%w-Ru/C (Escat
4401, S= 900 m2/g) represented 90% conversion and 79% GC yield after 2 hours. Extending the
time to 3 hours led to a complete conversion (97%) but the selectivity declined rapidly to 75%,
mainly caused by the generation of undesired ketone 13 (21%). Finally, activated 5 wt%-Ru/C (S=
500m2/g) was selected for scope of dehydrogenation of fatty diol derivatives.

3.4     Scope for dehydrogenation of fatty biosourced diols
   The scope for the dehydrogenation of fatty diols was investigated under optimized conditions
in the presence of activated Ru/C (5 mol%) at 175°C (neat, vacuum pressure = 100 mbar, 3 hours)
(Table 6). The diol 11 derived from methyl oleate provided 91% conversion and 87% selectivity of
corresponding D-ketol (Table 6, entry 1). After purification on column chromatography, 67% of
the desired compound 12 was achieved. Diols with longer chain such as butyl and 2-ethyl hexyl

               CHAPTER II: PREPARATION OF D-HYDROXYKETONES

       esters 20 and 22 were also examined and gave good conversions (71-75%) and good selectivities
       (89-92%) (Table 6, entries 2-3). Then, diol tert-butyl ester 21 was next investigated under
       optimized conditions. In the presence of activated Ru/C, a quantitative conversion of 21 was
       observed but no desired product was detected by 1H-NMR (Table 6, entry 4). This phenomenon
       could be explained by the acidity of charcoal support. According to Park’s study,251 tert-butyl
       ester could be easily cleaved under microwave-irradiation in the presence of SiO2 at 120°C. That
       is the reason why degradation of diol 21 occurs at high temperature (175°C) in the presence of
       acidic supported such as charcoal, to release of 1-butene and a mixture of un-wanted products
       62a and 62b. To avoid the de-tert-butylation, activated Ru/Al2O3 was used and a lower
       conversion (40%) was observed but the selectivity of the desired product 63 still remained at
       88% (Table 6, entry 5).

           The protocol was subjected to symmetrical diols 25 and 26, which were derived from the
       self-metathesis product of methyl oleate. Excellent conversions (93-94%) and good selectivitiy
       (85-81%) were achieved (Table 6, entries 6-7). Diol 32 originated from rapeseed oil was also
       probed for dehydrogenation reaction. After 3 hours, the reaction gave 85% conversion and 81%
       selectivity of the corresponding D-ketol 56 (Table 6, entry 8). To broaden our scope, diol 39 from
       methyl ricinoleate was next investigated. Although quantitative conversion was observed, no
       desired product was obtained but cylic THF derivatives 64a and 64b were isolated with 60% yield
       as a 2:1 mixture of two diastereoisomers (Table 6, entry 9). In fact, a 1,5-migration of acetyl
       group was accelerated in diol 39 in the presence of acidic support such as charcoal, then this
       intermediate could be converted to THF derivatives via dehydrative intramolecular cyclisation
       (Scheme 83). A similar compound (with free OH) was recently reported by Werner et al. when
       attempting to synthesize a cyclic carbonate from methyl ricinoleate,252 then supporting our
       hypothesis.

            Finally, to evaluate the robust catalytic system, tris-diol 51 derived from sunflower oil was
       investigated under dehydrogenation conditions. After 6 hours, 50% conversion and 84%
       selectivity were observed for the corresponding D-ketol 60, confirming that this method could be

      3.5 Recycling of heterogeneous catalyst Ru/C
        The recycling of heterogeneous Ru/C catalyst was investigated with model substrate 11. First, the
        Ru/C catalyst was activated under hydrogen atmostphere at 175°C for 1h. Then, the catalyst and
        diol 11 were introduced into a schlenk tube and heated at 175°C. The reaction was carried out
        under a vacuum pressure of 100 mbar for 3 hours. After the first run, 90% conversion and 88%
        selectivity of desired products 12 were achieved. This data is quite close from those previously
        reported (Table 6, entry 1), confirming the reproducibility of the method. After the reaction, the
        catalyst was filtered, washed (EtOAc) and dried at 120°C under vacuum. This catalyst was also re-
        activated under hydrogen pressure at 175°C for 1 hour before re-using for a next run.




                                             Figure 6: Recycling of heterogeneous catalyst Ru/C

             In a second run, the conversion declined to 70% but selectivity remained at 88% under the
        same condition. Another test was done without re-activation of the catalyst. In that case, only
        60% conversion was observed, showing that, it is important to re-activate the catalyst before
        each run. The recovered catalyst was reused for 4 consecutive cycles and the results showed that
        the conversion and selectivity remained at 70% and 90%, respectively. The lost of conversion
        between first run and second run may be caused by leaching of Ru species. However, it seems
        unlikely because the filtrate did not show any activity. Another explaination could be the change
        of the oxidation state of Ru/C during the dehydrogenation process. According to Vlachos’s
        study,253 the oxidation state of Ru/C would change toward the loss of Ru4+ species during
        hydrogenation or dehydrogenation process, which might benefits to the formation of ruthenium

           Among two of them, hydride elimination is the rate-limiting step.254 To confirm the crucial
       role of Rux+ for the dehydrogenation process, a commercially-available Ru/C was completely
       reduced in continuous flow of hydrogen at 300°C for 10 hours and the resulting catalyst was also
       activated in a schlenk tube before investigating under optimized conditions. However, only 70%
       conversion and 89% selectivity were obtained. To fully understand the activation/deactivation of
       this catalyst, a deeper study will be necessary.



4.         Conclusion
           We have developed two methods for the preparation of D-hydroxyketone derivatives from
      fatty diols. The homogeneous pathway with Pd(OAc)2 and neocuproine displayed a lot of
      advantages such as a low catalyst loading, green oxidant and solvent, low temperature as well as
      excellent conversion (95%) and selectivity (97%) after a short reaction time. However, the
      recycling of homogeneous catalyst is also great challenge and the deactivation led to a decrease
      the catalyst life-time. On the contrary, activated Ru/C was the best candidate for the
      dehydrogenation process. High conversion (91%) and good selectivity (88%) was achieved when
      the reaction was carried out at 175°C (p =100 mbar) for 3 hours in the presence of activated Ru/C
      (5 mol%). Moreover, it could be reused for 5 cycles with a constant selectivity. Both these two
      methods were applied for a variety of fatty substrates to synthesize a range of fatty D-
      hydroxyketones which could be cleaved to aldehydes, acids or further functionalized.

1. Retro-benzoin condensation: State of the art
      Benzoin condensation is a well-known reaction for C-C formation in organic synthesis.194 It was
      used for the preparation of (chiral) D-hydroxyketone derivatives which could be converted to
      heterocyclic compounds or other key intermediates for applications in pharmaceuticals or
      polymer industry. However, the reverse reaction that is the cleavage of D-hydroxyketones to the
      corresponding aldehydes, namely retro-benzoin condensation, is underexploited. As can seen
      from figure 7, the number of reports related to retro-benzoin condensation is very limited in
      comparison with the high amount of studies about benzoin condensation.255




Figure 7: Comparison of the number of articles between benzoin and retro-benzoin condensation

           Actually, few studies have been reported about the retro-benzoin condensation which could
be seen as a bio-inspired approach. Enzymatic routes are one of the interesting pathways for bio-
transformation. They bring a lot of advantages such as high reactivity, ambient temperature and
water as a green solvent. However, some drawbacks might limit the application of these catalysts.
For instance, the loss or reduction of activity of the catalytic system could be observed. Moreover,
the disadvantages of enzymatic system should be considered such as substrate-dependence, not
working at high temperature (often less than 80°C) and high cost of the process. However, enzymatic
catalysis plays a crucial role in the transformation of biomass because it is closely associated with the
biosynthetic or the biodegradation pathways of these renewable materials. Furthermore, a reaction
catalyzed by enzymatic system is usually very specific. In some cases, it is not easy to obtain this kind
of transformation by using a traditional chemical reaction. “Benzoin metathesis” of D-ribose and D-
xylulose catalyzed by transketolase (TK) is one of the typical examples (Scheme 85). Actually, TK is a
member of the thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme family that is related to the metabolism
of carbohydrates. In the presence of TK, D-ribose was selectively cleaved at C3-position through
retro-benzoin condensation to release D-glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde, then this C2-ketol
moiety was combinated with D-xylulose to generate D-sedoheptulose (C7) via benzoin

the process. But more importantly, the retro-benzoin condensation could occur in the presence of
Transketolase.

         From a chemical point of view, Miyashita et al. were the first pioneers to apply the retro-
benzoin condensation strategy to the synthesis of aromatic ketones from D-subtituted benzoin
(Scheme 86). 257 Indeed, the starting materials were prepared through a two-step synthesis: benzoin
condensation, then followed by nucleophilic substitution of alkyl or aryl halide in the presence of a
strong base. The retro-benzoin condensation was catalysed by cyanides (CN-) or imidazolium salts
(NHCs) to give the desired aromatic ketones with excellent yields (up to 98% for CN- and 87% for
NHCs). This phenomenon was explained by the formation of stable ketones, not recombining with
the aromatic aldehydes generated thus shifting the equilibrium. Furthermore, other NHC precursors
could be used for this transformation. For example, in the presence of 3,4,5-trimethyl thiazol-3-ium
iodide, a similar result (90% yield) was observed. However, this method has a low atom-economy for
the desired product and is limited to unactivated derivatives.

  CHAPTER III: CLEAVAGE OF α-HYDROXYKETONES TO ALDEHYDES

        Recently, Chi et al. have developed an efficient catalytic system for domino retro-benzoin
and Stetter reaction using a thiazolium salt (Scheme 87).213 Under microwave irradiation, glucose or
other carbohydrates could react with chalcones to give a E-formyl ketones in high yields, up to 83%.
Actually, the key step of this transformation is the retro-benzoin condensation of hexose. Actually,
glucose is in a equilibrium between its cyclic acetal and its acyclic aldehyde forms. The first step of
this domino reaction involves the retro-benzoin condensation of acyclic aldehyde in the presence of
thiazolylidence to release a C5-pentose and acyl thiazolium intermediate. This one-carbon
nucleophilic species was trapped by a strong Michael acceptor such as chalcone to give E-formyl
ketones, thus favoring the equilibrium due to irreversible character of the Stetter reaction.
Moreover, the pentose could undergo further iterative NHC-catalytic cycle to generate the acyl
thiazolium intermediate and other smaller carbohydrates. However, free aldehydes could not be
obtained through the use of these two methods.

        More recently, Duguet and Lemaire developed a method for the non-oxidative cleavage of D-
hydroxyketones derived from vegetable oils to fatty aldehydes (Scheme 88). 229 By investigation of a
series of azolium salts (imidazolium, thiazolium and triazolium), the authors showed that the retro-
benzoin condensation was best performed in the presence of thiazolium salts. Under microwave
irradiation, the retro-benzoin condensation of D-hydroxyketone using catalyst 3,4,5-trimethyl
thiazolium iodide (20 mol%), K2CO3 (20 mol%) gave 60% conversion and 40% of the desired
aldehydes, with the formation of 20% of the self-benzoin condensation products.

2. Retro-benzoin of D-hydroxyketones under microwave irradiation258
         Based on our initial results, the retro-benzoin condensation of D-hydroxyketone 12 was
investigated under microwave irradiation. From what we learn in our preliminary results, the retro-
benzoin was best performed in the presence of thiazolium salts. So, a range of thiazolium salts was
first screened as the pre-catalysts for the cleavage of D-ketol 12. Firstly, we screened a series of
commercially available thiazolium salts (Table 7). First, the D-ketol 12 was treated with thiamine
pyrophosphate (ThPP) 66, thiamine hydrochloride 67 and thiamine-derived thiazolium salt 68 in the
presence of K2CO3 at 150°C under microwave irradiation.

         Under these conditions, no conversion of D-hydroxyketone 12 was observed proving the
incapacity of these catalysts to promote the retro-benzoin reaction (Table 7, entries 1-3). This
phenomenon was explained by the degradation of these precatalysts. Indeed, thiazoliums 66-68 are
stable until about 200°C as salts.259 However, they could be easily decomposed at elevated
temperature (130-170°C) in basic medium at the methylene position, causing the degradation of
thiazolium salts to thiazole and pyrimidine or aryl moieties.260 Better results were obtained with
thiazolium salts 69, 70 and 71. On the one hand, 7% of conversion was observed with pre-catalyst 69
(Table 7, entry 4). On the other hand, 26% conversion was achieved with the precatalyst 70.
However, the selectivity of retro-benzoin products declined because of the generation of self-
benzoin condensation products (Table 7, entry 5). This result indicates that the steric hindrance of N-
alkyl chain could reduce the reactivity of the catalyst. Finally, when less bulky thiazolium salt 71 was
used, the conversion reached 39% and the two aldehydes were obtained in 29% yield, along with
10% yield of the self-benzoin products 28 and 55 (Table 7, entry 6), then this precatalyst was selected
for further optimization.

and EtOAc gave reasonable results with 18% and 15% conversion, respectively (Table 8, entries 2-3)
whereas small conversions (<5%) were achieved when retro-benzoin condensation was examined in
toluene or heptane (Table 8, entries 4-5). These results indicated that non-polar solvents were not
able to promote the retro-benzoin process. Some ethereal solvents such as THF, 2-Me-THF, MTBE or
DBE were tested but no positive result was observed (Table 8, entries 6-9). Finally, a saturated fatty
ester such as methyl stearate was used as a bio-based solvent but no conversion was achieved under
the standard condition and the starting material was recovered without any change.

          The catalyst loading was next studied at 150°C under standard condition with thiazolium 71

When the catalyst loading increased to 5 or 10 mol%, the better results were recorded with 23 and
33% conversion, respectively (Table 9, entries 2-3). However, by-products 28 and 55 were observed
with 4 and 6% yield, respectively. Expectedly, when the loading of thiazolium salt 71 increased 20
mol%, the conversion of 12 reached 39% and 29% yield of two aldehydes were achieved with 10% of
self-benzoin condensation products(Table 9, entry(Table 9, entry 4). No better result was observed
with 40 mol% of precatalyst, indicating that the reaction reached a plateau and there is an

         In conclusion, we have developed a non-oxidative cleavage method for preparation of bio-
aldehydes from fatty D-hydroxyketones, using a thiazolium salt 71 as a precatalyst under microwave
irradiation. The retro-benzoin process occurs at 170°C and gives a 60% conversion and 40% of
desired aldehydes after 1 hour. However, an equilibirium between benzoin and retro-benzoin
condensation is established, then provides 20% yield of self-benzoin condensation products as the
by-products. To shift this balance toward the formation of the aldehydes, some strategies were
proposed such as reactive distillation or using aldehyde scavengers, etc.



3. Reactive distillation
         In order to shift the equilibrium between benzoin condensation and retro-benzoin
condensation of fatty D-hydroxyketones, the reactive distillation process is applied. In fact, the
reactive distillation is a combination of chemical reaction and distillation with several advantages.261
Firstly, the reactive distillation technology is energy-saving process because two steps can be
combined and carried out in one device. Secondly, aldehyde selectivity could improve because the
fast removal of more volatile products (aldehydes) from reaction medium could avoid the formation
of two symmetrical D-hydroxyketones as well as the generation of other heavier by-products.
Moreover, retro-benzoin condensation is exo-thermic reaction and the reaction heat could be used
to evaporate part of surrounding liquid and help to distillation process more efficiently.

      3.1 Preliminary results262
          First, thiazolium salt 71 (10 mol%) was deprotonated in CH3CN in the presence of K2CO3 (10
mol%), then the resulting solution was transferred into a flask containing the D-hydroxyketone 12 (4g
, 12 mmol) and CH3CN was removed under reduced pressure. After that, the flask was heated at
180°C under vacuum pressure (p =4-6 mbar) (Scheme 89). Encouragingly, 1.4 g of the mixture of two

aldehydes (36 wt%) was collected. Furthermore, no improved result was obtained when reaction’s
time was extended to more than 3 hours. Then, both distillate and residue were analyzed by GC. On
the one hand, two aldehydes 27 and 65 were the major products in the distillate with the GC ratio
63:37. On the other hand, D-hydroxyketone 12 represented 95% as the major component in residue
and several heavy by-products with a small quantity such as 55 were also found inside this mixture.
However, there was a small peak observed on the GC chromatography (retention time =2.9 minute).
We hypothesized that the thiazolium salt 71 might be degraded under heating process. This proposal
was confirmed by injecting the thiazole species in the GC and the same retention time was recorded.

           Indeed, this phenomenon known as the retro-Menshutkin reaction was already observed
with some imidazolium salts.263-264 Under thermal conditions, the ionic liquids were dealkylated by a
strong nucleophilic agent such as halides, then the neutral imidazole species were released. In our
case, this process might be accelerated under vacuum. In fact, methyl iodide is a volatile agent and
was eliminated from system, thus leading to catalyst decomposition. Based on our knowledge, two
degradation pathways of the catalyst were proposed (Scheme 90). First, thiazolydene species could
be protonated back to thiazolium salt, then a nucleophilic agent could attack the N-alkyl group to
release neutral thiazole species and the corresponding methylated nucleophile. Secondly, incomplete
deprotonated thiazolium salt could directly decompose by nucleophilic substitution, then the C-N
bond could be cleaved to give thiazole and methyl iodide.

3.2       Synthesis of robust thiazolium salt265
         Structural modifications of the thiazolium salt were next studied to increase its stability
(Scheme 91). Two approaches have been envisaged: i) to increase the length chain or steric
hindrance of N-alkyl chain; ii) to decrease the nucleophilicity of couter-anion.




                           Scheme 91: Two strategies to increase the stability of thiazolium salts

           A first range of thiazolium salts was synthesized from of 4,5-dimethyl thiazole with a series of
alkyl halides (I-, Br-) or peudohalide (OTf-) (Scheme 92). The use of alkyl iodide gave thiazoliums 71-74
with good yields (>70%) even if the length chain was increased from C1 to C8 while thiazolium
bromides 76-77 were obtained with low yields. It might be caused by less reactive of alkylating agent
(isopropyl bromide) or a volatile and unstable agent (EtBr). In the case of thiazolium salt 78, 86% of
desired product was achieved since the reaction was performed under solvent-free conditions at
80°C with an excess of butyl bromide. Under these conditions, 5% of precatalyst 75 was observed as
by-product through elimination. Finally, the alkylation of thiazole with methyl triflate gave an
excellent yield (94%) of thiazolium salt 79.

           A second range of thiazolium salts was prepared by couter-anion exchange of substrate 71
using potassium or lithium salts of charge-delocalized anion (Scheme 93). The synthesis of thiazolium
80, 81 and 82 provided moderate isolated yields (57-67%). The thiazolium acetate 83 was also
prepared to have a basic counter-anion which could help to avoid the use of an external base for the
formation of the free-carbene. However, this product was decomposed quickly at room temperature.
Indeed, several reports mentioned that imidazolium carboxylates (in particular acetate) could
degrade rapidly at high temperature but these species were quite stable until 100-200°C. 266 But the
fact that thiazolium proton (pKa= 16.9 in DMSO) is more acidic than imidazolium proton (pKa = 21),
led to the degradation of thiazolium species at room temperature. Finally, in order to substitute the
acetate anion, a benzoate ion was used and thiazolium 84 was isolated with 47% yield.

3.3     Reactivity of new thiazolium salts in the retro-benzoin condensation
        The reactivity of a range of new thiazolium catalysts has been examined in the retro-benzoin
condensation of D-ketol 12 under microwave irradiation (150°C, CH3CN (0.1M), 30 min). The chain
length of N-alkyl was the first evaluated using a series of thiazolium salts (Table 10). Increasing the
length chain from C1 to C8 led to a rapid decrease of the conversion of reaction from 45% (for
methyl) to 17% (for n-octyl) (Table 10, entries 1-4). The same trend was observed with the yield of
two aldehydes (23% with N-methyl to 17% with N-octyl) and acyloin products 28 and 55. With
thiazolium 75, a similar result was obtained and compared with pre-catalyst 72, there was not too

much difference in reactivity between the iodine and bromine anion (Table 10, entry 5). For
thiazolium salt 76 bearing a N-isopropyl chain and a bromine anion, almost no conversion was
observed, argueing that a bulky group could dramatically diminish the activity of catalyst (Table 10,

           A range of thiazolium salts with a variety of couteranions was also investigated (Table 11).
With a series of anions such as I-, Br-, OTf-, BF4- and CF3COO-, the conversions reached around 34-39%
and the yield of aldehydes 27-65 and self-benzoin products 28-55 were achieved around 23-29% and
8-10%, respectively (Table 11, entries 1-5). Therefore, the nature of anion has a small influence on
the catalytic activity. The best candidate was recorded with triflate couter-anion. It has been noted
that triflate is a charge-delocalized anion, then it prevents the nucleophilic substitution of the N-Me
of the thiazolium species, leading to the increase the stability of precatalyst. A better conversion
(52%) was observed with NTf2- anion. However, only around 20% of aldehydes and 3% of acyloin
products were achieved, confirming that the reaction generated more by-products (Table 11, entry
6). Thiazolium benzoate 84 was next tested for retro-benzoin but only a low yield of aldehydes was
obtained (Table 11, entry 7). Finally, an experiment using thiazolium catalyst 84 without external
base was carried out and a similar result was obtained, indicating that benzoate anion could play the
role of an internal base for the formation of thiazolylidene species (Table 11, entry 8).

3.4 Study of the thermal stability of thiazolium salts by TGA 267
            To deeper understand the decomposition of thiazolium salts, the thermal stability of
precatalysts was evaluated via dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Even if this method
overestimates the thermal stability, it usually provides useful information on the short-term thermal
stability of ionic liquids and is generally used for comparative purposes.268 The decomposition
temperatures are reported in terms of Tstart (the temperature at which the decomposition of the
sample starts), Tpeak (the peak temperature of the time derivative of the mass loss curve, d(mass)/dt),
Tonset (the intersection of the zero mass loss baseline and the tangent line through Tpeak) and Tendset
(the intersection of the maximum mass loss baseline and the tangent line through Tpeak). Moreover,
contrary to imidazolium-based ionic-liquids, few TGAs were reported on thiazolium derivatives.269
First, the influence of the alkyl chain length on the stability was investigated with a series of
thiazolium iodides 71-74 and dynamic TGAs were measured under nitrogen at a heating rate of
20°C.min-1 (Figure 10). In fact, there is no significant different between methyl and octyl chain and
almost all TGA curves were superimposed, indicating that there was no influence of the length chain.

However, there was a slightly decrease of Tonset when the lengh chain was increased, confirming the
drop of reactivity. This result is in accordance with the behavior of imidazolium salts.270

         A second range of N-methyl thiazolium salts were next studied by TGA (Figure 11). Halide
anions such as I and Br display very similar behavior with comparable Tonset, Tpeak and Tendset (Table 12).
It has been clearly seen that fluorine subtituted anion gave a significant difference. While CF3CO2
anion reduces the thermal stability compared to halides, the use of BF4, OTf and NTf2 anions
increases the decomposition temperature of at least 100°C.

two different mode of degradation, one from the thiazolium cation and other one from the NTf 2
anion. These results show that the overall thermal stability of thiazolium salts is mainly governed by
the nature of the anion and the relative robustness of these species could be ranked as follows: OTf >
BF4 > NTf2 > I > Br > CF3CO2. Finally, thiazolium triflate 79 was found to be the more stable precatalyst
with a degradation temperature of about 395°C.

        In conlusion, a wide range of thiazolium salts has been evaluated for the retro-benzoin
condensation of D-hydroxyketone 12 under microwave irradiation (150°C, CH3CN, 30 minutes).
Among them, the thiazolium catalyst bearing with N-methyl chain and triflate anion exhibits a high
stability and is potentially the best candidate for this non-oxidative cleavage method. The methyl
chain is responsible for the high reactivity and the charge-delocalized anion triflate is accountable to
high thermal stablility of the precatalyst. Then, this thiazolium salt 79 was further used in reactive
distillation under optimized conditions.

3.5 Re-investigation of the reactive distillation with robust thiazolium salt
        The reactive distillation was re-investigated using the most promising catalyst 79 in term of
thermal stability and reactivity. In the presence of thiazolium salt 79 (20 mol%) using K2CO3 (10
mol%) as an external base, D-hydroketone 12 was introduced at room temperature and heated at
180°C (to give a homogeneous solution). The cleavage of D-hydroxyketone 12 was performed at

180°C under reduced pressure (p =1-3 mbar) and gave an overall 75% weight yield for aldehyde
products 27 and 65 after only 15 minutes (Table 13, entry 1). However, we have noticed that some of
thiazolium salt 79 has been sublimated under these conditions. In order to avoid this inconvenience,
thiazolium salt 85 bearing with n-butyl chain and triflate anion was synthesized in two-steps
(alkylation and metathesis of counter anion) (Scheme 94).

          Then, the cleavage reaction was carried out with pre-catalyst 85. Satisfyingly, the reaction
provided 75% weight yield of cleavage products and the yields of aldehydes 27 and 65 were
calculated to 85 and 71%, respectively (Table 13, entry 2). Decreasing the temperature to 160°C gave
the same proportion for the two aldehydes but the overall yield declined to 70% (Table 13, entry 3).
Finally, the crude D-hydroxy ketone obtained from mono-oxidation of fatty vicinal diol (containing
83% of D-hydroxyketone 12, the corresponding diketone (5%), the corresponding diol (3%) and
nonanoic acid (6%)) was used as the starting material. The retro-benzoin condensation gave the two
aldehydes 27 and 65 with 85 and 71% yield based on the purity of D-hydroxyketone 12, emphasizing
the robustness of the catalytic system (Table 13, entry 4).

          To more understand the long-term thermal stability of the precatalyst during retro-benzoin
condensation process, thiazolium salt 85 was evaluated by isothermal thermo-gravimetry analysis
under nitrogen atmosphere (Figure 12).

          When isothermal temperature increases from 180 to 230°C both for 10 hours, the mass loss
of 85 increases from 1.5 to 5%, probably due to the release of absorbed water inside the catalyst..
However, the degradation of thiazolium salt 85 increased to 83% when the isothermal TGA was
performed at 280°C for 10 hours. Moreover, almost all of thiazolium salt decomposes after 2 hours
when the sample is heated at 330°C. Finally, thiazolium salt 85 is stable below 230°C which is higher
than the reaction temperature for retro-benzoin condensation process



4. Scope for retro-benzoin condensation of fatty D-ketols
          The scope for the retro-benzoin condensation of D-hydroxyketones derived from vegetable
oils was next investigated under optimized condition (20 mol% of thiazolium salt 85, 10 mol% of
K2CO3, 180°C, 15 minutes under vacuum) (Table 14). These starting materials were synthesized from
the corresponding diols, using both of two methods developed: the mono-oxidation by Pd(OAc)2-
neocuproine complex and the dehydrogenation by activated Ru/C (see Chapter II). First of all,
symmetrical fatty D-ketols such as 28 and 55, derived from the self-metathesis products of methyl
oleate, were used. The cleavage of 28 gave 88% isolated yield of nonanal 27 while 80% yield of
aldehyde ester 65 was afforded after retro-benzoin condensation of 55 (Table 14, entries 1-2).

          This procedure was also used for other oleochemical subtrates. Unsymmetrical fatty ketols
52 and 54, originated from butyl oleate and 2-ethylhexyl oleate gave nonanal 27 with 82% and 93%
yield, respectively (Table 14, entries 3-4). In these case, the bifunctionalized aldehydes could not

(Scheme 95).




            Scheme 95: The formation of by-products 89-91 from the retro-benzoin condensation

        As a result, symmetrical D-ketols 89 and 90 were isolated after column chromatography with
39 and 54% yield, respectively. A similar behavior was obtained with the fatty D-hydroxyketone 56.
Interestingly, an excellent yield (98%) of nonanal 27 was afforded and 30% yield of self-benzoin
product 91 was obtained after purification (Table 14, entry 5).

        Then, the retro-benzoin of fatty α-ketol 57, derived from methyl ricinoleate, was next
investigated (Table 14, entry 6). However, only poor yield of (R)-3-methoxynonanal 87 and aldehyde-
ester 65 were given. We hypothesized that the methoxy group was bulky enough to circumvent the
addition of N-butyl thiazolium catalyst onto the carbonyl group. For this reason, thiazolium salt 79
was used and better yields of two aldehydes were obtained (15 and 30% yield). However, these
results were not as good as those previously obtained. In fact, it should be noted that, in the
presence of the methoxy group, the starting materials exist as a mixture of 4 inseparable isomers
(NMR ratio = 25:18:21:36). Consequently, it is possible that one of these isomers reacts faster than
the others with catalyst 79 to give retro-benzoin products. It also explained why some of the starting
material was recovered from the residue. Then, tris-(D-hydroxyketone) 60, synthesized from high-
oleic sunflower oil (85% oleic content) and containing approximately 60% of D-ketol functionality,
was also investigated under optimized conditions (Table 14, entry 7). Significantly, the retro-benzoin
was performed with 25% yield of nonanal 27, emphasizing that challenging substrates such as crude
triglycerides could be cleaved under the conditions developed. This could open a new direction to
valorize the cooking oil to value-added aldehydes which could be used in the preparation of bio-
based surfactants, bio-polymers, etc. Finally, to further demonstrate the versatility of this method,
benzoin 86 was examined for this transformation (Table 14, entry 8). Interestingly, an excellent yield
(90%) of 88 was afforded using a vacuum pressure of 50 mbar.

        In conclusion, we have developed the retro-benzoin condensation of fatty D-hydroxyketones.
The reaction was conducted in the presence of a robust thiazolium salt 85 (20 mol%) and K2CO3 (10
mol%) at 180°C for only 15 minutes and gave a range of bio-aldehydes in good yields (up to 98%).
Moreover, these conditions could be also applied for triglyceride derivatives as well as aromatic

5. Stetter reaction with Michael acceptor
            The non-oxidative cleavage of methyl oleate-derived α-hydroxyketone, employing an
organocatalyst thiazolium salt provided a mixture of two aldehydes: nonanal and methyl
azelaaldehydate in good yields. Nonanal can be used as a fragrance in perfume industry or serve as
the alkylating agent for the preparation of 100% biobased-surfactants through aldolisation271 or
reductive etherification of polyols272 and carbohydrate derivatives.273 Comparatively, there are not so
many studies on the valorization of methyl azelaaldehydate (Scheme 96). The aldehyde ester can be
hydrogenated under hydrogen pressure in the presence of a palladium catalyst to give methyl 9-
hydroxynonanoate, that could be further (co)polymerized to provide (co)-polyesters (Scheme 96, a)
184
          while the reductive amination of the aldehyde ester with ammonia can give access to the
corresponding amino ester that serve as a monomer for the production of polyamides (Scheme 96,
b).274 The development of a complementary route to approach new bio-based monomers from this
interesting chemical platform is highly desirable. In this context, we have studied the formation of
various monomers through Stetter reaction (Scheme 96, c).

      5.1 Stetter reaction with non-aromatic aldehydes
        The Stetter reaction,275 i.e. the 1,4-addition of an aldehyde onto a Michael acceptor, employs
Umpolung reactivity and has been extensively studied in both intra- and intermolecular versions (See
organocatalyst, chapter 1). However, it has been by far less studied in the context of the valorization
of biomass. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few studies reported on the valorization
of biomass via Stetter reaction. In an earlier work, Novak et al. reported the synthesis of a
prostaglandin synthon via Stetter reaction between methyl azelaaldehydate and methyl acrylate.276
This reaction was catalyzed by a thiazolium salt and provided 42% of the Stetter adduct (Scheme 97).
However, the corresponding symmetrical α-hydroxyketone was also obtained in 58% yield, indicating
that the benzoin condensation is the main competing reaction.




            Scheme 97: Stetter reaction between bio-fatty aldehyde and MA in the presence of thiazolium salt

        More recently, Xie et al. have developed a polyether-substituted thiazolium ionic liquid for
Stetter reaction.277 This reaction was conducted in the presence of thiazolium catalyst (15 mol%) at
80°C, employing butanal as a model substrate. However, only 37% selectivity of Stetter adduct was
obtained, due to the formation of several by-products such as benzoin condensation product, Diels-
alder adducts of Michael acceptor (Scheme 98).

equivalents – generated from hexoses through retro-benzoin condensation with enones to give the
corresponding β-formylketones in good yields, up to 83% (Scheme 87, see more details in literatures

        From these literature precedents,276-277 a competing selectivity between the Stetter adduct and
benzoin condensation product is the critical point of this reaction. In fact, both the Stetter and
benzoin condensation reactions are correlated with the reactivity of the Breslow intermediate
(Scheme 100). On the one hand, the nucleophilic addition of the Breslow intermediate onto the
aldehyde, followed by hydride transfer, could release the symmetrical α-hydroxyketone as the
benzoin condensation product (Scheme 100, cycle A). On the other hand, the addition of the Breslow
intermediate onto the Michael acceptor provides the Stetter adduct (Scheme 100, cycle B). In most
cases, the aldehyde is more reactive than the Michael acceptor, leading to the α-hydroxyketone as
the main product. However, considering that the benzoin condensation is a reversible process while
the Stetter reaction is not, the Stetter adducts can be produced as final products, as these species
are usually thermodynamically favored.278 With aromatic aldehydes (R1 = Ar), the reverse process can
occur at low temperature (typically 25°C). Consequently, aromatic α-hydroxyketones, i.e. benzoin,
furoin can be used as aldehyde precursors for the Stetter reaction.279 In contrast, the α-
hydroxyketones produced from aliphatic aldehydes (R1 = alkyl), i.e. acyloins, are by far more stable
than their aromatic analogues. Therefore, the retro-benzoin process can only occur at elevated
temperature (typically 130°C) and can only be catalyzed by thiazolylidene species generated from the
corresponding thiazolium salts, as reported by Miyashita,257 Chi213 and our groupErreur ! Signet non défini.

  CHAPTER III: CLEAVAGE OF α-HYDROXYKETONES TO ALDEHYDES

      Herein, we would focus on the 1,4-addition of methyl azelaaldehydate onto a range of Michael
acceptors to give bi-functionalized products that could serve as new bio-based monomers.

    5.2 Results and discussion
      Methyl azelaaldehydate was prepared through retro-benzoin condensation of α-
hydroxyketone 12 and methyl acrylate was chosen as the model Michael acceptor for the first
optimization.
      The reaction was first screened in the presence of a range of azolium salt. The reaction was
conducted in dried acetonitrile under microwave irradiation at 130°C (Table 15). After 30 minutes,
the reaction with commercially available thiamine-derived thiazolium salt 94 gave a moderate
conversion (59%) and Stetter adduct was obtained with only 27% yield (Table 15, entry 1). Under
these conditions, the symmetrical α-hydroxyketone 55 was also formed with 18% yield. With our
home-made thermally robust thiazolium triflate 85, the conversion was improved to 89% and Stetter
product was also obtained with 48% yield (Table 15, entry 2). A slightly better result was observed
with commercially thiazolium salt 71, providing Stetter adduct in 50% yield (Table 15, entry 2).
Finally, triazolium salt 95, used as negative control, gave no Stetter product and only yielded the self-
aldolisation of aldehyde, confirming again the superiority of thiazolylidene species to catalyze the
desired transformation (Table 15, entry 4). From these results, thiazolium salt 71 was selected as a
precatalyst for further optimization.

     The effect of temperature was next studied on the Stetter reaction between aldehyde 65 and
methyl acrylate 92 under microwave activation (Figure 13). From 110 to 130°C, an increase in
conversion of aldehyde 65 and yields in Stetter product 93 and α-hydroxyketone 55 was observed.
However, both the conversion and the yields declined above 130°C. This phenomenon could be
attributed to the degradation of the thiazolium precatalyst 71 under these relatively harsh
conditions. Consequently, further optimization was carried out using 130°C as the optimal
temperature.

     The effect of the quantity of Michael acceptor 92 has then been next studied (Table 16). As
expected, the yield in Stetter product 93 progressively increased between 2.5 and 10 equivalents of
methyl acrylate (Table 16, entries 1-3). Further increase to 15 equivalents did not lead to significant
improvement, as the selectivity only increased slightly (Table 16, entry 4). Consequently, 10
equivalents of methyl acrylate were selected as a good compromise. Finally, increasing the reaction
time under our best conditions did not improve significantly the results.

            Overall, under the best conditions, the desired Stetter product 93 was afforded with only
50% yield, while the undesired acyloin 55 was obtained in 33% yield. This moderate selectivity could
be explained by the low electrophilicity of methyl acrylate. This assumption is supported by Domingo
et al. in a DFT study aiming at classifying several Michael acceptors according to their reactivity
toward nucleophilic addition.280 Keeping in mind that the objective is to synthesize aliphatic Stetter
products with suitable functional groups for polymerization, a range of Michael acceptors was tested
under optimized conditions (Table 17). Firstly, fumaric acid was evaluated for this transformation but
no conversion was obtained with this Michael acceptor (Table 17, entry 1). This can be explained by
its insolubility in acetonitrile and the fact that an equivalent of dicarboxylic acid could be reacted
with the base as well as protonated the free carbene, then preventing the generation of active
carbene species. Surprisingly, no reation occurred with maleic anhydride that is known as one of the
most electrophilic Michael acceptors (Table 17, entry 2).281 In fact, the carbonyl moiety in maleic
anhydride is more electrophilic than the one of the aldehyde. So, we hypothesised that the carbene
formed from thiazolium 71 could directly add onto maleic anhydride instead of the aldehyde, thus
giving a stable species and trapping the catalyst (Scheme 101).

            A similar intermediate, generated through an insertion of dialkoxycarbene onto maleic

representative considering that the conversion was very low (7%) (Table 17, entry 3). Acrylonitrile
and methyl acrylate were the next probed under the optimized condition. After 30 min, both of them
gave a good conversion (88-92%) but a moderate selectivity for the Stetter adduct was also obtained
(72-79%), due to the similar electrophilicity of the carbon in mono-subtituted ethylenes (Table 17,
entries 4-5). Dimethyl maleate and dimethyl fumarate were also investigated but a difference in
selectivity was observed with these two geometric isomers. On the one hand, dimethyl maleate
provided a good conversion (88%) and a balanced formation of the benzoin and stetter product

(50:50) (Table 17, entry 6). On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate gave a better selectivity for triester
product (85:15) (Table 17, entry 7). However, the conversion was remained at only 65%. Finally,
chalcone 102, a strong electrophilic Michael acceptor, was also evaluated under these conditions.
Interestingly, the reaction provided a good selectity for the Stetter product (93%) and the desired

      CHAPTER III: CLEAVAGE OF α-HYDROXYKETONES TO ALDEHYDES

           The product at 5.76 min has been characterized as the diester 93, that is the exactly the same
that the Stetter adduct formed by reaction between aldehyde 65 and methyl acrylate 92. We thus
hypothesized that Stetter adduct 105, which is a β-ketoester, could undergo decarboalkoxylation in
the presence of traces of water, thus giving product 93. A similar reaction has been previously
reported by Curran et al., showing that microwaves play an important role in this process.283 In order
to confirm this hypothesis, water (2.4 equiv) was voluntarily introduced in the crude after reaction
and the mixture was heated at 180°C under microwave irradiation for an extra 30 min. Under these
conditions, the initial 91:9 ratio between products 105 and 93 switched to 42:58 in favor of 93, thus
confirming our hypothesis (Scheme 102). Finally, considering that it is difficult to produce 93 with
high selectivity from the direct Stetter reaction with methyl acylate, the decarboalkoxylation of 105
offers an interesting alternative to access this diester.

           The second by-product at 6.7 min on the GC chromatogram of the crude mixture has been
identified as methylene thiazolylidene species 108. To account for the formation of this species, we
proposed that dimethyl fumarate could undergo 1,4-addition of the thiazolylidene to furnish
intermediate 107, then followed by proton transfer (Scheme 103).
           Another possibility is the [2+1] cycloaddition of dimethyl fumarate and the free carbene to
give the spirocyclopropane derivative 109 as the primary product (Scheme 103). However,
spirocyclopropane species is highly unstable due to ring strain and “push-pull” interaction of
substitution pattern of spiro cyclopropane system. Consequently, this species could be converted to
methylene thiazoline intermediate 108 through rearrangement. This structure has been assigned by
1     13
 H,    C-NMR analysis. Satisfyingly, the apparition of the characteristic proton at 3.45 ppm clearly
indicated the formation of allylic proton inside methylene thiazolylidene 108. Otherwise, a similar
phenomenon was reported by Enders et al since triazolinylidene reacts with dimethyl fumarate or
maleate, confirming our hypothesis.284-285 Moreover, this species was also elucidated by HR-ESI-MS
and the measurement of exact mass ([M+H]+ = 272.0941), was confirmed for molecular formula of
C12H18NO4S. Furthermore, we have also investigated the reaction under the same condition but in the
absence of aldehyde 65. After 1 hour, the species 108 was observed as a sole product. Otherwise, the

generation of methylene thiazolylidene intermediate 108 is not likely reversible. To confirm this
hypothesis, the species 108 was used as a precatalyst instead of thiazolium salt 71, with or without
K2CO3, under the optimized conditions. No Stetter adduct or benzoin product was obtained under
these condition, indicating that the species 108 is stable in our reaction condition and only dipole
intermediate 107 could reverse to release the free carbene.

    5.3 Conclusion
    In summary, we have developed a new valorization route of vegetable oil-derived methyl
azealdehydate through NHC-catalysed Stetter reaction. A wide range of Michael acceptors were
evaluated under optimized condition and it was found that dimethyl fumarate gave the best result
with 95% conversion and 97% selectivity for Stetter adduct. We have shown here that the selectivity
between Stetter adducts and benzoin condensation product can be switched by using a strong
electrophile. Furthermore, we have identified a new species 108 within the frame of this study.
Finally, the di- or tri-esters obtained from this study could be used as chemical platforms in the
preparation of bio-based polymers.

1. Introduction
        In the previous parts, we have developed simple conditions to oxidize bio-sourced 1,2-diols
to the corresponding D-hydroxyketones, using a catalytic system of Pd(OAc)2 and neocuproine. This
reaction was performed well in a range of fatty diols and gave good yields of desired D-ketols.
However, in almost all of the cases, fatty 1,2-diketones are obtained as the only by-products. To
valorize this by-product, we envisioned that the catalytic cleavage of fatty diketones using a
thiazolium salt in the presence of oxygen could give the corresponding esters (Scheme 104). These
esters are also really interesting for surfactants and polymer applications.

2. State of Art

      2.1 Preparation of fatty diketones
       Fatty D-diketones have a range of applications for the synthesis of value-added compounds.
They could be used for the preparation of heterocyclic substrates286,287 as well as for the cleavage to
smaller building blocks in fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.288 Conventionally, there are three
major pathways to access these intermediates. The first approach to vicinal fatty diketone was
through direct oxidation of unsaturated fatty acid derivatives. According to Jensin and Sharpless, the
oxidation of methyl oleate using KMnO4 as an oxidant occurs at 5°C and provided 40-50% yield of the
desired products (Scheme 105, route A).289 However, this method suffers from diluted conditions (2 g
of substrate per liter of solvent) and has a lack of selectivity. The second route for the preparation of
fatty diketones that was reported by Doll et al., involves the oxidation of epoxidized methyl oleate.62
This reaction requires a certain amount of Bi(III) triflate at 90°C, using DMSO as an oxidant (Scheme
105, route B). A quantitative conversion of epoxidized methyl oleate was observed after 2 hours.
However, an inseparable mixture of monoketone and diketone (65:35) was obtained. Moreover, this

method generates dimethyl sulfide that is a malodorous and toxic gas, then compromising the scale-
up. The third pathway for the preparation of fatty D-diketones is the oxidation of fatty diols (Scheme
105, route C). The reaction was conducted in the presence of pyridine in CCl4, using NBS as an
oxidant, thus providing a good yield of the desired product (75%).290 However, this method requires a
big excess of dangerous oxidant such as NBS and is performed in a highly toxic solvent.

       More recently, Das et al. demonstrated a CO2-assisted the synthesis of diketones, derived from
aromatic aldehydes (Scheme 106).291 The reaction was conducted in the presence of catalytic amount
of a thiazolium salt, using DMSO as an oxidant. This process provided good yields of D-diketone
compounds (64-86% yield). However, this reaction releases the toxic gas (dimethyl sulfide) as a co-
product and no example for aliphatic aldehyde was reported. Moreover, this method could not be
applied to the functionalization of fatty acid derivatives.

       In 1999, a preparation of unactivated diketones was reported by Kirihara et al. in the presence
of Vanadium (V) catalyst (1 mol%) (Scheme 107).292 This process involves two-step synthesis. The first
step is benzoin condensation of aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of thiazolium salts to provide D-
hydroxyketones in good yields. The second step is the oxidation of D-ketols at room temperature,
using atmospheric oxygen and gave good yields up to 99% of corresponding 1,2-diketones.

      2.2      Cleavage of D-diketones
       The cleavage of vicinal fatty diketones to the corresponding acids or esters has a great interest
due to the applications of the smaller chemical platforms. They could be used directly as bio-
lubricants, bio-herbicizers, plasticizers as well as converted to bio-surfactants or bio-polymers.
However, this field is underexploited. There are a few studies mentioning on the cleavage of vicinal
diketones, using inorganic reagents. In 1958, Kwart and Baevsky claimed that the cyanide anion could
catalyze the cleavage of aromatic diketones into corresponding aldehyde and ester in the presence
of alcohols.293 However, only kinetic studies were given in this report. Recently, benzyl-cyanide
reaction was reinvestigated by Sessler et al. to develop a selective cyanide indicator.294 They also
showed that in the presence of stoichiometric amount of tetrabutyl ammonium cyanide, benzil
derivatives could be cleaved to the corresponding aldehyde and ester in yield of 71 and 97%,
respectively (Scheme 108).




            Scheme 108: Cyanide-catalyzed cleavage of benzil derivatives to the corresponding aldehyde and ester

       Several studies recently mentioned the cleavage of diketones, employing the oxidizing agents
such as sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO) or oxygen. On the one hand, the cleavage of diketone
using oxygen gives only moderate yield of corresponding acid (50% yield) and requires a long
reaction time (51 hours) (Scheme 109, condition A). On the other hand, when bleach is used, good
yields of corresponding acid were reported for both aromatic and aliphatic substrates (79-87% yield)
(Scheme 109, condition B). However, a large quantity of sodium chloride was formed after this
reaction, indicating the limitation of this method.288,295

          In 2004, an efficient method for oxidative esterification of cyclic diketones was presented by
Borhan et al. The reaction was conducted in methanol at room temperature, using an excess of
Oxone (4 equiv) (Scheme 110).296 In fact, this reaction involves a two-step synthesis. Firstly, the cyclic
diketones could be converted to cyclic anhydride in the presence of oxone. Secondly, alcoholysis of
the cyclic anhydride occurs in excess of alcohol at room temperature to give a good yield (up to 90%)
of dimethyl ester. However, a large quantity of waste was generated, indicating the restriction of this
method.

          More recently, the cleavage of the aromatic diketones, using organocatalysts has also been
reported. Reinvestigated by Connor et al., the cleavage of benzil occurs in the presence of triazolium
catalysts at room temperature.297 The reaction provided a yield of 64% for the corresponding methyl
ester, in parallel with the formation of aldehyde or acid intermediates (Scheme 111).

          This strategy has also applied for the cyclic diketone. However, the process was conducted in
two steps. The first step involves the oxidation of diketones into the corresponding acids, then the
second step converts the acids to the corresponding methyl esters in the presence of methyl iodide.
The reaction was carried out in mild conditions and provided good yields of aryl esters (66-82%)

3. Results and discussion
       Herein we would first describe the synthesis of vicinal diketones derived from vegetable oil
derivatives that are considered as by-products from aerobic mono-oxidation of fatty 1,2-diols
catalyzed by a complex of Pd(OAc)2 and neocuproine. Then, the cleavage of fatty diketones is studied
in the presence of cheap and abundant thiazolium salt.

3.1 Preparation of D-diketones
           Initially, D-hydroxyketones were synthesized through benzoin condensation of aldehydes or
      mono-oxidation of vicinal diols, catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2-neocuproine as described in chapter II.
      Then, inspired from the studies of Kirihara et al., these D-hydroxyketone were oxidized under
      oxygen in the presence of VOCl3 (1 mol%) (Scheme 113). The reaction was carried out in
      acetonitrile at room temperature (20°C). After 18 hours, the complete conversion was observed
      with good yields of desired products. On the one hand, the treatment of symmetrical D-
      hydroxyketones gave the corresponding diketones in 87-90% yield. On the other hand, bio-based
      diketone derived from unsaturated fatty acids (methyl oleate and methyl erucate) were isolated
      in 90% and 77% yield.

3.2 Organocatalytic cleavage of fatty diketones.
      Encouraged by the results of Connon on the cleavage of aromatic diketone, catalysed by a
 triazolium salt, the organocatalytic cleavage of the fatty diketone derived from methyl oleate was
 investigated. The reaction was conducted at 65°C in the presence of a thiazolium catalyst (20
 mol%), using oxygen as an oxidant (Scheme 114).




             Scheme 114: Oxidative cleavage of fatty 1,2-diketones into the corresponding esters

      Under these conditions, almost complete conversion of diketone 13 was observed after 3
 hours. Then, methyl pelargonate 110 and dimethyl azelate 111 were achieved in moderate yields
 of 35% and 33%, respectively after GC titration using n-hexadecane as an internal standard.
 However, two heavier products 118 and 119 were also observed in the GC chromatogram at 10.1
 and 10.9 min (Figure 15).

     In fact, the formation of these by-products could be explained from a mechanism point of
view (Scheme 115). The first step of this reaction is a deprotonation of thiazolium salt in the
presence of an inorganic base such K2CO3 to generate the thiazolylidene species (I). This free
carbene could attack the diketone 13 to form the intermediate (II) that could be cleaved in the
presence of methoxide to release an ester and Breslow intermediate (III). Then, there are two
possible pathways for the next transformation. On the one hand, the Breslow intermediate could
be oxidized in the presence of oxygen to form the acyl carbene species (IV), then followed by
nucleophilic addition of methoxide from methanol to liberate the second ester and free carbene.
On the other hand, the Breslow intermediate (IV) could react with D-diketone 13 via acyl anion
transfer to form the coupling products 118 and 119 that are presented in GC chromatogram at
10.1 and 10.9 minutes. Moreover, it should be noted that each compound is a mixture of two
regioisomers that overlap on the GC chromatogram.

            Moreover, this hypothesis is confirmed by a report of Massi et al.299 In the presence of
        thiamine-based catalyst, the D-diketone was considered as a acyl anion equivalent that prefers
        to form the coupling products. Finally, the desired esters 110 and 111 were obtained as major
        products from this cleavage reaction, with the formation of other by-products 118 and 119. In
        order to obtain higher yields of the two esters, the cleavage of 118 and 119 to smaller products
        should be studied. According to Connon, in the presence of excess base and methanol, the
        cleavage of 118 to yield ester 110 and D-hydroxyketone 12 via hemiacetal 120 is conceivable
        (Scheme 116).297 Moreover, the D-ketol 12 could be also oxidized in the presence of oxygen and
        base to give the corresponding fatty diketone 13.

                The investigation was first carried out in the presence of thiazolium catalyst 71 (20 mol%),
       K2CO3 (20 mol%) in methanol at 65°C for 3 hours (Table 19). The yield of two corresponding
       diesters 110 and 111 was determined by GC titration curves, using n-hexanedecane as an internal
       standard. The influence of oxidants was first studied in oxygen, air or argon atmosphere.

           CHAPTER IV: CLEAVAGE OF DIKETONE TO ESTERS

       Under oxygen (1 atm), the conversion of diketone 13 was almost complete and the esters
110 and 111 were obtained with 35% and 33% GC yield, respectively (Table 19, entry 1). Slightly
improved results were also obtained when the reaction was carried out in the presence of 100
mol% of the base (Table 19, entry 2). This improvement could be explained the absence of the
generation of heavier by-products 118 and 119 in GC chromatogram. Moreover, a decreasing
yield of the two methyl esters was observed when air is used to replace the oxygen (Table 19,
entry 3). Finally, only 15% conversion of diketone was observed and no desired products was
detected when the reaction was conducted under argon atmosphere (Table 19, entry 4),
demonstrating the important role of oxygen for this oxidative process. As a result, 100% mol of
K2CO3 and atmospheric oxygen were kept for further optimization.

       A range of commercially available azolium salts were next screened as the precatalysts for
the oxidative cleavage of 1,2-diketones under typical conditions (20 mol% of azolium salt, 100
mol% of K2CO3) (Table 20). Triazolium 95, imidazolium 121 and benzothiazolium 122-123 were
first investigated and they all gave a full conversion (Table 20, entries 1-4). However, none of
these catalysts could lead to the generation of the desired esters with significant yields. On the
contrary, only thiazolium salts 69-71 could efficiently catalyze the cleavage reaction. The best
result was achieved with thiamine-based catalyst 70, providing a quantitative conversion and
42% yield of two esters 110 and 111. Moreover, the thiazolium salt 70 has a free OH that could
be oxidized during oxidation process. In order to avoid this phenomenon, the thiazolium salt 124
with O-methyl protection was synthesized and evaluated under these conditions. However, no
better results were obtained with precatalyst 124. Finally, thiazolium salt 70 was selected for
further optimization.

         After optimization, the conversion was also complete for almost all cases and the maximum
yield for each ester reached a plateau at 42%. To confirm this result, the reaction was scaled-up
using 1 g of diketone 13 derived from methyl oleate (3 mmol). The isolated yield of 110 and 111
were observed in 43% and 37% respectively, confirming the previous result of GC yield (Scheme
117).

         Based on our observation, other species, reprenseting half of the cleavage, must be
generated during the reaction. Moreover, these species are not detected by GC or GC-MS.
Otherwise, it should be noted that a slightly excess of the base (K2CO3) is required to afford the
highest yield of the esters. So, we hypothesized that the corresponding potassium carboxylates
were formed as the major by-products. Indeed, from a mechanism point of view, the Breslow
intermediate was generated after releasing the first ester, then there are two pathway for the
oxidative step (Scheme 118). The first route (cycle A) involves the oxidation of Breslow
intermediate (I), to form an acyl thiazolium species (II) that could be converted to the second
ester via nucleophilic addition of alcoholate species. The second route (cycle B) is related with
single electron transfer (SET) that a Breslow intermediate was oxidized in the presence of oxygen
to the intermediate (III). Then, this species could be converted to the acyl thiazolium (II) and
hydroperoxide species. This compound could oxidize another Breslow intermediate to give an
unstable the spiro-epoxide (IV) and the corresponding carboxylic acid. Then, the opening of the
epoxide could generate intermediate (V) that finally produces the desired carboxylic acid and free
carbene.

                              Scheme 118: Proposal mechanism for the formation of carboxylate

             Under our conditions, the carboxylic acid could be trapped as a potassium carboxylate. This
      is in accordance with our experimental results, showing that an excess of base is necessary to
      afford good yields (Table 21). A mixture of carboxylic acid and corresponding ester was observed
      as the products of the cleavage of aromatic diketone.

             To evaluate this hypothesis, the cleavage reaction of 1,2-diketone 13 was carried out under
      optimized conditions (20 mol% thiazolium salt 70, 100 mol% K2CO3, oxygen atmospheric, 65°C)
      but the work-up was modified (Scheme 119). An acid treatment until pH<5 was employed,
      followed by esterification with an excess of methanol in the presence of Amberlyst-15. This
      procedure allows the formation of two desired esters as the only products as confirmed by GC
      chromatogram of the crude after the treatment. Finally, the products were purified by column
      chromatography to give each esters 110 and 111 with 70% isolated yield. Recently, this
      hypothesis was also confirmed by a study of Bortolini who has reported the oxidative pathway of
      Breslow intermediate.300

  salt 70. The reaction was carried out in the presence of 1 mol% precatalyst 70 in 1 hour, following

  still complete and methyl nonanoate 110 and dimethyl azeleate 111 were obtained with a GC
  yield of 70% and 61%, respectively (Scheme 120).

4. Conclusions
        Herein, we have demonstrated that fatty 1,2-diketone 13 could be cleaved in the presence
  of azolium salts under oxidative conditions into two corresponding esters. It has been shown that
  only thiazolium salts could efficiently catalyzed this transformation and a maximum yield of 42%
  could be obtained for both esters. We have proven that the oxidative cleavage of vicinal diketone
  leads to the formation of a mixture of ester and potassium carboxylate. The carboxylate present
  in this mixture could be easily converted into the desired esters by an acidic treatment to give a
  70% overall isolated yield. The efficacy of this reaction at a low catalyst loading (1 mol%) and a
  short reaction time (1 hour) make this oxidative cleavage an interesting tool to convert diketone
  13 to valuable products. Finally, one could imagine that the protocol could be easily applied to
  other fatty diketones derived from other fatty acids.

1. Introduction
         In the previous part, we have described an organocatalytic cleavage of fatty D-
hydroxyketones to bio-based aldehydes with good yields, up to 98% yield. Even if each step has a
high conversion and selectivity, some drawbacks still remain such as the high price of triflate couter-
anion sources in the optimized thiazolium salts or the preparation of D-hydroxyketones in large scale.
In order to circumvent these critical issues, an alternative pathway has been developed, via the
fragmentation of E-hydroxy hydroperoxide 125 (Scheme 121), that is easily prepared from cheap and
widely available feedstocks such as epoxidized vegetable oil derivatives.

2. Literature

      2.1   E-hydroxy hydroperoxides in natural products
         β-hydroxy hydroperoxides are interesting chemical platforms in organic synthesis because
they are considered as key precursors for the preparation of 1,2,4-trioxane derivatives, which display
a precious anti-malarial activity.301 For example, Artemisinin and its semi-synthesis derivatives, i.e
sesquiterpene lactones containing unusual endo-peroxide bridge, are considered as a standard
worldwide treatment for malarial disease (Figure 16).302 They were first discovered by Chinese
scientist Tu Youyou in 1972 and were isolated from Chinese plant Artemisia annua. This discovery
was also brought a half of Nobel Prize in Medicine 2015 for Professor Tu Youyou.303 Moreover, these
1,2,4-trioxane derivatives have exhibited some biological activities such as antitumor,304
antituberculosis,305 etc.

      2.2   The synthesis of E-hydroxy hydroperoxides
        The synthesis of E-hydroxy hydroperoxides is quite underexploited. Until now, there are two
main pathways to approach these intermediates. The first route involves the oxidation of allylic
alcohol (Scheme 122).306-307 Even if this method gave a good yield of the desired products, this
photooxygenative pathway suffers from the access of the substrates.




        Scheme 122: Photooxygenation of allylic alcohols to access E-hydroxy hydroperoxides

        The second pathway is related to the ring-opening of epoxides with hydrogen peroxide.
Initially, this reaction was carried out in the presence of strong acids such as HClO4308 or CF3COOH
(Scheme 123).309 However, this reaction gives low yields of the peroxide products and suffers from
the use of ethereal solution that is quite explosive and dangerous. Moreover, the scope is limited for
to aromatic derivatives.




            Scheme 123: Homogeneous acid catalyzed for ring-opening epoxides to peroxide species

        Recently, some improvement methods have been reported using a certain amount of
catalysts such as Na2MoO4/glycine,310 phosphotungstic acid,311 tin (IV) chloride (SnCl4).312 Although
these catalytic systems give good yields, up to 96% of E-hydroxy hydroperoxides, all of these
methods suffer from the requirement of a metal catalyst (Mo, W and Sn-based catalyst) and have
been performed under homogeneous condition, leading to a difficult separation and recycling of the

catalysts. Moreover, the scope for this transformation is quite limited. Only examples for aromatic
and short-chain terminal epoxides are given and unactivated fatty epoxides are not tested under
these conditions.

         To avoid the drawbacks of homogeneous reaction, some heterogeneous catalysts have been
used e.g SbCl3/SiO2,313 phosphomolybdates/NPs CoFe2O4314 or Molybdenum/Graphene oxide315 and
gave a yield up to 96% for aromatic epoxides (Scheme 124). Moreover, these catalysts could be
reused at least 5 times without losing activity. However, some of above approaches have certain
shortcomings such as the leaching of metal species, the use of expensive catalyst or the use of
explosive reagent (an ethereal solution of H2O2). In this context, more eco-friendly method for ring-
opening of epoxides is highly desirable.




      Scheme 124: Synthesis of β-hydroxyperoxide alcohols in the presence of Mo-heterogenized catalyst

         Although the preparation of aromatic β-hydroxy hydroperoxide is known, the synthesis of
fatty hydroperoxide species is quite underexplored. Up to now, based on our knowledge, there are
two articles mentioning the preparation of these fatty substrates (Scheme 124). The first synthesis of
oleochemical β-hydroxy hydroperoxides was reported by Hiroko et al. in a patent in 2002.316 The
oxidation reaction of methyl oleate was carried out at 35°C, employing tungstic acid (12 mol%) as a
catalyst and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant (Scheme 125, conditions a). After 5 hours, a full
conversion of oleic acid methyl ester was observed but only 28% of fatty peroxide was obtained. The
second report of fatty hydroperoxide was described by Ruffo et al. in 2015.317 The oxidation of oleic
acid was carried out in the presence of tungstic acid (1 mol%) and an excess of hydrogen peroxide (4
equiv) at 70°C. After 4 hours, a complete conversion of oleic acid was obtained. However, the
selectivity of the desired product was approximately 45%, due to the formation of the inevitable
fatty 1,2-diol as a by-product (Scheme 125, conditions b).

           Next to the synthesis of perketal or 1,2,4-trioxane, displaying a variety of biological activities,
the cleavage of        E-hydroxy hydroperoxides to aldehydes has also been reported. Industrially,
aldehydes could be synthesized by hydroformylation of olefins126 or by reductive ozonolysis of
alkenes.184 However, both methods suffer with the use of highly energy intensive process or the
requirement of high purity metal-catalyst and sophisticated ligands. In the earlier work, Venturello et
al. reported that the decomposition of aliphatic E-hydroxy hydroperoxide in the presence of
quarternary ammonium dioxoperotungstate (1 mol%) at 85°C gave a good conversion (62%) after 1
hour and the desired aldehydes were obtained in 62% selectivity with the formation of the
corresponding acid, diol and D-hydroxyketone in 11, 8 and 14% selectivity, respectively (Scheme
126).

           More recently, Salomon et al. investigated the cleavage of hydroperoxide species in the
presence of catalytic amount of exogenous acids or bases (Scheme 127).318 On the one hand,
trifluoroacetic acid gave a quantitative conversion but a trace of desired aldehyde (1%) was obtained.
On the other hand, the use of external base such as pyridine or triethylamine provided a moderate
yield of free aldehyde (38%) and the corresponding diol was obtained as the major by-products (16-
57%) from this transformation.

        However, the use of metal ions as a promoter such as Fe3+, Cu2+ or the combination of
vitamin C and these cations could aid the cleavage of the peroxo species at 37°C and gives the
aldehydes as hydrate form, up to 80% selectivity in a short reaction time (5-30 minutes) (Scheme
128). Besides, the corresponding diol was also obtained in 5-9% yield, due to the homolylic cleavage
of hydroperoxide substrate.

        Similarly, Hiroko et al. claimed that fatty aldehydes were obtained from the cleavage of fatty
β-hydroxy hydroperoxides in 65% yield (Scheme 129).316 However, a very low concentration of
peroxide species (9 mM) and a low yield (28%) in the preparation of E-hydroxy hydroperoxide limit
the application of this method.

hydroperoxides as well as to decompose them to corresponding aldehydes. However, most of them
suffer from the use of dangerous agent (ethereal solution of hydrogen peroxide) or requirement an
excess of solvent and long reaction time. Then, a eco-friendly method with good yields of both fatty
E-hydroxy hydroperoxide and aliphatic aldehydes are highly desirable.

3. Results and discussions
      In this context, we have studied the preparation of bio-aldehydes from unsaturated fatty acid
  derivatives through a two-step synthesis (Scheme 130). The first step is the preparation of fatty
  E-hydroperoxide in the presence of acid catalyst and hydrogen peroxide (in H2O). Unlike the
  traditional works using oleic acid or methyl oleate,316,317 epoxidized methyl oleate was selected as
  a model substrate, due to its cheap price and widely availability (1-1.5 eur/kg). The second step
  involves the decomposition of peroxide species in the presence of catalyst in various solvents
  and temperatures.




     Scheme 130: The preparation of β-hydroxyperoxide alcohols to approach bio-aldehydes

  3.1 The preparation of the fatty β-hydroxy hydroperoxides
     The ring-opening of fatty oxirane was first carried out in the presence of acid catalyst (5
  mol%) in t-BuOH at 50°C, using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Firstly, a range of catalysts was
  screened to find the best catalyst for this transformation. After 1 hour, β-hydroxy hydroperoxide
  125 and the fatty diol 11 were detected as the major products (Scheme 131). On the one hand,
  β-hydroxy hydroperoxide 125 was formed via nucleophilic addition of hydrogen peroxide onto
  fatty epoxide 3. On the other hand, the vicinal diol 11 was generated by ring-opening of
  epoxidized oleic acid methyl ester in the presence of acid and water (from the hydrogen peroxide
  solution). A small amount of the corresponding α-hydroxyketone 12 was also detected as a by-
  product from degradation of β-hydroxy hydroperoxide 125 (Scheme 131).




     Scheme 131: Potential products from the ring-opening of fatty epoxide in the presence of H2O2

       First, paratoluene-sulfonic acid (PTSA) was used as a catalyst for this model reaction. After 1
  hour, 70% conversion of the fatty epoxide was obtained but the corresponding diol 11 was
  observed as the major product in 85% selectivity, due to the high acidity of PTSA (Table 22, entry
  1). Then, Montmorillonite-KSF and K-10 were next investigated under standard conditions. Only
  6% conversion was observed with Montmorillonite K-10 (Table 22, entry 2). However, a good
  conversion (92%) and 85% selectivity of fatty diol 11 were observed when Montmorillonite KSF
  was used (Table 22, entry 3). In fact, a difference in the conversion could be explained by the

acidity of the solid Lewis acid. Since Montmorillonite K-10 (pKa =3-4) was employed, this catalyst
was not enough acidic to activate the oxirane ring. However, when Montmorillonite KSF, with a
pKa of approximately 2, was used, the reaction occurred smoothly but with a low selectivity for
the desired product 125. Then, a phosphomolybdic acid (H3PO4.12MoO3) was also probed under
standard conditions. After 1 hour, 95% conversion and 52% selectivity for the desired product
were obtained (Table 22, entry 4). An improved result was observed when phosphotungstic acid
(H3PO4.12WO3) was tested for this model reaction. After 1 hour, a quantitative conversion of
epoxidized methyl oleate was observed and a good selectivity (55%) of the peroxide product was
afforded, in parallel with the formation of 33% of diol 11 and 4% of α-ketol 12 (Table 22, entry 5).
Then, tungstic oxide (WO3) was next candidate for this kind of transformation. After 1 hour, an
almost complete conversion (94%) with a moderate selectivity (55%) for the peroxide product
125 was reported (Table 22, entry 6). In parallel, 40% of fatty diol 11 and 5% of α-ketol 12 were
generated as major un-wanted products. Phosphoric acid (85 wt% in H2O) was also evaluated
under these conditions but no conversion was obtained with this inorganic acid (Table 22, entry
7). Finally, phosphotungstic acid was chosen for further investigation.

          The concentration of the starting material 3 in t-BuOH was next investigated (Table 23).
When a 1M concentration of epoxide 3 was used, a quantitative conversion was obtained with the
formation of 55% peroxide species 125 (Table 23, entry 1). An improvement of the selectivity to 60%
was obtained when a concentration of 0.5M was used (Table 23, entry 2). A further dilution (0.25M)

   desired product 125 was obtained in the presence of 5 mol% acid catalyst (Table 24, entry 1). On
   the other hand, a slightly better selectivity of peroxide species 125 (70%) was obtained when 1
   mol% acid catalyst was used (Table 24, entry 2). A similar result was also obtained with 0.5 mol%

70% selectivity) in a shorter reaction time (Table 25, entry 2). The reaction at 30°C gave the same
result than the reaction at 50°C (Table 25, entry 3). However, reaction time should be extended (10
hours) to complete the reaction. Finally, the temperature was kepted at 50°C for next optimization.

          In order to diminish the formation of fatty diol 11 as the major by-product, several strategies
were attempted such as using a water scavenger (to trap water from the solution of hydrogen
peroxide) or using an alternative oxidant that contains less water (Table 26). First of all, some water
scavengers were employed under the standard conditions (1 mol% PTA, 50°C, t-BuOH, 1h). When
anhydrous sodium sulfate and 4Å molecular sieves were used, almost no conversion of the epoxide 3
was obtained, probably due to the degradation of the hydrogen peroxide solution (Table 26, entries
1-2). When anhydrous MgSO4 was employed as the drying agent, an improved result was obtained.
In the presence of 1 equivalent of MgSO4, 80% selectivity of 125 and 16% selectivity of fatty diol 11
were obtained (Table 26, entry 3). Increasing the amount of MgSO4 (3 equiv) provided similar results
in selectivity for peroxide 125 and diol 11 with 81% and 14% respectively (Table 26, entry 4). Then,
trimethyl orthoformate was also evaluated. Under these conditions, a full conversion was obtained
with a declined formation of the diol 11 (10%). However, an increasing generation of α-ketol 12
(13%) led to decrease the selectivity of the peroxide 125 from 81% to 72% (Table 26, entry 6).

          Actually, diol 11 is the major by-product from this transformation, due to the presence of
water from the hydrogen peroxide solution. Then, an alternative oxidant containing less water was
next probed for the ring-opening of fatty oxiranes. A similar result (99% conversion, 81% selectivity)
was observed when a solution of hydrogen peroxide (50 %w in H2O) was used (Table 26, entry 5).
Moreover, Urea hydrogen peroxide (UHP, H2O2. NH2CONH2) was also tested but only a trace of
conversion was obtained (Table 26, entry 7), probably due to the intermolecular hydrogen bond in
UHP, leading a decrease of nucleophile of hydrogen peroxide.

               A range of various solvents was next investigated under standard condition, using
phosphotungstic acid (1 mol%), MgSO4 (3 equiv), H2O2 (50 wt% in H2O, 1.1 equiv) at 50°C for 1 hour
(Table 27). Tertiary alcohols such as t-BuOH, t-amyl-OH and 3-methyl-3-pentanol gave good
conversions (Table 27, entries 1-3). The reaction in t-BuOH and t-amyl alcohol provided a full
conversion and a high selectivity of 125 with 81 and 82% respectively (Table 27, entries 1-2).
However, 3-methyl-3-pentanol gave only 70% conversion and 71% selectivity for the desire product
125 (Table 27, entry 3). On the contrary, acetonitrile provided a poor result (Table 27, entry 4),
maybe caused by the degradation of hydrogen peroxide in acetonitrile in acidic medium
(Radziszewski reaction).319 Moreover, EtOAc and MTBE were also evaluated under these conditions
(Table 27, entries 5-6). Although good conversions (94-99%) were obtained, a moderate selectivity of
the peroxo species 125 (66-70%) were observed, indicating that both solvents are not suitable to
efficiently promote the reaction. Finally, t-amyl-OH was reinvestigated but a concentration of the
fatty epoxide 3 was diluted twice (0.25M) and a solution of H2O2 in t-amyl alcohol (0.5M) was

    and selectivity of products were determined by GC and NMR analysis; c) epoxide (6 mmol) was used.


           Finally, in order to validate our optimization, the reaction was scaled-up under the optimized
conditions using 5 g of epoxide 3 (14 mmol). The synthesis of fatty β-hydroxy hydroperoxide was
conducted in the presence of phosphotungstic acid (1 mol%), MgSO4 (3 equiv), H2O2 (50wt% in H2O,
1.1 equiv) at 50°C under mechanical stirring (Scheme 132). After 1 hour, a quantitative conversion
was observed and β-hydroxy hydroperoxides 125a and 125b were isolated in 75% yield after column
chromatography as an inseparable mixture of two regioisomers.

           Caution: evaporation of solutions which may contain fatty E-hydroxy hydroperoxide at a
rotary evaporator represents a serious safety risk and can cause explosion and destruction of
equipment. The peroxides value was 550 mmol O2/kg (NFT 60-220).317

chemical shift at 11.2 ppm (s) and 4.3 ppm (dd) are characteristic for the appearance of O-OH and O-
H. Moreover, a multiplet (3.6 ppm) next to a singlet of OCH3 (3.57 ppm) confirms the presence of 2 C-
H. These signals are characteristic of the β-hydroxy hydroperoxide function and this was also
                   13
confirmed by         C-NMR. Two signals at 69 and 87 ppm in 13C-NMR are also elucidated for 2-CH in
peroxide 125.

            When β-hydroxy hydroperoxide 125 was analysed by GC (and GC-MS), no trace of this
product was detected (Figure 18). On the contrary, two aldehydes nonanal 27 and methyl
azeladehydate 65 were obtained as main products. Next to them, some α-ketol 12 and diol 11 were
also observed in GC chromatography. This phenomenon could be explained by the cleavage of β-
hydroxy hydroperoxide 125. In fact, the injector temperature in the GC apparatus was approximately
300°C that was enough high to cleave the peroxide species 125 into two corresponding aldehydes.320

            Consequently, we decided to take advantages of this phenomenon to develop a clean
cleavage method for the synthesis of bio-aldehydes under thermal decomposition or probably under
flash pyrolysis.321

       3.2 Cleavage of fatty β-hydroxy hydroperoxides into aldehydes
            Based on our previous observation and the work of Hiroko et al.,316 the cleavage of fatty β-
       hydroxy hydroperoxide 125 was conducted at 80°C in tert-amyl alcohol (0.25M).316 After 4 hours,
       the quantitative conversion of 125 was obtained. However, only 45% selectivity for the
       aldehydes 27 and 65 was observed. The corresponding acids 126 and 127, α-ketol 12 and diol 11
       were obtained as major by-products (Scheme 133). In fact, the cleavage of β-hydroxy
       hydroperoxide could release the aldehydes 27 and 65 as the main pathway with water as a co-
       product (Scheme 133, route A). Moreover, the H of hydroperoxide species (O-OH) is quite acidic,
       then it could also “abstract” the C-H to give the α-ketol 12 as the major by-product (Scheme 133,
       route B). Furthermore, the aldehyde could react with the hydroxyperoxide species 125 to form
       the hemi-peracetal intermediate 128 that could be thermally decomposed to release the
       corresponding fatty acid and D-hydroxyketone 12 (Scheme 133, route C). On the other side, it
       should be noted that the aldehydes are reductants and β-hydroxy hydroperoxides are oxidants.
       As a result, they could also react together to provide the corresponding fatty acids and fatty diol
       11 (Scheme 133, route D).

      Then, a range of solvents was investigated under catalyst-free conditions, using a
0.25M concentration of the peroxide 125 in solvent (Table 28). The reaction was heated at
80°C for 4 hours. Both t-butanol and t-amyl alcohol gave an excellent conversion (99%).
However, only moderate selectivity of the aldehydes (44-45%) was observed (Table 28,
entries 1-2). Besides the aldehydes, the reaction in tertiary alcohols promotes the formation
of α-ketol 12 (12-20%) and corresponding acids 126-127 (16-27%), indicating that both of
them are not good for selective cleavage of β-hydroxy hydroperoxide 125 to aldehydes.
Acetonitrile was next probed for this reaction (Table 28, entry 3). After 4 hours at 80°C, the
conversion of peroxide 125 was also complete but a good selectivity of 68% was obtained for
the aldehydes. Otherwise, α-ketol 12, diol 11 and the two corresponding acids 126-127 were
also determined as by-products in 10, 8 and 6% selectivity, respectively. Moreover,
cyclohexane and toluene were also evaluated for this cleavage reaction but messy crudes
were obtained. Finally, acetonitrile was selected for the further investigation.

         The temperature of the reaction was next probed. A range of temperature from 60°-100°C
was employed for the cleavage reaction that was conducted in acetonitrile or propionitrile for a
suitable reaction time. When the reaction was carried out in acetonitrile at 80°C, a complete
conversion was obtained after 4 hours (Table 29, entry 2). However, only 68% selectivity of the
aldehydes was observed. Decreasing the temperature down to 60°C gave a quantitative conversion
and a slight improvement in the selectivity of aldehydes (76%) was obtained (Table 29, entry 1).
However, a prolonged reaction time was required. A temperature of 100°C was also tested under
these conditions. However, a boiling point of acetonitrile is approximately 80°C, then a similar
solvent with higher boiling point such as propionitrile was used (Table 29, entry 3). A quantitative
conversion was obtained with a selectivity of 76% for the aldehydes after a shorter time reaction (2.5
hours), indicating that propionitrile is one of the best solvents for the cleavage β-hydroxy
hydroperoxide into the corresponding aldehydes.

         A further attempt to improve the selectivity of the cleavage reaction was carried out, using
an additive as such acid or base, or working under diluted conditions. When the reaction was
performed in propionitrile (0.12 M), a same conversion was obtained after 2.5 hours (Table 29, entry
4). However, the selectivity of aldehydes was slightly dropped to 71%. On the other side, acid or base
additives were also probed under these conditions. When Amberlite-15 or DBU were used, a

quantitative of conversion was afforded after 2.5 hours but the selectivity for the corresponding
aldehydes was declined from 76% to 61% (Table 29, entries 5-6). This phenomenon could be
explained by the formation of more by-products. When Amberlite-15 (10 wt%) was used, the acidic
media promoted the generation of α-ketol 12 with up to 20%. Otherwise, basic medium (DBU 10
mol%) led to the formation of diol 11 with up to 18%. In fact, it is known that amines can reduce
hydroperoxides to corresponding alcohols.318 For example, tert-butyl hydroperoxide could be
reduced to give the tert-butanol in 80% yield in the presence of tri-n-propylamine. Then, the reaction
in the basic medium accelerates with the generation of diol 11.

             In conclusion, we have developed a clean cleavage method to synthesize bio-aldehydes from
fatty E-hydroxy hydroperoxide 125. This method was conducted at moderate temperature (100°C) in
catalyst-free conditions in short reaction time (2.5 h) to give the desired aldehydes 27 and 65 with
76% selectivity. In order to avoid the formation of by-products, the reaction should be further
investigated in flow continuous.

      3.3 Cleavage of β-hydroxy hydroperoxides into nitriles
            Fatty nitriles were also interesting chemical platforms in organic synthesis, due to their
      applications. First of all, nitrile derivatives could be used as key intermediates for further
      modifications (Scheme 134). For example, aliphatic nitrile can be hydrogenated under hydrogen
      pressure in the presence of metal catalyst to give fatty amines.322 Moreover, they could be also
      hydrolyzed to the corresponding fatty acid or aliphatic amides.322 Otherwise, fatty nitriles could
      reduce in the presence of DIBAL-H to give the imine intermediates that could hydrolyze to give
      the aldehydes without over-reduction.323 Moreover, aldehydes could be used in a wide range of
      applications in the preparation of polymers or surfactants.13




                          Scheme 134: Key transformations of fatty nitrile derivatives

            However, based on our knowledges, there are a few pathways to access fatty nitriles
      (Scheme 135). The first industrial pathway involved a hydrocyanation process (Scheme 135,
      route A).324 For instance, adiponitrile, a key precursor in the synthesis of nylon-6,6, was prepared
      through hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene.325 The second route, known as Kolbe nitrile synthesis,
      relies on a metathesis reaction of an alkyl halide and a metal cyanide (Scheme 135, route B).326
      However, both alkyl halide and metal cyanide are toxic and carcinogenic agents and this reaction
      suffers from competing selectivity between nitrile and isonitrile products. The third pathway that
      was recently developed, involves with the use of fatty acid derivatives and ammonium-sources
      (NH3 or CH3CN) (Scheme 135, route C).327-328

        CHAPTER V: CLEAVAGE OF EPOXIDE TO ALDEHYDES

      Because propionitrile was selected as the best solvent for the cleavage of β-hydroxy
hydroperoxide 125 into the corresponding aldehydes, the cleavage of this intermediate into
nitriles was conducted in propionitrile at 100°C, using hydroxylamine hydrochloride (2.5 equiv).
After 16 hours, 40% GC ratio of the nitrile products 131 and 132 was determined in GC analysis.
Moreover, these desired products were confirmed again by GC-MS analysis of the crude reaction
mixture. In fact, this process involves to three consecutive reactions. Firstly, the aldehydes are
afforded through cleavage of β-hydroxy hydroperoxide 125. Secondly, these aldehydes are
condensated with hydroxylamine to give aldoxime intermediates 129-130. Finally, these
derivatives were dehydrated under elevated temperature (100°C) to give the aliphatic nitriles
131-132 which could be further converted to value-added compounds such as fatty amines or
aminoesters.




               Scheme 136: Cleavage of peroxide intermediate to corresponding nitriles

       Herein, we have reported a preliminary result on the cleavage of a fatty β-hydroxy
hydroperoxide onto the corresponding fatty nitriles with a moderate yield (40%). A further
development to optimize this cleavage method is ongoing within our laboratory.

                  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

        During this Ph. D. work, we have developed two methods to produce bio-aldehydes from
unsaturated fatty acid derivatives as well as described several valorizations of other fatty acid
derivatives.




        The first route involves the preparation of fatty D-hydroxyketones and their organocatalytic
cleavage to give aldehydes with good yields. In this route, two conditions were developed to convert
the vicinal biosourced diols to thecorresponding D-hydroxyketones. The first one is the mono-
oxidation of fatty diols, using a Pd(OAc)2-neocuproine complex and oxygen as an oxidant. This
reaction occurs in smooth conditions, with a lot of advantages such as low catalyst loading, moderate
temperature and gives a high conversion (95%) and excellent selectivity (97%) of the D-
hydroxyketone derived from methyl oleate. Moreover, this catalystic system could be applied for
other 10 fatty D-hydroxyketones and gave good yields (42-84%).

        In order to provide a greener approach to fatty D-hydroxyketones, Ru/C was selected as the
best heterogeneous metal-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of oleochemical 1,2-diols. This
process occurs at elevated temperature (175°C) under vacuum (100 mbar) to give the desired
products with a high conversions and selectivity. Furthermore, the scope of this reaction was
evaluated for 9 other fatty diols, including polyols derived from vegetable oil and gave good yields,
up to 79%. Moreover, this heterogeneous catalyst can be recycled at least 5 times with constant and
high selectivity (ca 90%).

        The cleavage of D-hydroxyketones was studied by organocatalysis through reactive
distillation. A series of thiazolium salts was synthesized and their thermal stability was evaluated by
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to find the best catalyst for retro-benzoin condensation. Then, the
retro-benzoin of fatty D-hydroxyketones was conducted at 180°C in the presence of a thermally
robust thiazolium salt under reduced pressure to give aldehydes with good yields (71-85%).
Moreover, these conditions could be applied to other fatty and aromatic D-hydroxyketones and gave
high yield of bio-aldehydes (up to 98%).

                                                                                             Page 141


                  GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

        In order to develop a more environmentally-friendly route to aldehydes, the preparation of
fatty E-hydroxy hydroperoxides was carried out, using a cheap and renewable substrate such as
epoxidized methyl oleate. The reaction was performed in the presence of phosphotungstic acid (1
mol%) at 50°C to give the desired products in 75% isolated yield. Then, the fragmentation of this
species was studied under thermal condition (100°C) to provide 76% selectivity for the aldehydes.
Moreover, preliminary results showed that E-hydroxy hydroperoxides could also be converted to
value-added products such as fatty nitriles and fatty acids.

        Next to the preparation of aldehydes, the valorization of by-products (fatty diketones) and
aldehydes were also described on this manuscript. On the one hand, fatty diketones, that are the by-
products from the mono-oxidation of 1,2-diols using a catalytic system of Pd(OAc) 2-neocuproine,
could be cleaved into corresponding esters through organocatalysis. This reaction was carried out
using thiazolium salt in the presence of oxygen (balloon), giving good yields (up to 70%) of the
corresponding esters. On the other hand, aldehyde ester can be converted to 1,4-dicarbonyl
derivatives (that could be used as monomers) through Stetter reaction. This reaction also occurs in
the presence of a thiazolium salt and a range of Michael acceptors was also tested for this
transformation, then Stetter adducts could be obtained with high yields (up to 82%).

        Finally, two alternative pathways to produce fatty aldehydes from vegetable oil derivatives
have been developed in this Ph. D. with several advantages such as high yields, simple conditions and
relatively cheap catalysts. Even if the proof of concept has been established for these two routes,
more work will be necessary to develop them on a larger scale:

    1) For the first route, a heterogenization of thiazolium catalyst onto insouluble materials should
        be studied to recycle the organocatalyst. Then, a development of a continuous reactive
        distillation process could be investigated.

    2) For the second pathway, a development of a continuous flow process for the preparation
        and cleavage of fatty E-hydroxy hydroperoxide could be investigated for the selectivity and
        safety reasons.

1. General information
  All reagents and solvents used for synthesis were commercial and used without further
  purification. Methyl oleate (96% purity), technical (90% purity) oleic acid, 1-butanol, 2-ethyl
  hexanol, hydrogen peroxide (35% in water), nonanal (97%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar.
  Pd(OAc)2, neocuproin, MeOH, tert-butanol and H3PO3 were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and
  methyl 12-O-acyl ricinoleate (80% GC) by TCI. All catalysts such as Ru/C (5%wt), Ru/Al2O3
  (5%wt), RuCl3.xH20 were purchased from Strem chemicals. 9,10-dihydroxy octadecanoic acid
  (75% GC purity), sunflower oil and rapeseed oil were supplied by Oleon. All new compounds
  were characterized by spectroscopic data. Reactions were monitored by TLC using aluminium
  silica gel (60F254). They were carried out on a plate of 0.20 mm silica gel. For revelations, UV
  (λ = 254 nm) light was provided (Universal UV lamp CAMAC). A phosphomolybdic acid
  solution was used to reveal the TLC plate if necessary. Purification by flash chromatography
  was performed using silica gel 60H (40-63μm). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were
  recorded on a Brüker DRX 300 or Brüker ALS 300 (1H-300 MHz, 13C-75 MHz). Chemical shifts
  are given in ppm with reference to residual DMSO or CHCl3 central peaks: 2.50 and 7.26 ppm
  for proton, 39.52 and 77.16 ppm for carbon, respectively. J values are given in Hertz (Hz).
  Abbreviations are defined as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet of doublets, t =
  triplet, q = quadruplet, m = multiplet, br = broad. Mass spectra were performed in positive-
  ion mode on a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MicroTOFQ-II, Bruker
  Daltonics, Bremen) with an Electrospray Ionization (ESI) ion source. The flow of spray gas was
  at 0.6 bar and the capillary voltage was 4.5 kV. The solutions were injected at 180 μL/h in a
  mixture of solvents (methanol/dichloromethane/water 45/40/15). The mass range of the
  analysis was 50-1000 m/z and the calibration was done with sodium formate. Infra-red (IR)
  spectra were recorded in a SMART iTR-Nicolet iS10 spectrometer using Attenuated Total
  Reflectance (ATR) and the wave numbers are expressed in cm-1. Melting points were
  measured using a BUCHI Melting point (SMPIO) and noted in 0C. A first estimate of the
  melting point of some of our solids was performed on a Köfler bench and SMP-10 Stuart
  machine.



2. GC method
  Gas chromatography (GC) analyses for the 1,2-diols starting materials, the corresponding α-
  hydroxyketones and 1,2-diketone were performed using a Shimadzu GC (GC-2025) apparatus
  equipped with a ZB-5-MS capillary column (10 m, 0.10 mm i.d., 0.10 μm film thickness). The
  carrier gas was N2, at a flow rate of 0.43 mL/min and the injection mode is split (ratio 1:100).
  The column temperature was initially at 100°C for 1 min, and then was gradually increased to
  260°C (25°C/min) and the temperature was kept at 260°C during 2.5 min. Finally, the
  temperature was increased to 315°C (45°C/min) and kept at 315°C during 2 min. The injector
  and FID temperature were respectively set at 300°C and 315°C.

   mg, 0.24 mmol, 2 mol% in Pd), neocuproine (50 mg, 0.24 mmol, 2 mol%) were successively
   introduced in MeOH (8 mL) under stirring. The mixture was stirring at room temperature in a
   few minutes until the medium became more homogeneous. Next, glacial acetic acid (43 mg,
   0.72 mmol, 6 mol%) was added to the solution before closing the apparatus. Oxygen (3 bar)

   reaction mixture was cooled down to 25°C by stream of water before adding EtOAc (20 mL).
   The suspension was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to give
   a green oil (3.97 g). The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel
   (CH2Cl2/EtOAc, 100:0 Æ 95:5) to give the D-hydroxyketone (3.20 g, 80%) as white solid. See
   Supporting Information for the full characterization of the compound.

   5%-Ru/C (0.26 g, 5 mol% in Ru) were introduced. Then, argon was filled inside the
   equipment. The outline of apparatus was connected with evaporator system to control the
   vacuum pressure at 100 mbar. The reaction was heated at 175°C (oil bath) for 3 hours. After
   cooling to room temperature, EtOAc (2 x 20 mL) was added in the mixture then the resulting
   slurry was filtered though milipore system (pore 0.1 μm). The filtrate was evaporated under
   reduced pressure to give the crude product (0.89 g). The residue was purified by column
   chromatography on silica gel (CH2Cl2/EtOAc, 100:0 Æ 95:5) to give D-hydroxyketone.

      regioisomers) (65.7 mg, 0.2 mmol, 1 equiv), the thiazolium salt (0.04 mmol, 20 mol%) and
      K2CO3 (5.5 mg, 0.04 mmol, 20 mol%) were added. The tube was flushed with argon and
      dry CH3CN (2 mL) was added. The mixture was stirred under microwave irradiation at the
      desired temperature for a period of time. The mixture was cooled down to room
      temperature and analyzed by GC using hexadecane as internal standard.

        installed (Figure 19). Then, the mixture was heated at 180°C (oil bath pre-heated at
        180°C) under reduced pressure (vacuum = 1-3 mbar except in the case of D-
        hydroxyketone 28 and 86). The distillate was collected, weighted and analysed by GC,
        using n-hexandecane as internal standard. The residue was also weighted and analyzed
        by GC and NMR. If needed, the aldehydes could be further purified by flash
        chromatography (Cyclohexane/EtOAc 100:0 Æ 95:5). In some cases, the residue can be
        solubilized in EtOAc, then filtered through a Celite-545 and evaporated under reduced
        pressure to obtain a crude mixture. This mixture could be further purified by flash
        chromatography (Cyclohexane/EtOAc 100:0 Æ 90:10) to give symmetrical D-
        hydroxyketones 89, 90 and 91.

and dried (MgSO4), filtrated. The filtrate solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to
give the crude mixture which was further purified by column chromatography to obtaine fatty
1,2-diketones.

b) General procedure for the cleavage of fatty 1,2-diketones to corresponding esters
   A fatty 1,2-diketone (3 mmol), NHC precursors (0.6 mmol, 20 mol%) and K2CO3 (414 mg, 3
mmol, 100 mol%) were introduced in a 25-mL round bottom flask under oxygen atmosphere
(balloon), then MeOH (6 mL) was added. The mixture was heated at 65°C for 3 hours. After
cooling to room temperature, MeOH was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was
dissolved in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) and the solution was filtrated through celite and the filtrate was
evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in MeOH (2 mL) and a solution of
sulfuric acid (1 wt%) was introduced until pH was around 5, then this mixture was esterified in
the presence of Amberlyst-15 (20% w/w) for 18 hours. Finally, the mixture was filtered (to
remove Amberlyst), evaporated under reduced pressure and further purified by flash
chromatography (Cyclohexane/EtOAc from 100:0 to 94:6) to give the corresponding esters in
good yields.

flask under argon atmosphere, a solution of hydrogen peroxide (50% H2O2 in H2O, 1.1 equiv) was
added dropwise in the mixture and the reaction was heated at 50°C for 1 hour. After the
conversion was complete, the crude was filtrated through Celite-545 to remove the excess of
MgSO4 and phosphotungstic acid. This filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to give
the crude mixture which was further purified by column chromatography (Cyclohexane/EtOAc
from 96:4 to 90:10) to provide the fatty E-hydroxy hydroperoxide as a colourless oil.

b) General procedure for the cleavage of E-hydroxy hydroperoxides to aldehydes
   A fatty E-hydroxy hydroperoxide (1-3 mmol) and solvent (0.25M) were introduced in a 25-mL
schlenk flask under atmospheric argon. Then, this mixture was heated at a suitable temperature
(60-100°C) in a period of time (2-16 hours). When the reaction was completed, the mixture was
cooled at room temperature and a mixture of products was analyzed by GC and 1H-NMR.
