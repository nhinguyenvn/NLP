Introduction en fran√ßais

Cette courte introduction en fran√ßais a pour but de pr√©senter succinctement les moti-
vations et les objectifs de cette th√®se. Elle n'a pas la m√™me importance que celle √©crite
en anglais se trouvant au Chapitre 1 qui est plus progressive, plus d√©taill√©e et plus ap-
profondie. En compl√©ment de ce qui suit, nous vous invitons donc √† aller regarder la
Section 1.1 qui, par ailleurs, a √©t√© √©crite dans le but de pouvoir √™tre lue sans pr√©requis
math√©matiques et pr√©sente de nombreuses illustrations ainsi que quelques simulations.

Motivations physiques et mod√©lisation math√©matique
Dans de nombreux processus naturels [BS95, KS91], on peut observer des surfaces dont
le mouvement semble √™tre r√©gi par des ph√©nom√®nes qui, √† l'√©chelle microscopique, parais-
sent al√©atoires. C'est le cas, par exemple, pour la croissance du manteau neigeux par
d√©position de ocons de neige, la formation de cristaux, la fonte d'un gla√ßon dans un
verre d'eau ou encore pour l'extension d'une tache de caf√© sur une feuille de papier.
    Di√©rents mod√®les math√©matiques ont √©t√© con√ßus pour essayer de mieux comprendre
les m√©canismes d'√©volution de ces interfaces, d'un point de vue qualitatif. L'id√©e g√©n√©rale
issue de la Physique Statistique est de repr√©senter un syst√®me par ses (tr√®s) nombreuses
composantes microscopiques qui √©voluent en suivant transitions √©l√©mentaires al√©atoires.
Ces mod√®les sont en g√©n√©ral des cha√Ænes de Markov souvent en relation avec d'autres
mod√®les de la Physique Statistique comme les mod√®les de particules en interaction, le
mod√®le de dim√®res ou encore les pavages al√©atoires (voir Figure 1.5).
    Par exemple, parmi les mod√®les de croissance d'interfaces les plus simples gure celui
propos√© par Eden [Ede58] en 1956 pour d√©crire l'extension d'une colonie de bact√©rie par
morphog√©n√®se. Dans ce mod√®le illustr√© par la Figure 1.1, des cellules sont dispos√©es sur
les cases d'un damier de taille inni et, initialement, une cellule se trouve infect√©e au
centre du damier. √Ä chaque √©tape, une nouvelle cellule est infect√©e au hasard parmi
celles qui sont encore saines et qui sont voisines d'une cellule d√©j√† infect√©e. On peut
alors suivre l'√©volution de la surface al√©atoire form√©e par l'ensemble des cellules infect√©es.
Comme en atteste la simulation de la Figure 1.2a, on remarque qu'apr√®s un grand nombre
d'√©tape, l'interface observ√©e de loin semble se rapprocher invariablement d'une forme
limite d√©termin√©e √† l'avance qui ressemble √† un cercle. Cela peut sembler √† premi√®re
vue surprenant de part la nature al√©atoire du mod√®le microscopique mais constitute en
r√©alit√© un exemple de la bien connue Loi des Grands Nombres.

Limites hydrodynamiques et uctuations
Un des d√©s principaux est de d√©montrer math√©matiquement que l'√©volution de l'interface
microscopique al√©atoire converge, apr√®s r√©√©chelonnement spatio-temporel, vers le mou-
vement d'une interface macroscopique d√©terministe et continue qui est r√©git par une
√âquation aux D√©riv√©s Partielles (EDP) non lin√©aire de type Hamilton-Jacobi :
                                        ‚àÇt u = v(‚àáu).                                  (0.0.1)
Les simulations des Figures 1.3 et 1.7 illustrent ce type de convergence qui, dans le
contexte, s'appelle limite hydrodynamique.
    Ensuite, on s'int√©resse aux uctuations, c'est √† dire √† l'√©cart entre l'interface al√©atoire
et sa limite hydrodynamique comme illustr√© √† la Figure 1.2b. Il s'agit d'un probl√®me
bien plus compliqu√© que le pr√©c√©dent qui a attir√© activement les math√©maticiens depuis
quelques dizaines d'ann√©es. Ce que sugg√®rent les simulations num√©riques, c'est que ces
uctuations se comportent, √† grande √©chelle, comme la solution de l'√©quation KPZ, une
√âquation aux D√©riv√©s Partielles Stochastiques (EDPS) qui porte le nom de ses inventeurs :
Kardar, Parisi et Zhang [KPZ86] :
                                                            ‚àö
                           ‚àÇt h = ŒΩ Œîh + Œª ‚àáh, H ‚àáh + D Œæ,                            (0.0.2)
o√π Œæ est un bruit blanc et H est une matrice sym√©trique (typiquement la Hessienne
de la fonction v apparaissant en (0.0.1)). On conjecture que cette √©quation jouerait
un r√¥le universel pour d√©crire les uctuations des mod√®les de croissance d'interfaces
ind√©pendamment de leurs particularit√©s microscopiques, un peu √† la mani√®re de la loi
Gaussienne pour la moyenne d'exp√©riences al√©atoires ind√©pendantes ou du mouvement
Brownien pour le mouvement des particules dans un uide. Lorsque le comportement
√† grande √©chelle d'un mod√®le ressemble √† celui de la solution de l'√©quation KPZ, on dit
qu'il appartient √† la classe d'universalit√© KPZ.
    Si de nombreux progr√®s ont √©t√© r√©alis√©s depuis les ann√©es 2000 pour les mod√®les
d'interfaces unidimensionnelles (voir les revues [Cor12,Qua11] √† ce sujet), peu de r√©sultats
ont pour l'instant √©t√© montr√©s en dimensions sup√©rieures (voir [Ton18] pour une revue
sur des r√©sultats r√©cents en dimension 2). En dimension 2, la conjecture de Wolf [Wol91]
pr√©voit deux classes d'universalit√©s : KPZ Isotrope et KPZ Anisotrope selon les sym√©tries
du syst√®me ou plus pr√©cis√©ment de la signature de la matrice H de l'√©quation (0.0.2). En
particulier, Wolf conjecture que les uctuations de l'interface des mod√®les dans la classe
KPZ Isotrope grandissent comme tŒ≤ avec Œ≤  0.24 alors   ‚àö que pour ceux de la classe KPZ
Anisotrope, il conjecture qu'elles grandissent comme log t.

Objectifs de la th√®se
Dans cette th√®se, on √©tudie principalement deux mod√®les de croissances d'interfaces bi-
dimensionnelles qui appartiennent √† la classe d'universalit√© KPZ Anisotrope et qui seront
d√©nis pr√©cis√©ment au Chapitre 2. Le premier a √©t√© propos√© par Gates et Westcott
dans [GW95] comme mod√®le de d√©veloppement de cristal couche par couche (une illus-
tration gure sur la premi√®re page de couverture). Plus tard, ce mod√®le a √©t√© √©tudi√©


                                                                                          vii

par Spohn et Pr√§hofer [PS97] qui ont notamment calcul√© la fonction de vitesse v appa-
raissant dans l'√©quation (0.0.1) associ√©e au mod√®le. Le deuxi√®me peut √™tre vu comme
une dynamique d'empilement de cubes ou comme une dynamique de particules en-
trelac√©es et a √©t√© introduit par Borodin et Ferrari dans [BF14] et √©tudi√© par la suite
dans [CF17, Ton17, LT18, CFT19].
    Les r√©sultats que nous avons obtenus (et qui seront pr√©sent√©s en d√©tails au Chapitre
3) sont les suivants.
   ¬à D'abord, nous avons d√©montr√© les limites hydrodynamiques des mod√®les de Gates-
     Westcott et de Borodin-Ferrari, respectivement dans les Chapitres 4 et 5. Notre r√©-
     sultat, qui est valable en tout temps et pour tout prole initial pour lequel l'√©quation
     limite (0.0.1) est bien d√©nie, fait partie d'un des premiers de ce genre pour des
     mod√®les de croissance d'interfaces en dimension 2 et dans le cas d'un Hamiltonian
     (la fonction v de (0.0.1)) ni convex ni concave, ce qui rend l'√©tude de l'√©quation bien
     plus compliqu√© essentiellement car la solution n'a pas de formulation variationnelle.
     Cela generalise le r√©sultat obtenu par Legras et Toninelli dans [LT18] o√π la lim-
     ite hydrodynamique pour le mod√®le de Borodin-Ferrari a √©t√© d√©montr√©e seulement
     soit jusqu'au temps de choc (√† partir duquel le gradient de la solution de (0.0.1)
     devient discontinu) ou sous une hypoth√®se de convexit√© de la surface initiale. Par
     ailleurs, la convergence que nous montrons a lieu dans un sens plus fort (celui de
     la convergence presque s√ªre) que les r√©sultats pr√©c√©dents. Notre preuve adapte la
     m√©thode introduite par Rezakhanlou dans [Rez01] dont l'id√©e sera expliqu√©e dans
     le Chapitre 3).
   ¬à Ensuite, dans le Chapitre 4 nous avons montr√© que, conform√©ment √† la conjecture
     de Wolf, les uctuations
                     ‚àö        de l'interface pour le mod√®le de Gates-Westcott croissent
     au plus comme log t (un r√©sultat analogue pour le mod√®le de Borodin-Ferrari a
     √©t√© montr√© dans [Ton17, CFT19]).
   ¬à Enn, dans le Chapitre 6 nous nous sommes int√©ress√©s aux ressemblances entre
     les deux mod√®les que nous avons √©tudi√©s. Nous avons montr√© que le mod√®le de
     Gates-Westcott est en fait en bijection avec une version continue du mod√®le de
     Borodin et Ferrari √† condition de changer les coordonn√©es spatio-temporelles et
     de g√©n√©raliser la notion de condition initiale (une premi√®re correspondance avait
     au pr√©alable d√©j√† √©t√© obtenue par Borodin et Ferrari dans [BF15] mais dans un
     contexte di√©rent). Des cons√©quences et perspective en lien avec cette bijection
     sont √©galement pr√©sent√©es √† la n du chapitre.

1.1 Interface growth models: physical motivations
Interfaces appear naturally in Biology and Physics when a system can be decomposed into
two (or more) spatial regions characterised by dierent structural properties e.g dierent
states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) or magnetisations.    The motion of the interface,
which is dened as the boundary between regions, may depend on the parameters of the
system (temperature, pressure, external magnetic eld...). For instance, what happens
to an ice cube dropped in a glass of water or to the ice layer on top of a frozen pond
is very dierent whether the temperature is above or is equal to     0   degree Celsius. In
the former case, the solid/liquid interface is shrinking until ice totally disappears (the
system is out of equilibrium) while in the latter, the interface relaxes until it reaches
equilibrium and the two states of matter persist. As often in Statistical Physics models,
strong assumptions are made to simplify the extremely complex and chaotic microscopic
particle interactions: the main one supposes that the microscopic elementary transitions
of a system are random. Think for instance of the growth of a snow layer due to snowakes
deposition. The motion of each individual snowake is erratic but we may reasonably
assume that they depose randomly on the surface of snow. Similar mechanisms may be
found in nature among crystal growth, sedimentation, expansion of a bacterial colony or
spin dynamics in ferromagnetic materials.
   The focus of the present work is on non-equilibrium random growth models, a large
variety of whom have been introduced in the last fty years (see e.g [BS95, KS91]     for a

nice introduction on the topic).   One of the main challenges is to explain how discrete

stochastic interface models, on the microscopic scale, can describe smooth and determin-

istic interface motions on the macroscopic scale. This may rst appear paradoxical but is

actually an instance of the well-known law of large numbers in mathematics. Remarkably

enough, on an intermediate mesoscopic scale, most random growth models are expected

to share the same characteristic features in relation with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)

stochastic partial dierential equation [KPZ86]: we speak of universality of uctuations.

   In dimension   1   (i.e when the interface is a curve), great mathematical progress has

been achieved in this direction, especially since 2000 [Cor12, Qua11]. However, in higher

dimensions (i.e when the interface is a general surface), much less is known (see e.g [Ton18]
for a survey on recent results). Our main contribution is to demonstrate rigorous law of
large numbers (called hydrodynamic limit in this context) for two-dimensional models
belonging to a specic universality class called Anisotropic KPZ.

1.1.1    Modelling by irreversible Markov chains
In order to explain and make predictions on a Physical system, we need to understand its
microscopic rules of evolution. Unfortunately, knowing precisely the microscopic state of
a system is almost impossible since it requires to take into account too much information
(e.g positions and speeds of a huge number of particles). Consequently, we have to make
simplications so as to obtain a model that is easy enough to do calculations but still
captures the main features of reality. The approach of statistical Physics is to consider
that the microscopic evolution of a system is given by random elementary transitions
(that can depend on some external parameters of the system such as pressure, tem-
perature, magnetic eld...). Mathematically speaking, the evolution of the microscopic
states is modelled by a Markov chain    which is a random process satisfying the so-called
Markov property: conditional on the present state, the future states are independent
from the past states. Markov chains are widely used in mathematical modelling for two
reasons: they are very easy to simulate numerically on a computer (they can be seen
as probabilistic automata) and they enjoy a rich theory developed for more than one
century.
    When the process started from equilibrium looks the same (meaning that its proba-
bility law is unchanged) when time is reversed, we say that the Markov chain is    reversible
and otherwise we say that it is   irreversible
                                             . The former case is used to model physical
systems at equilibrium while the latter describes systems out of equilibrium, which is
our situation of interest. Mathematically, reversible Markov chains enjoy nice tools com-
ing from the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators which make them easier to study
compared to irreversible Markov chains.

A rst introductory example: the Eden model
As an illustrating example, let us present a very simple model introduced by Murray
Eden in 1956 to describe bacterial colony expansion [Ede58]. Imagine that the plane
is tiled by squares and that initially, a single square is occupied. Then, at each step,
bacteria expand on a randomly chosen perimeter square of the cluster (i.e on a empty
square adjacent to an occupied square) as illustrated in Figure 1.1.
     Let us note C(n) the cluster obtained after n steps. The stochastic process (C(n))n‚ààN
is indeed a Markov chain since the elementary transition from step n to step n + 1 only
depends on the perimeter of C(n) and not on the past states C(0), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , C(n‚àí1). Moreover,
it is irreversible since the cluster can only grow with time.
     Even if C(n) is random and hence diers from one sample to another, we can try to
make predictions by studying its probability distribution. Are there shapes that come

interface growth models. In this context, the assumptions of the CLT are not satised and
the study of uctuations appears much more challenging than that of the hydrodynamic
limit. What numerical simulations of the Eden model show (see Figure 1.2b) is that the
standard deviation perpendicular to the limiting shape is of order t1/3 where t is the
                                                                                 ‚àö
characteristic length of the cluster (typically the radius which is here of order n after n
steps). Note that the exponent 1/3 is dierent from the exponent 1/2 appearing in the
CLT. Moreover, the typical correlation length parallel to the interface is of order t2/3 .
Even if there is still no mathematical proof of these facts for the Eden model and most
of other growth models, the characteristic exponents 1/3 and 2/3 are observed in most
simulations of one-dimensional interface models and are conjectured to be universal. In
addition, under rescaling as in Figure 1.2b, uctuations are conjectured to converge to
a stationary stochastic process called Airy process with a marginal distribution called
Tracy-Widom (as opposed to the Gaussian distribution coming from the CLT). At the
beginning of this century, rigorous results have been proven in the case of one-dimensional
"integrable" growth models (that will be introduced in the next section) including the
corner growth model [Joh00b] and the polynuclear growth model [BDJ99]. However,
much less is known in higher dimensions...

Towards KPZ universality
The intermediate mesoscopic scale is ne enough to see the random uctuations but is
coarse enough to ignore the microscopic details. Therefore, the main features of the
uctuations (characteristic exponents, limiting probability distribution...) are expected
not to depend on the choice of the model but only on the dimension and on the symmetries
of the system. Think for instance of random walks used to describe e.g the motion of a
gas particle colliding with other particles. Under general assumptions given by Donsker's
theorem, they all behave, on a large scale, like the Brownian motion named after the
botanist Robert Brown for his observations about the motion of pollen grains suspended
in water. In this sense, Brownian motion is said to be universal. Analogously, the KPZ
equation, called after Kardar, Parisi and Zhang was introduced in [KPZ86] as a universal
stochastic model of interface growth. Indeed, it is conjectured (and proven in some
particular cases but only in dimension 1) that, on a large scale, most growth models
behave like the KPZ equation: we speak of KPZ universality class. As we will explain in
the next section, there are dierent KPZ universality classes depending on the dimension
and on the symmetries of the system.


1.2 Scaling limits and (stochastic) partial dierential equa-
    tions
In this section, we will introduce more probabilistic and analytic notations aiming at
presenting the dierent equations that are supposed to describe the large scale motion
of interfaces including Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the hydrodynamic limits and the
KPZ equation for the uctuations.

    The invariant measures for the Corner Growth model are not known in higher dimen-
sions. However, in dimension 2, for a modication of the dynamic where an arbitrary
high stack of cubes may be added at each elementary transition (that will be introduced
in Section 2.3.2), the invariant measures can be expressed in terms of measures on dimer
congurations on the hexagonal lattice.

1.2.3   Hydrodynamic Limits and Hamilton-Jacobi equations
As explained in previous sections, on a macroscopic scale, the properly rescaled interface
seems to move deterministically with a local normal speed of expansion that may depend
on the orientation of the vector normal to the interface. The goal of this section is to
make this scaling precise and to introduce the notion of Hamilton-Jacobi equations that
are conjectured to rule the macroscopic motion of the interface.

Ballistic scaling
The ballistic scaling consists in rescaling space and time by the same factor L and thus
considering the following rescaled height function dened for all x ‚àà Rd and t ‚àà R+ by

                                               1
                                hL (x, t) :=     h( Lx, Lt),                      (1.2.5)
                                               L
where ¬∑ denotes the coordinate-wise oor function. In words, we zoom out on the
microscopic interface by a factor L and accelerate time by the same factor in order to
observe something non-trivial on this new scale. What we call informally "macroscopic
limit" has to be thought of as the limit when L tends to innity of this ballistic scaling.
    As a side remark, the ballistic scaling diers from the diusive scaling : hL (x, t) =
  ‚àí1
L h( Lx, L2 t) which appears for reversible interface models such as the one-dimensional
corner growth model with symmetric corner ips related to the Symmetric Simple Ex-
clusion Process (SSEP) whose rescaled prole converges to the solution of the heat equa-
tion [KL98].

Hydrodynamic limits and Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs
The hydrodynamic limit is often formulated in these terms. Let f : Rd ‚Üí R be any
continuous height prole and (hL (¬∑, 0))L‚ààN be a sequence of (possibly random) initial
height proles that we rescale ballistically as in (1.2.5). If, initially,

then, in a sense of convergence of random functions that has to be specied,

where u : Rd √ó R+ ‚Üí R is a continuous function which is solution of the following
non-linear rst-order Partial Dierential Equation (PDE) of Hamilton-Jacobi type:

                               u(¬∑, 0) = f        if t = 0.

In this equation, the function v is the same as the stationary speed of growth dened
in (1.2.2) and (‚àív ) is more conventionally called the Hamiltonian. By the assumptions
made on the discrete growth models (homogeneous in space and time and vertically
translation invariant), the speed function v simply depends on the gradients of u but not
on t, x or u.
Remark   1.2.1. Even if equation (1.2.8) gives the local vertical speed of expansion of the
macroscopic interface as a function of the inclination its tangent vector, this is equivalent
to giving the normal speed of expansion of the interface as a function of the orientation of
the normal vector, modulo changing the coordinate system as explained in [KS91, Section
2].
     Heuristically, under the ballistic space-time scaling, we expect the height prole to be
locally at equilibrium everywhere with a slope parameter œÅ corresponding to the macro-
scopic gradients ‚àáu of the prole. Given that the average growth rate at stationarity is
given by v(œÅ), the temporal derivative ‚àÇt u of the macroscopic prole is thus expected to
be equal to v(‚àáu). This is illustrated in Figure 1.7
     For one-dimensional spaces, Hamilton-Jacobi equations are equivalent (modulo spa-
tial dierentiation/integration of the solution) to transport equations arising e.g in the
macroscopic limit of interacting particle systems. In addition, since evolving height func-
tions are often in bijection with interacting particle systems with stationary measures of
i.i.d type, the proof of hydrodynamic limits in dimension one is often much easier than
in higher dimension. As an example, the hydrodynamic limit for the 1-d Corner Growth
model (or equivalently for the TASEP) is a classical result proven e.g in [KL98]. In this
case, the Hamiltonian is explicit and is given by (1.2.4). Other examples of hydrodynamic
limits beyond the case of explicit stationary measures and in a random environment set-
ting can be found in [BGRS19] for a family of asymmetric 1-d interacting particle systems
called misanthrope processes (including TASEP and the zero-range process).

Formation of shocks and viscosity solutions
When dealing with PDEs, one should pay attention to the well-posedness of the problem:
what notion of solution should we dene in order to guarantee existence and uniqueness?
For the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (1.2.8), under extra regularity assumptions on f and
v , it is possible to apply the method of characteristics to obtain a classical solution in a

    As we will explain in Section 2.1.3, when the growth models satisfy a microscopic
property called "envelope property" or sometimes "strong monotonicity", there exist
standard arguments based on sub-additivity to show that the rescaled height function
converges to the Hopf-Lax formula of a certain Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a Hamilto-
nian that is necessarily convex (or concave). For this reason, most hydrodynamic results
(in multiple-dimensional spaces) are shown in this setting. Our main contribution in
this thesis is to develop techniques introduced by Rezakhanlou [Rez01] to demonstrate
hydrodynamic limits for two-dimensional interface growth models with neither convex
nor concave Hamiltonian, for which that standard method fails.

introduce the KPZ equation, a non-linear stochastic partial dierential equation (SPDE)
conjectured to capture the large-scale behaviour of uctuations of interface growth mod-
els. Then, we state some asymptotic properties of the "solution" depending on the
dimension and on the signature of the non-linearity. Finally, we state the Wolf conjec-
ture for the bi-dimensional case and dene the Anisotropic KPZ universality class, which
is the class we focus on in this thesis.

The KPZ equation
As explained before, Kardar, Parisi and Zhang introduced in [KPZ86] a non-linear SPDE
as a universal model for stochastic interface growth. The KPZ equation can be written
as follows:                                             ‚àö
                          ‚àÇt h = ŒΩ Œîh + Œª ‚àáh, H ‚àáh + D Œæ,                    (1.2.10)
where ŒΩ , Œª and D are positive parameters, H is a symmetric d √ó d matrix and Œæ is a
space-time white noise. The Laplacian term and the white noise in the equation stand
respectively for the local smoothing mechanism and the random increase of height that
are visible on a mesoscopic scale. The non-linear term takes into account the slope-
dependent growth: the matrix H has to be thought of as the Hessian of the speed of
growth v (appearing in the hydrodynamic limit (1.2.8)) evaluated at some slope œÅ:

                                      H = DœÅ2 (v).                              (1.2.11)

Indeed, if we write the gradient of the height function as œÅ + ‚àáh (where ‚àáh is a lower
order uctuating term around the macroscopic slope œÅ), a second order Taylor expansion
of v around œÅ yields

and the rst two terms can be eliminated from the KPZ equation by a linear change of
coordinates: hÃÉ(x, t) := h(x ‚àí DœÅ (v) t, t) ‚àí v(œÅ) t.
Remark 1.2.2. This change of coordinates corresponds to subtracting the average growth
v(œÅ) t and following the height function along the characteristic lines of the Hamilton-
Jacobi equation (1.2.8) whose equations are of the type x = x0 ‚àí DœÅ (v) t.
    Let us point out that, because of the non-linear term and the irregularity of white
noise, the KPZ equation is singular and some care must be taken to dene a notion of
solution. This a highly challenging question that we won't address: several approaches
have been developed recently in this direction such as regularity structures [Hai14] and
paracontrolled distributions that work, in the case of the KPZ equation only for d = 1
(see e.g [GP16] for a panorama on the topic). Alternatively, the solution can be dened by
regularising the noise or by means of the so-called Hopf-Cole transform (when H = Id).

Asymptotic behaviour and relevance/irrelevance of non-linearity
In this section, we ask ourselves about the asymptotic behaviour of the solution to the
KPZ equation. Namely, depending on the dimension of space, we may wonder what is the
eect of the non-linearity in (1.2.10) when Œª is small compared to the case Œª = 0 which
corresponds to the so-called Edward Wilkinson equation a.k.a stochastic heat equation:
                                                 ‚àö
                                    ‚àÇt h = ŒΩ Œîh + D Œæ.                          (1.2.13)

This equation is linear and standard techniques (see e.g the lecture notes of Hairer
[Hai09]) allow to dene a solution (in the sense of distributions when d ‚â• 2). In particular,
the probability distribution of the solution is asymptotically Gaussian and its asymptotic
correlations can be described by the dimension-dependent characteristic exponents:
                                 2‚àíd         2‚àíd
                        Œ±EW =        , Œ≤EW =     , zEW = 2,                         (1.2.14)
                                  2           4
where Œ± is the roughness exponent (the stationary spatial uctuations are of order xŒ± ),
Œ≤ is the growth exponent (the temporal uctuations are of order tŒ≤ ) and z is the dynamic
exponent (the correlation length at time t is of order t1/z ) which is, almost by denition,
equal to Œ±/Œ≤ (we refer to [BS95] for an introduction to characteristic exponents). These
exponents are also scaling exponents. For instance the Edward Wilkinson equation is
exactly invariant under rescaling by ŒµŒ±EW h(x/Œµ, t/Œµ2 ). Note that dimension two is critical
because Œ±EW = Œ≤EW = 0 and, in this case, the spatial and temporal uctuations actually
grow logarithmically. Models behaving asymptotically like the solution of (1.2.13) belong
to the Edward Wilkinson universality class.
    If the large-scale features of the solution to the KPZ equation with Œª > 0 is dierent
from that with Œª = 0 (i.e when the KPZ and EW universality classes are distinct),
we say that the non-linearity is relevant and otherwise, we say that the non-linearity is
irrelevant. Let us remark that, in addition to the equation z = Œ±/Œ≤ , in the case where the
non-linearity is relevant, the KPZ exponents are related by Œ±KP Z +zKP Z = 2 (in contrast
with zEW = 2) and thus knowing one exponent is enough to recover all the others. In

what follows, we present some known results about the KPZ equation depending on the
dimension.

   ¬à If d = 1, the properties of the solution to the KPZ equation (exact marginal dis-
     tribution, asymptotics, stationary measure...) are now well-known. In particular,
     the characteristic exponents are given by
                                     1         1         3
                              Œ±KP Z = , Œ≤KP Z = , zKP Z = ,                           (1.2.15)

       and the asymptotic marginal distribution of h i.e the distribution of h(x, t) nor-
       malised by t1/3 for xed x and large t is of Tracy-Widom type (depending on the
       geometry of the initial condition). Since these exponents are dierent from those
       of (1.2.14) for d = 1, the non-linearity is relevant.
       Let us remark that most properties of the KPZ solution (such as the exact one-
       point distribution) were originally obtained thanks to the study of microscopic
       growth models and for two reasons. First of all, Bertini and Giacomin showed
       in [BG97] that a weakly asymmetric version of the corner growth model converges
       to the Hopf-Cole solution of the KPZ equation. Then, since 2000, spectacular
       progress has been made about the uctuations of some growth models such as
       the (partially asymmetric) corner growth model or the polynuclear growth model
       (showing, in particular, that they indeed share the universal KPZ exponents). We
       refer to [Cor12, Qua11] for an overview on results around the 1-d KPZ equation
       and universality class.

   ¬à If d ‚â• 3 and H = Id, it has been shown very recently [MU18, DGRZ19] that,
     for all small enough Œª, the Hopf-Cole solution to the KPZ equation rescaled by
     ŒµŒ±EW (h(x/Œµ, t/Œµ2 ) ‚àí E[h(x/Œµ, t/Œµ2 ]) (with Œ±EW as in (1.2.14)) converges (in distri-
     bution and in the sense of convergence of moments) to the solution of the Edward
     Wilkinson equation (where the diusion and noise parameters depend on Œª). The
     (small) non-linearity is thus irrelevant. It is believed that the same should hold,
     for H = Id (but then there is no more Hopf-Cole transform to show it).

The case of dimension 2 and Wolf's conjecture
Dimension 2 is in some sense critical: the asymptotics of the solution to the KPZ equation
is expected to depend highly on the signature of H or, equivalently, on the convexity
properties of the speed of growth v by (1.2.11) (see [Pr√§03, Section 2.2] for heuristics
coming from perturbations of the hydrodynamic limit). In 1991, based on perturbative

renormalisation-group arguments [Wol91], Dietrich E. Wolf conjectured the following

picture.



   ¬à   If   det(H) > 0 (meaning that v   is strictly convex or concave), then the non-linearity

       is relevant and

       computed by numerical simulations [TFW92, HHP14] that are precise enough to
       rule out the value 1/4 for Œ≤KP Z . The KPZ relation Œ±KP Z + zKP Z = 2 is also
       veried numerically. We call the associated universality class Isotropic KPZ or
       simply KPZ.

     ¬à If det(H) ‚â§ 0, then
                                    Œ±KP Z = 0 Œ≤KP Z = 0,                           (1.2.17)

       as for the stochastic heat equation in dimension 2. Wolf also conjectured that
       the spatial and temporal uctuations should grow logarithmically as conrmed
       numerically soon after by Halpin-Healyand and Assdah [HHA92] and shown for
       the Gates-Westcott model by Spohn and Pr√§hofer [PS97] (only for the spatial
       uctuations though). The universality class associated to the bi-dimensional KPZ
       equation with det(H) ‚â§ 0 is called Anisotropic KPZ (AKPZ) class. The name
       "anisotropic" comes from the fact that the eigenvalues of H have dierent signs,
       indicating an absence of symmetry in the microscopic models.

    In the original paper of Wolf [Wol91], it was conjectured that, in the latter case,
the non-linearity is irrelevant i.e the APKZ and Edward-Wilkinson universality classes
coincide. However, the conjecture is not precise enough to claim that a result as strong as
in dimension 3 should hold. On the contrary, in the recent work [CET20] of Cannizzaro,
Erhard and Toninelli, the authors showed that logarithmic corrections have to be added
to the diusive scaling in order to obtain a non-trivial limit. More precisely, they showed
that the stationary solution to the mollied AKPZ equation (with H the diagonal matrix
with entries +1 and ‚àí1) is superdiusive and that the diusion coecient diverges like
a power of log t. Since, for the EW equation, the diusion coecient is independent of t,
this suggests a dierent large-scale behaviour between the AKPZ and the EW equations,
contrarily to Wolf's conjecture. In any case, as remarked by the authors, their conclusion
is not in contradiction with the asymptotic logarithmic growth of the height variance at
a single point which could be a feature shared by the equations with or without non
linearity.


1.3 Goals and organisation of the Thesis
While one-dimensional growth models in the KPZ universality class are now quite well un-
derstood, supported by many results about hydrodynamic limits and uctuations shown
in the last decades, much less is known in higher dimensions. The class of bi-dimensional
growth models in the AKPZ universality class has enjoyed recent progress in the last
few years (see [Ton18] for a survey and Chapters 2 and 3 for more context). One of the
main reasons for this progress in the AKPZ class comes from the existence of explicit
stationary measures [PS97, CF17, Ton17, CT16, CFT19] while none of those are known
for models in the KPZ class in dimension 2 or higher. Let us briey present the main
results of this thesis (we refer to Chapter 3 for precise statements).


1.3. GOALS AND ORGANISATION OF THE THESIS                                              17

1.3.1    Informal description of the main results of the thesis
In this thesis, we focus on two bi-dimensional models in the AKPZ class: the Gates-
Westcott model and the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic. Both of these models have been
studied before and more context will be given in Chapters 2 and 3. The former is a layer
by layer crystal growth model introduced in [GW95] generalising the one-dimensional
Polynuclear Growth model and whose stationary measures have been previously studied
by Spohn and Prahofer in [PS97]. The latter is an interlaced particles dynamic introduced
by Borodin and Ferrari in [BF14] and generalised in [Ton17] which can be seen as a version
of the bi-dimensional Corner Growth model (introduced in Section 1.2.1) where several
adjacent cubes in a same stack can be removed simultaneously. The invariant measures
have been studied by Toninelli in [Ton17]. The main results of this thesis can be summed
up as follows:


   ¬à   Hydrodynamic limit for the Gates-Westcott model and Borodin-Ferrari dynamics.
       In the latter case, our result generalises that obtained by Legras and Toninelli
       in [LT18] where the hydrodynamic limit was shown only either up to the rst
       time where the solution develops shocks or for convex initial height proles. For
       both models, we obtained the convergence of the rescaled height prole to the vis-
       cosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation at all time, for all
       initial prole for which the hydrodynamic limit makes sense and in a strong almost-
       sure sense of convergence (whereas all previous results hold for the convergence in
       probability). As explained before, this cannot be shown thanks to classical enve-
       lope property and sub-additive arguments because we are dealing with non-convex
       Hamiltonian, by denition of the AKPZ class. Instead, we adapt an approach
       based on semi-groups introduced by Rezakhanlou in [Rez01] (the main ideas will
       be explained in Chapter 3).

   ¬à   Logarithmic upper bound for the variance of the temporal growth for the stationary
       Gates-Westcott model, in agreement with Wolf's conjecture (the corresponding
       upper bound for the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic was obtained in [Ton17, CFT19]).

   ¬à   A new bijection between the Gates-Westcott model and a continuous version of the
       Borodin-Ferrari dynamic. We show that the Gates-Westcott model is in bijection
       with a continuous space limit of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic modulo a rotation of
       the coordinates (and of the boundary condition). Our approach diers from that
       of Borodin and Ferrari who showed in [BF15] (only for a specic initial condition)
       that a discrete time version of their dynamic with parallel update was in bijection
       with the domino shuing algorithm for the aztec diamond (which was known to be
       in bijection with the discrete Gates-Westcott model in a droplet geometry [PS02,
       Joh00a]). Finally, we show a hydrodynamic limit for the Gates-Westcott model
       with generalised boundary conditions and, as a corollary, a hydrodynamic limit for
       the continuous limit of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic.

1.3.2     Organisation of the thesis
     ¬à In Chapter 2, the goal is to dene the Gates-Westcott and Borodin-Ferrari models.
       In order to better understand these models, we rst introduce their one-dimensional
       analogues: the Polynuclear Growth model and the Hammersley process. We also
       show how we can derive a hydrodynamic limit for models with convex Hamiltonian
       (such as the Polynuclear Growth model and its higher dimensional isotropic gener-
       alisations) by using general arguments based on the so-called "envelope property"
       and on sub-additive arguments.

     ¬à In Chapter 3, rigorous statements of our main results are stated. We also explain
       the idea of the proofs, the novelty w.r.t previous methods and give some perspec-
       tives for future works.

     ¬à In Chapter 4, we prove the hydrodynamic limit for the Gates-Westcott model and
       the logarithmic upper bound on the variance of the height function. This is the
       content of the article [Ler20], published on 8 July 2020 in Electronic Journal of
       Probability.

     ¬à In Chapter 5, based on a joint work with Fabio Toninelli [LT20], we show how to
       extend the hydrodynamic limit result of [LT18] to all time (namely after the time
       of shocks) and to general initial proles.

     ¬à In Chapter 6, we give a precise graphical construction of the Gates-Westcott model
       with generalised boundary conditions. Then, we show how it yields a bijection
       between the Gates-Westcott model and a continuous limit of Borodin-Ferrari dy-
       namics. Finally, we show a hydrodynamic limit for this model with generalised
       boundary conditions, give some corollaries and perspectives.


Chapter 2
Presentation of the models
The main purpose of this Chapter is to introduce the models of interest of this thesis:
the Gates-Westcott and Borodin-Ferrari dynamics. Before that, it is useful to introduce
their one-dimensional analogues: the Polynuclear Growth model (a.k.a PNG) and the
Hammersley process. We also make a little detour to present the envelope property
mentioned in Chapter 1 and explain how it can be used together with sub-additive
arguments to obtain a hydrodynamic limit with convex (or concave) Hamiltonian, as it
is the case for the PNG and its isotropic multi-dimensional generalisations. Let us stress
once more that this method doesn't apply to anisotropic models such as the Gates-
Westcott and Borodin-Ferrari models and that our results rely on a dierent approach
that will be explained in Chapter 3.

2.1 Models in dimension 1
Even if the corner growth model (introduced briey in Chapter 1) is maybe the most
classical one-dimensional interface growth model, we rather focus on the PNG and on
the Hammersley process that serve as preliminary examples before introducing their 2-d
analogues in Section 2.3.

2.1.1   The Polynuclear Growth Model
The PNG can be seen as a simple one-dimensional model that can describe e.g the growth
of a crystal in contact with its gaseous phase. The pressure is higher than gas-solid
equilibrium pressure so that atoms deposition on the surface of the crystal dominates
evaporation (that will be neglected). The crystal is modelled by a stack of microscopic
terraces. For energetic reasons, atom deposition is faster on the kinks of the terraces
than away from their edges. For this reason, in the PNG model, the terraces expand
laterally at constant speed while deposition away from the edges happens at rare random
locations. In Sections 2.2 and 2.3, we will see bidimensional generalisations of the PNG
that are physically more realistic.

20                                  CHAPTER 2. PRESENTATION OF THE MODELS
    Let us start by dening the space of height functions for the PNG before presenting
the dynamic.

Height functions
In this model, the interface is described by a discrete height function h : R ‚Üí Z which is
piece-wise constant with a locally nite number of ¬±1-valued jumps as in Figure 2.1. By
convention, we impose that the values at discontinuity points make the function upper
semi-continuous. Therefore, the discontinuities can be of three dierent types:

     ¬à kink : h(x‚àí ) = h(x) = h(x+ ) + 1

     ¬à antikink : h(x‚àí ) + 1 = h(x) = h(x+ )

     ¬à kink-antikink pair : h(x‚àí ) + 1 = h(x) = h(x+ ) + 1.

The kinks and antikinks dene the variations of the height function. Therefore, the
height function is entirely determined by the height at the origin and the position of the
kinks/antikinks. Notice that the interface here is not discrete but semi-discrete since the
height function is dened from R into Z.

Dynamic
The evolution of the height prole of the PNG relies on three mechanisms: the rst two
are deterministic while the last one is random.

     ¬à Lateral Expansion : each terrace expands laterally at speed 1, i.e. each kink (resp.
       antikink) of the height function is moved at speed +1 (resp ‚àí1).

     ¬à Annihilation : whenever two terraces meet, they merge, i.e. whenever a kink and
       an antikink meet, they annihilate each other.

     ¬à Creation : At uniformly random space-time positions (x, t), a new elementary
       terrace (i.e an antikink/kink pair) is created at position x and at time t which
       means that the height function at x increases by 1 at time t: h(x, t) = h(x, t‚àí ) + 1.

    The locations where creations occur is given by a Poisson Point Process (PPP) of
intensity 2 on R2 which is a probabilistic object that samples points uniformly at random
in the plane with an average density equal to 2.
Remark 2.1.1. The intensity of the PPP could be any other positive real number but
the constant 2 is a standard choice (made to simplify calculations). Likewise, the speed
of lateral expansion could be any other positive number but we don't lose generality by
xing it to 1 modulo a time rescaling.
Remark 2.1.2. Since the set of discontinuities of the height function is countable, with
probability one, creations never happen on an terrace edge and thus, at any time, the
height function is piece-wise constant with ¬±1-valued jumps.

22                                CHAPTER 2. PRESENTATION OF THE MODELS
Hammersley process and higher dimensional generalisations [Sep07], ballistic deposition
[Sep00] and a wider class of models [Rez02] (although the Hamiltonian is never explicit
apart from one-dimensional cases with explicit invariant measures). This method can
also be adapted to the Eden model introduced in Chapter 1 even though the interface
is not given by a height function (the hydrodynamic limit makes sense by seeing the
interface as the level line of a function that satises, in the limit, a Hamilton-Jacobi
equation).
The envelope property
A very useful property to compare microscopic height proles started from dierent initial
conditions is the monotonicity a.k.a attractiveness property. This means that, under the
natural coupling that consists in using the same Poisson Point Process, the usual partial
order between height functions is preserved by the dynamic. For instance, if we note
(x, t) ‚Üí h(x, t; œï, œâ) the height function following the PNG dynamic started from the
initial height prole œï and with realisation of the PPP œâ, then, for any t ‚â• 0,
                           œï1 ‚â§ œï2 ‚áí h(¬∑, t; œï1 , œâ) ‚â§ h(¬∑, t; œï2 , œâ).              (2.1.2)
The envelope property is a stronger property sometimes called strong monotonicity. It
says that for any family of initial height functions (œïi )i‚ààI such that supi‚ààI œïi is also an
admissible height function, for any t ‚â• 0,
                             h(¬∑, t; sup œïi , œâ) = sup h(¬∑, t; œïi , œâ).              (2.1.3)
                                  i‚ààI          i‚ààI

    It can be shown that the PNG satises this property by using only the denition
of the dynamic. Moreover, there exists a family of initial conditions called droplet or
narrow-wedge that are minimal in some sense and such that any height function can be
expressed as the superior envelope of such functions. Indeed, if we note œïdrop the height
function that takes value 0 at the origin and ‚àí‚àû elsewhere, then we have that for any
initial height function œï and any x ‚àà R,
                            œï(x) = sup{œï(y) + œïdrop (x ‚àí y)}.                      (2.1.4)
                                    y‚ààR

The droplet initial condition can be seen as a degenerate height function where there is
only one elementary terrace located at 0 at time 0 that expands laterally at speed one
and where the creations can only occur above this primitive terrace (see Figure 2.2a).
This is equivalent to restricting the PPP to the set of points (x, t) such that |x|‚â§ t. If
we call hdrop the height function following the PNG dynamic started from œïdrop, then,
by (2.1.3), (2.1.4) and vertical translation invariance of the model, the height function
can be expressed at all time t ‚â• 0 by the following microscopic variational formula:
                                           
                  h(¬∑, t; œï, œâ) =   sup      œï(y) + hdrop (x ‚àí y, t; Œ∏y œâ) ,       (2.1.5)
                                y‚àà[x‚àít,x+t]

where Œ∏y œâ is the spatial translation of œâ by ‚àíy. Notice that the supremum can be
restricted to the interval [x ‚àí t, x + t] because hdrop(x, t) = ‚àí‚àû if |x|> t.

The convergence of the ballistically rescaled PNG droplet to the limit shape given by the
function g is illustrated numerically in Figure 2.2b.

Existence of hydrodynamic limits
The hydrodynamic limit can be easily obtained by taking the limit (thanks to the super-
additive ergodic theorem) in the microscopic variational formula given by the envelope
property. Doing so, one obtains a macroscopic variational formula which is exactly the
Hopf-Lax formula (reminded in Section 1.2.3) associated to some Hamilton-Jacobi with
Hamiltonian related to the speed of growth of stationary states (if they are known).
    The hydrodynamic limit for the PNG can be formulated as follows. Assume that
initially, we are given a sequence of (possibly random) initial height proles (œïL )L‚ààN
whose scaling limit converges (say point-wise and in probability) to a continuous function
f : R ‚Üí R. After rescaling ballistically the variational formula (2.1.5), we have for all
x ‚àà R and t ‚â• 0,

Explicit expression of the Hamiltonian thanks to stationary states
Finally, one can obtain an explicit expression of the Hamiltonian and the limit shape g if
one knows the stationary measures. Here, the PNG stationary measure of slope œÅ ‚àà R is
the law of a bi-lateral random walk that jumps by +1 at rate œÅ+ and by ‚àí1 at rate œÅ‚àí with
œÅ+ , œÅ‚àí > 0 satisfying that œÅ+ ‚àí œÅ‚àí = œÅ and œÅ+ œÅ‚àí = 1 (so that the rate of annihilations
and creations are balanced as explained in [Pr√§03, Chapter 3]). By denition of the PNG
dynamic, the speed of growth is given by the sum of the stationary densities of kinks and
antikinks i.e v(œÅ) = œÅ+ + œÅ‚àí = 4 + œÅ2 , as a elementary computation shows. Since the

hydrodynamic limit must hold in particular for linear macroscopic initial proles (that
can be approximated microscopically by stationary height proles whose average speed
of growth is known), one deduces that

and then, by concave duality, we can recover the equation of the limit shape of the droplet
initial condition given by the function g in (2.1.7)

Let us stress once again that in higher dimensions, due to a lack of explicit invariant
measures, there is no known hydrodynamic limit with explicit Hamiltonians apart from
some models in the AKPZ class for which we need to use an alternative method that will
be explained in details in this thesis.

2.1.4    Link with Ulam's problem and context
In this section, we explain briey how the PNG and the Hammersley process are related
to Ulam's problem that consists in estimating the longest increasing subsequence of a
random permutation. For this, we introduce the graphical constructions of these models
which will be used in Chapters 4, 5 and even more in Chapter 6. We also take a little
detour to introduce a bit of context about Ulam's problem and the progress realised in
the last 50 years.

Graphical construction and link of the PNG and Hammersley processes
In order to see the link with increasing sequences of permutations, it is useful to introduce
the graphical construction of the PNG (and similarly for the Hammersley process).
    The idea is to draw the sequence of space-time level lines of the PNG height function
given the initial height function and the realisation of the underlying Poisson Point
Process. These level lines are given by the space-time trajectories of kinks and antikinks,
which are straight lines oriented respectively North-Eastward and North-Westward (since
they move at speed ¬±1). Because of the annihilation rule, whenever two such straight
lines touch each other, they stop. Finally, due to the creation rule, we draw two straight
lines going North-East and North-West starting from each Poisson point. This gives
a well-dened graphical procedure to obtain the level lines of the PNG as shown in
Figure 2.3a.
    Then, the height dierence h(x, t) ‚àí h(y, s) with (y, s) in the backward light cone
of (x, t) i.e |y ‚àí x|‚â§ t ‚àí s, is equal to the number of level lines crossed by a light-path
starting from (y, s) and ending at (x, t) i.e a continuous path Œ≥ : [0, 1] ‚Üí R2 such that
for any a ‚â§ b, Œ≥(b) is in the forward light cone of Œ≥(a). Notice that this light-path
has to stay in the light-rectangle R(y,s),(x,t) which we dene as the intersection of the
backward light cone of (x, t) with the forward light-cone of (y, s). It is easy to see that

is equal to the maximal length of a sequence i1 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , ik such that xi1 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < xik and
ti1 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < tik , which only depends on the relative order of the xi and of the ti . If we
note œÉ , the unique permutation of 1, n such that the x1 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , xn are in the same relative
order as the tœÉ(1) , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , tœÉ(n) , then, we have

        hdrop (x, t) = L(œÉ) := max{k, ‚àÉi1 < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < ik , œÉ(i1 ) < ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ < œÉ(ik )},       (2.1.15)

and œÉ is a permutation of 1, n(œâ, x, t) whose law is uniform conditional on n(œâ, x, t),
which is a Poisson random variable of mean t2 ‚àí x2 . Ulam's problem consists in studying
the law of Ln := L(œÉ) when œÉ is a permutation of 1, n with n constant and large.
Remark   2.1.4. As we will explain more in details in Chapter 6, the PNG droplet is in
bijection, modulo the change of coordinates (x , t ) = (x + t, t ‚àí x), with the Hammersley
process where all the particles stand initially at +‚àû and can land only on R+ when they
jump. Therefore, the Hammersley process is also closely related to Ulam's problem.
    Ulam's problem was introduced in 1961 by Ulam in [Ula61]. He conjectured that
         ‚àö
Ln ‚àº c n as n goes to innity. It was then studied and popularised by Hammersley
in [Ham72] who showed that n‚àí1/2 Ln indeed converges (in probability) to a constant
c ‚àà [1, e] where e is Euler's constant. In 1977, it was proven by Logan and Shepp [LS77]
and independently by Vershik and Kerov [VK77,VK85] that c = 2. Aldous and Diaconis
gave an alternative proof in [AD95] by dening the Hammersley process that they named
after the particle process introduced by Hammersley in [Ham72]. Notice that this can also
be proven thanks to the hydrodynamic limit of the PNG discussed in Section 2.1.3  ‚àö which
yields, as a corollary, the asymptotic shape of the droplet: hdrop (Lx, Lt) ‚àº 2L t2 ‚àí x2
(by (2.1.7) and (2.1.12)) which can be related to Ln by (2.1.15) with n ‚âà L2 (t2 ‚àí x2 ). It
took longer to nd the order of the uctuations of Ln . In 1999, Baik, Deift and Johansson
proved in [BDJ99] that the uctuations where of order n1/6 and they also found out that
the rescaled asymptotic distribution converges to a Tracy-Widom random variable as
for the largest eigenvalue of a GUE n √ó n random matrix; at that time, this appeared
surprising and remarkable.
    As a consequence, by (2.1.15), the uctuations of the PNG droplet at time t is of
order t1/3 and the rescaled asymptotic distribution is a GUE Tracy-Widom distribution,
as expected for models in the one-dimensional KPZ universality class. The asymptotic
distribution of uctuations starting from other geometries such as the at initial condi-
tion i.e h(x, 0) = 0 for all x and the stationary initial condition are dierent from the
droplet case (GOE Tracy-Widom in the former case) and were obtained soon after by
Baik and Rains respectively in [BR01b,BR01a] and in [BR00]. Moreover, the asymptotic
spatial joint distribution of the PNG (properly rescaled according to the KPZ character-
istic exponents) in the droplet and at geometries were obtained respectively by Spohn
and Pr√§hofer in [PS02] and by Ferrari in [Fer04]. The associated limiting processes are
respectively Airy 2 and Airy 1 processes which are one dimensional stationary stochas-
tic processes with GUE (resp. GOE) Tracy-Widom marginal distribution. This is also
typical for the KPZ universality class. We refer to [FP06] for a review on the PNG and
related models.

2.3. ANISOTROPIC MODELS IN DIMENSION TWO                                                  29

2.3 Anisotropic models in dimension two
The purpose of this section is to introduce the main two models of interest in this thesis
i.e the Gates-Westcott model and the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic, for which we will show
hydrodynamic limits. These models have a slope-dependent speed of growth that is
neither concave nor convex and thus, as explained before, there is no hope to apply
the general arguments based on the envelope property and sub-additivity presented in
Section 2.1.3. However, contrarily to their isotropic analogues, we can take advantage of
the good understanding of the invariant measures of these two models.

2.3.1    The Gates-Westcott model
The Gates-Westcott model can be seen as a bidimensional generalisation of the Polynu-
clear Growth model seen in Section 2.1.1. It has been introduced originally by Gates and
Westcott in [GW95] as a layer by layer crystal growth model in dimension 2; the rst
with explicit stationary distributions. This model was studied soon after by Spohn and
Pr√§hofer in [PS97] who completed the description of stationary states and computed the
speed of growth and the asymptotic spatial variance.
Height function and dynamic
In this model representing the evolution of a slice of a crystal out of equilibrium, the
interface is described by a discrete height function h : R √ó Z ‚Üí Z such that,
    ¬à for each y ‚àà Z, x ‚Üí h(x, y) is an admissible PNG height function i.e it is piece-wise
      constant with locally nite ¬±1-valued jumps and upper semi-continuous,
    ¬à the following slope constraint along y is satised : for any (x, y) ‚àà R √ó Z, we have

                                 h(x, y + 1) ‚àí h(x, y) ‚àà {‚àí1, 0}.                     (2.3.1)
As for the PNG, the discontinuities along x can be of three types: kink, antikink or
kink-antikink pair (see Section 2.1.1). The interface described by such height function
looks like a stack of terraces seen from above, as shown in Figure 2.5.
    Then, the Gates-Westcott dynamic can be informally expressed as follows. For all
line y ‚àà Z, the one-dimensional height functions x ‚Üí h(x, y) follow simultaneously the
PNG dynamic with creations accepted only if they preserve the slope constraint given by
(2.3.1). This leads to non-trivial correlations along y that makes the model much more
complicated than the PNG. More precisely, the dynamic is given by three rules: the rst
two are deterministic while the last one is random.
    ¬à Lateral Expansion : each terrace expands laterally at speed 1, i.e. each kink (resp.
      antikink) of the height function moves at speed +1 (resp ‚àí1) along the x direction.
    ¬à Annihilation : whenever two terraces meet, they merge, i.e. whenever a kink and
      an antikink meet, they annihilate each other.

of i.i.d type. Based on fermionic Fock spaces techniques, they showed that the stationary
measures have a determinental structure (with kink/antikink correlations decaying like
the inverse of the distance squared) and were able to compute the associated speed of

Since the determinant of the Hessian of the speed function v can be shown to be strictly
negative at any slope in R √ó (‚àí1, 0), this models falls in the AKPZ class. Moreover, the
asymptotic analysis carried out by Spohn and Pr√§hofer shows that the spatial variance of
the height dierences in the stationary states behaves logarithmically, which is a typical
feature of the Gaussian Free Field and Edward-Wilkinson universality class. At that
time, this was an important result supporting Wolf's conjecture.

2.3.2    Borodin-Ferrari dynamic
Let us now introduce a bidimensional interlaced particle process generalising a discrete-
space version of the Hammersley process (introduced in Section 2.1.2). As we will see,
this model is equivalent to that introduced by Borodin and Ferrari in [BF14] and thus
we will refer to it as the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic.

Interlaced particle conguration and dynamic

In this model, particles lie on a bidimensional lattice which consists in an innite col-
lection of discrete horizontal lines labelled by an index  ‚àà Z. As for the Hammersley
process, each line  contains an innite number of particles labelled by (p, ) with p ‚àà Z.
The horizontal position of particle (p, ) is denoted by z(p,) ‚àà Z + ( mod 2)/2 (notice
that adjacent horizontal lines are shifted by 1/2) and satises z(p,) < z(p+1,) . We will
consider interlaced particle congurations as in Figure 2.6. This means that for any
(p, ) ‚àà Z √ó Z, there exists a unique p ‚àà Z such that z(p,) < z(p ,+1) < z(p+1,) (and
as consequence, also a unique p ‚àà Z such that z(p,) < z(p ,‚àí1) < z(p+1,) ). Modulo
relabelling the particles, one can assume, without loss of generality that p = p (and thus
p = p + 1).
     Now, let us give an informal description of the dynamic. For all line  ‚àà Z, the
particle congurations (z(p,) )p‚ààZ follow simultaneously the discrete Hammersley process
(where discrete means that the particle jumps are given by a PPP on Z instead of R)
with jumps cancelled if the interlacement condition is violated (see Figure 2.6). Notice
that, as for the Gates-Westcott model, this leads to non-trivial correlations between lines.
More precisely, we associate a PPP of intensity 1 on R+ independently to each site (, z)
such that  ‚àà Z and z ‚àà Z+(mod2)/2. When the clock labelled (, z) rings, the leftmost
particle to the right of z (let (p, ) be its label) jumps to position z if z(p‚àí1,+1) < z and
z(p,‚àí1) < z and otherwise nothing happens.
     As for the Hammersley process, in order to ensure that the dynamic is well dened,
one needs to impose the following additional condition:
                               ‚àÄ ‚àà Z,     lim p‚àí2 z(p,) = 0.                         (2.3.3)

34                                 CHAPTER 2. PRESENTATION OF THE MODELS
Stationary states and previous results
In [Ton17], Fabio Toninelli studied a generalisation of this model where particles can
jump in both directions i.e particles attempt to jump at any site on its left and on its
right and does it respectively at rates p and q such that p + q = 1 (the case p = 1 and
q = 0 coincides with Borodin-Ferrari dynamic). He identied a family of explicit invariant
measures which are more easily expressed in terms of rhombi tilings (or equivalently dimer
congurations). For any œÅ = (œÅ1 , œÅ2 ) such that 0 < œÅ1 , œÅ2 and œÅ1 + œÅ2 < 1, the stationary
measures œÄœÅ whose height dierences have average slope œÅ (in the coordinate system
given by the unit vectors e1 and e2 of Figure 2.7) is the unique translation-invariant
ergodic Gibbs measure on rhombi tilings of the plane such that œÅ1 , œÅ2 and 1 ‚àí œÅ1 ‚àí œÅ2
are respectively the densities of the North-East, North-West and North rhombi under œÄœÅ
(here Gibbs means that the measure is locally uniform given the tiling outside a nite
domain). The measure œÄœÅ is reversible for the symmetric dynamic (p = q ) and irreversible
for the asymmetric dynamics (p = q ). As for Gates-Westcott stationary distributions, œÄœÅ
has a determinental structure whose kernel is given by the inverse of the Kasteleyn matrix
and the rhombus-rhombus correlations decay like the inverse of the distance squared (we
refer to [Ken09, KOS06] for an introduction on the topic). Using this nice structure,
the slope-dependent average speed of growth was computed in [Ton17, CF17]: for any
œÅ = (œÅ1 , œÅ2 ) such that 0 < œÅ1 , œÅ2 and œÅ1 + œÅ2 < 1, in the totally asymmetric case (p = 1
and q = 0),
                                              1 sin(œÄœÅ1 ) sin(œÄœÅ2 )
                              v(œÅ1 , œÅ2 ) = ‚àí                       ,                 (2.3.4)
                                              œÄ sin(œÄ(œÅ1 + œÅ2 ))
(there is a factor (q ‚àí p) instead of ‚àí1 in the general case). Moreover, the author
showed that the temporal height variance at stationarity grows at most logarithmically,
as predicted by Wolf's conjecture. As a remark, similar results were obtained in [Ton17,
CFT19] for a analogue dynamic with domino (instead of rhombus) tilings.
    Finally, let us mention that in the case of the specic initial condition studied in
[BF14], the authors showed that, in a large space-time subset, the rhombi correlation
          ‚àö determinental and were able to obtain a law of large number and even a CLT
function is
on scale log t, thus supporting strongly Wolf's conjecture. However, their approach
covers neither general initial height functions nor stationary proles. In that respect,
Legras and Toninelli treated the case of initial height functions approaching a general
smooth prole in [LT18] for which they showed a partial hydrodynamic limit (restricted
either to the rst time where shocks appear or to convex proles). As we will explain in
Chapter 3, completing this hydrodynamic limit is one of the main result of this thesis.


Chapter 3
Results of the thesis
The goal of this chapter is to state the main results shown in this thesis (a summary
of which can be found in Section 1.3). For each result (corresponding to the rst three
sections), we explain how it completes or improves previous works in the domain and
give the main ideas of the proof while emphasising the novelties w.r.t previous methods.
Finally, in the last section, we will also give some perspectives for future works.

3.1 Hydrodynamic limits for the Gates-Westcott and Borodin-
    Ferrari models
By far, the main result of the present work is the hydrodynamic limit of the two models in
the AKPZ class introduced in Chapter 2 i.e the Gates-Westcott model and the Borodin-
Ferrari dynamic whose proofs are written respectively in Chapters 4 and 5 (and in [Ler20,
LT20]). These results are all the more interesting as they are among the rst instances of
hydrodynamic limits in dimension (2 + 1) with (explicit) non-convex Hamiltonian which,
furthermore, are valid at all times and for all continuous initial proles for which the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation makes sense.
    In what follows, we will start by stating the two new theorems before giving some
context, explaining the progress obtained with respect to previous results in the literature
and introducing the new ideas employed to prove them.
3.1.1    Statement of the two new theorems
For both models, we start by introducing some notations completing those already in-
troduced in Chapter 2 in order to write the theorems accurately.
Hydrodynamic limit for the Gates-Westcott model
Let ŒìGW denote the state space of admissible discrete height functions for the Gates-
Westcott models i.e the set of functions œï : R √ó Z ‚Üí Z such that x ‚Üí œï(x, y) is
piece-wise constant with locally nite ¬±1 jumps (and upper semi-continuous) and such
                                            35

that œï satises the slope constraint (2.3.1) along the y coordinates as explained at the
beginning of Section 2.3.1.
   For any initial height prole œï ‚àà ŒìGW and any realisation œâ of the Poisson Point
Process of intensity 2 on R √ó Z √ó R+ , let us note

the Gates-Westcott dynamic with initial height prole œï and with creation locations
given by œâ .
     Then, let us dene the associated continuous state space of proles:

If f is dierentiable, this means that its gradient belong to R √ó [‚àí1, 0] (which is the
continuous analogue of (2.3.1)). As we will show in Proposition 4.4.10, ŒìÃÑGW is the
subset of continuous height functions that can be approached by a sequence of rescaled
height proles in ŒìGW , in the sense of convergence written below in (3.1.2).
     We are now ready to state the main theorem about the Gates-Westcott model.

3.1. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMITS FOR THE GW AND BF MODELS                                         37

Hydrodynamic limit for the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic
Contrarily to the Gates-Westcott model, the speed function associated to the Borodin-
Ferrari dynamic dened in (2.3.4) has singular slopes at which it diverges. Consequently,
extra care must be taken to restrict the state space to height proles for which the
Hamilton-Jacobi in the hydrodynamic limit makes sense.
    Let us start by denoting ŒìBF the general state space of admissible discrete height
functions of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic i.e the set of height functions that can be
associated to a conguration of interlaced particle satisfying condition (2.3.3), as seen in
Section 2.3.2. As explained before, the height functions are dened on a lattice that can
be identied to Z2 by choosing the coordinates system induced by the vectors e1 , e2 (and
by xing an origin) as shown in Figure 2.7. Therefore, we will note œï(x) the height at
the point of coordinates x = (x1 , x2 ) in this coordinates system.
    For any initial height prole œï ‚àà ŒìBF and any realisation œâ of the Poisson Point
Process of intensity 1 on G √ó R+ (where G is the lattice isomorphic to Z2 on which
particles can lie), let us note
                                        hBF (x, t; œï, œâ)
the height function evaluated at space position x = (x1 , x2 ) ‚àà Z2 and at time t ‚â•
0 following the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic with initial height prole œï and with jump
locations given by œâ .
    In this setting, one can check that the set of admissible slopes œÅ is equal to the
following triangle: {(œÅ1 , œÅ2 ) ‚àà [0, 1]2 , œÅ1 + œÅ2 ‚â§ 1}. In fact, 1 ‚àí œÅ1 ‚àí œÅ2 corresponds to
the density of particles lying on a line. Since the speed function dened in (2.3.4) has
singularities for all slopes such that œÅ1 + œÅ2 = 1, we are going to reduce the state space
to height proles with slopes uniformly away from this singular set. In that respect, we
dene, for all integer M ‚àà N, the subset ŒìBF     M ‚äÜ Œì
                                                        BF that can be associated to particle
congurations such that, on every line, the inter-particle distances are uniformly upper
bounded by M . This guarantees that the particle density on each line is uniformly lower
bounded by M ‚àí1 and thus that the slope œÅ1 +œÅ2 is uniformly upper bounded by 1‚àíM ‚àí1 .
    Now, we dene the associated continuous state space ŒìÃÑBF   M consisting in all continuous
                2
functions f : R ‚Üí R that are non-decreasing in both coordinates and such that

                                          f (x + Œª(1, 1)) ‚àí f (x)     1
                ‚àÄx ‚àà R2 ,   ‚àÄŒª > 0,                               ‚â§1‚àí   .             (3.1.6)
                                                    Œª                 M
If f is dierentiable, this means that its gradients belong to the triangle TM dened by

                         TM := {œÅ ‚àà [0, 1]2 , œÅ1 + œÅ2 ‚â§ 1 ‚àí M ‚àí1 }.                   (3.1.7)

As we will see later in Chapter 5, any function in ŒìÃÑBF
                                                     M can be approximated by a sequence
of rescaled height functions in ŒìBF
                                  M  in  the sense of convergence as in (3.1.8). Moreover,
restricted to TM , the speed function dened in (2.3.4) is well-dened and Lipschitz con-
tinuous. This will be enough to dene a proper hydrodynamic limit, as formulated in
the next theorem.

Remark 3.1.3. As remarked before, the function v is not well-dened on R2 so the meaning
of the PDE (3.1.10) deserves some explanations. In fact, it is implicitly assumed that u is
the unique viscosity solution of the PDE where v is replaced by any Lipschitz extension
vÃÉ of v to the whole R2 that coincides with v on TM . Since, in this case, the Hamiltonian
is Lipschitz, the standard theory of viscosity solutions (see Section 3.1.3) implies that
the solution u exists and is unique. Moreover, this solution doesn't depend on the way
v is extended outside TM . Indeed, an easy corollary of the comparison principle (see
Proposition 3.1.7) shows that if f ‚àà ŒìÃÑBF     M , then, whatever the choice of the Lipschitz
extension vÃÉ , the solution u(¬∑, t) stays in ŒìÃÑBF
                                               M at all times (informally ‚àáu ‚àà TM ) and thus
only the denition of vÃÉ inside TM matters to characterise the viscosity solution.
Remark    3.1.4. The requirement that f ‚àà ŒìÃÑBF M for some integer M is not a qualitative
condition but a technical condition that ensures that the slopes remain uniformly away
from the the set œÅ1 + œÅ2 = 1 where the speed v is ill-dened. This restriction is in a sense
optimal: in fact, if f is for instance the ane function of slope œÅ with {œÅ1 + œÅ2 = 1}
and œïL approaches f as in (3.1.8), then the limit height prole will be either +‚àû for
all positive times (if œÅ1 ‚àà (0, 1)) or the limit is not necessarily unique (if œÅ1 ‚àà {0, 1}),
i.e. it may depend on the way f is approached by œïL . Besides, the restriction to
discrete height proles in œïL ‚àà ŒìBF  M for some integer M helps to get a (weak) "nite
speed of propagation" property (see Proposition 5.3.3); this condition could be somewhat
weakened.


3.1. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMITS FOR THE GW AND BF MODELS                                       39

3.1.2   Context, new ideas and sketch of proof
Context and novelties with respect to previous results in the literature
The theorems 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 are among the rst hydrodynamic results for growth models
in dimension (d + 1) with d ‚â• 2 and with non-convex (though explicit) Hamiltonians.
Let us recall that the lack of convexity makes this kind of derivation dicult since a
variational formula is missing both for the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE and for the microscopic
model as opposed to the models introduced in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. Also, our theorems
hold for all times and for all initial proles for which the limit equation makes sense. In
this sense, Theorem 3.1.2 completes that of Legras and Toninelli in [LT18] who obtained
a hydrodynamic limit either up to the rst time of shocks (when the gradient of the
classical solution becomes discontinuous) or when the initial prole is convex (in which
case, the solution can also be expressed by a variational formula).
    The approach used here was introduced by Rezakhanlou in [Rez01] to study a family
of growth models with bounded height gradients. It relies on a characterisation of the
semi-group associated to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation by a list of conditions (reminded
e.g in Proposition 4.3.5) which are also satised at the microscopic level. The diculty
of his method comes from showing that the sequence of random semi-groups associated
to the rescaled dynamic is tight (in order to apply Prokhorov theorem) and to show
that any limit in distribution satises these conditions. Even if his method is potentially
quite robust, the only examples for which Rezakhanlou could obtain a full hydrodynamic
limit were one-dimensional. In higher dimensions, due to a lack of knowledge about
the structure of invariant measures of the models he considered, only a partial result
was obtained: any limit in distribution of the sequence of rescaled height functions is
concentrated on a set of viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations with a possibly
random Hamiltonian.
    Inspired by Rezakhanlou's method, Xufan Zhang obtained in [Zha18] the rst com-
plete hydrodynamic result for a growth model in the AKPZ class related to the so-called
domino shuing algorithm whose stationary distributions are given by weighted dimer
congurations on Z2 .
    With respect to [Rez01, Zha18], we had to overcome additional diculties related
to the unboundedness of the gradients for the Gates-Westcott model which requires a
non-trivial a priori bound on the spatial height dierences and to the unboundedness of
particle jumps for the Borodin-Ferrari model which prevents from using a nite speed
of propagation property, uniform in the initial prole, as required by Rezakhanlou's
technique. Because of the latter obstacle, Legras and Toninelli used a dierent approach
based on comparing directly the evolution of the rescaled height prole with the classical
solution of the PDE which can be approximated locally by ane stationary proles
(with slopes staying uniformly away from the line {œÅ1 + œÅ2 = 1}), as long as it stays
dierentiable. The main trick that we found to overcome this diculty is a new locality
result that we will mention the next subsection.
    Besides, we adapted the method of [Rez01, Zha18] so that the proof of compactness
is somehow simpler in the sense that, instead of replacing the discrete height function by


40                                               CHAPTER 3. RESULTS OF THE THESIS
a continuous interpolation in order to apply Prokhorov's theorem to the sequence of mi-
croscopic semi-groups, we use a more elementary approach of compactness adapted from
Azrel√†-Ascoli's theorem that we apply directly to the rescaled sequence of (discontinuous)
height functions.
    In addition, our method allows an improvement with respect to usual results as
in [Rez01, Zha18, LT18]. The hydrodynamic limits obtained in Theorems 3.1.1 and 3.1.2
hold in a stronger sense: that of almost sure convergence with respect to the underlying
Poisson Point Process (instead of convergence in probability).
    Before explaining the strategy of our proof, let us mention the work [BGRS19] of
Bahadoran, Guiol, Ravishankar and Saada who showed hydrodynamic limits for a class
of one-dimensional asymmetric interacting particle systems including the misanthrope
process (and that can be mapped to height processes without envelope property). They
used a constructive approach introduced in [BGRS02] based on showing rst the hydro-
dynamic limit for any stepped initial condition (called Riemann initial condition) and
then extending it to general initial conditions thanks to an approximation scheme (in-
spired by Glimm's scheme for conservation laws) using microscopic properties such as a
nite speed of propagation and attractiveness (in a spirit similar to the work [LT18] of
Legras and Toninelli). Their results hold for all time, either in a probability or almost
sure sense, without requiring explicit invariant measures and either in a homogeneous or
quenched random environnement, which constitute interesting improvements compared
to our result, although in the one-dimensional case.

Sketch of proof and key steps
Let us describe briey the main steps in the proof of Theorems 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 which is
inspired from Rezakhanlou's approach but presents some dierences namely in the proof
of compactness.

     1.   Construction of a sequence of random discrete semi-groups    SL (s, t; f, œâ) that cor-
          respond to the rescaled (by a ballistic scaling factor L) height function following
          the dynamic started close from the continuous initial prole f and with Poissonian
          points œâ restricted between the macroscopic times s and t (with s ‚â§ t).

     2.   Compactness : we show that for almost all realisation œâ of the PPP, the sequence
          of semi-groups (SL (¬∑, ¬∑; ¬∑, œâ))L‚ààN is contained in a (possibly random) compact set
          in the sense that for any subsequence (Lk )k‚ààN , we can extract a subsubsequence
          (Lkl )l‚ààN such that for any admissible continuous prole f , the sequence of functions
          (x, s, t) ‚Üí SLkl (s, t; f, œâ)(x) converges uniformly on all compact sets to a certain
          function S‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, œâ)(¬∑) that is continuous in space and time. The proof relies on
          an adaptation of Arzel√†-Ascoli's Theorem (see e.g Appendix 4.D).

     3.   Identication of the limit  : we show that, with probability one w.r.t the PPP,
          any such continuous limit S‚àû (., .; ., œâ) inherits the following properties: invariance
          under vertical translations, monotonicity (i.e attractiveness), locality, semi-group
          property and compatibility with linear solutions (precise statements can be found in


3.1. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMITS FOR THE GW AND BF MODELS                                       41

     Proposition 4.3.5). This characterises the limit as the unique semi-group associated
     to the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE and thus the sequence of rescaled height functions
     indeed converges almost surely to the unique viscosity solution.

    In the Gates-Westcott case, a key step to show compactness is the control of the
spatial gradients of the rescaled height functions w.r.t to the rst variable (w.r.t the
second variable, the height functions are 1-Lipschitz, by denition) and of the temporal
speed of growth which are a priori unbounded. For this, we used a comparison with the
one-dimensional Polynuclear Growth model and its variational formula (2.1.13) with œâ
replaced by a (non trivial) random subset together with standard estimates related to
Ulam's problem (introduced at the end of Section 2.1.4).
    As far as the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic is concerned, compactness could be shown by
means of a locality (or nite speed of propagation) property already shown in [LT18]
(which is weak in the sense that the speed of propagation is not uniform w.r.t the initial
height prole) and the assumption made on the maximal initial distance between parti-
cles. However, due to a lack of control on the inter-particle distances at positive times
t > 0, the latter locality property is not enough to identify the limit. Instead, we found
a new statement of locality (Proposition 5.3.5) whose intuition comes from a bijection
between the Borodin-Ferrari dynamics and the Gates-Westcott model (see Section 3.3)
for which a uniform locality property holds.
    In both cases, a necessary condition in the identication step 3 above was to show a
hydrodynamic limit for linear initial proles (and in an almost sure sense of convergence).
To achieve this goal, we relied on previous works about stationary measures [PS97,Pr√§03,
Ton17, CFT19] and, in particular, on a control of the variance of the spatio-temporal
height dierences. Such control was missing for the Gates-Westcott model and comes as
one of our side result presented in Section 3.2.

3.1.3   Viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations
In this section, we give an intrinsic denition of viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi
PDE and remind standard properties about them, namely that there is existence and
uniqueness in the case of a Lipschitz Hamiltonian. We refer to [Eva10, Bar13] for nice
introductions on the topic.
    As explained in the introduction (Section 1.2.3), the following Hamilton-Jacobi PDE
                           
                                ‚àÇt u = v(‚àáu) in Rd √ó (0, +‚àû)
                                                                                  (3.1.12)
                             u(¬∑, 0) = f      at t = 0,
doesn't always admit solutions in the classical sense and if it does, its gradient often
develops singularities (shocks) in nite time. The notion of viscosity solution introduced
by Evans [Eva10] and by Crandall and Lions [CL83] gives a meaning to the solution at
all time and, under some assumptions, guarantees uniqueness and existence. As often
when dealing with weak solutions, the idea is to transfer the regularity of the solution to
a family of smooth test functions that satisfy (3.1.12) in the following sense.


42                                               CHAPTER 3. RESULTS OF THE THESIS
Denition 3.1.5 (Viscosity solution). A continuous function u : Rd √ó R+ ‚Üí R is a
subsolution     (respectively a supersolution ) of (3.1.12) if for all œÜ ‚àà C ‚àû (Rd √ó (0, +‚àû))
and all (x0 , t0 ) ‚àà Rd √ó (0, +‚àû) such that u ‚àí œÜ has local maximum (resp. minimum) at
(x0 , t0 ), then the following inequality holds:

                                     ‚àÇt œÜ(x0 , t0 ) ‚â§ v(‚àáœÜ(x0 , t0 ))
                                                                                            (3.1.13)
                             (resp. ‚àÇt œÜ(x0 , t0 ) ‚â• v(‚àáœÜ(x0 , t0 )) ).

Finally, we say that u : Rd √ó R+ ‚Üí R is a viscosity solution of (3.1.12) if u is continuous,
u(x, 0) = f (x) for all x ‚àà Rd and u is both a subsolution and a supersolution.

     It is very easy to see that any smooth solution in the classical sense is also a viscosity
solution. Conversely, any viscosity solution satises the PDE (3.1.12) at all points where
it is dierentiable.
Remark   3.1.6. This denition comes from the vanishing viscosity method in which a
small regularising term Œµ Œîu is added to the r.h.s of the PDE (3.1.12) (in this case, the
solution exists in a classical sense and satises a maximum principle). The limit obtained
after sending Œµ to 0 is a viscosity solution in the sense of Denition 3.1.5.
    Now, we introduce some classical properties of viscosity solutions that are used along
this work. It is enough for our purposes to consider the case of a Lipschitz Hamiltonian. In
this case, one can show a strong nite speed of propagation property (see [Bar13, Section
5.3]) that implies, in particular the so-called comparison principle that we express as
follows:

Proposition 3.1.7     (Finite speed of propagation and Comparison principle) Let u1 and .
u2 be viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation ‚àÇt u = v(‚àáu) on Rd √ó (0, +‚àû)
with v a Lipchitz function on Rd . Then, there exists some constant C > 0 such that for
any R ‚â• 0 and t ‚â• 0,


     (u1 (¬∑, 0) ‚â§ u2 (¬∑, 0) in B(0, R)) =‚áí (u1 (¬∑, t) ‚â§ u2 (¬∑, t) in B(0, R ‚àí C t)) .       (3.1.14)

In particular, we have the following comparison principle: for any           t ‚â• 0,

                           u1 (¬∑, 0) ‚â§ u2 (¬∑, 0) =‚áí u1 (¬∑, t) ‚â§ u2 (¬∑, t).                  (3.1.15)

    This yields uniqueness of the viscosity solution to equation (3.1.12). With respect
to existence, Perron's method (and the nite speed of propagation property) can be
used to show that viscosity solutions of (3.1.12) do exist (we refer the interested reader
to [Bar13, Section 7]). Consequently, the following proposition holds.

Proposition 3.1.8 (Existence and Uniqueness). When v is a Lipschitz function on Rd,
the Hamilton-Jacobi equation     (3.1.12) admits a unique viscosity solution.


3.2. LOG BOUND FOR THE STATIONARY GROWTH OF THE GW MODEL                                43

3.2 Logarithmic upper bound on the variance of the tem-
    poral growth for the stationary Gates-Westcott model
As explained in the previous section, an upper bound on the variance of the height
dierence: h(0, t) ‚àí h(0, 0) for large t for the stationary Gates-Westcott model was a
necessary step to prove the hydrodynamic limit for linear initial proles. In that respect,
we showed that the variance of h(0, t) ‚àí h(0, 0) is bounded by O(log t), as t goes to
innity. This upper bound supports Wolf's conjecture on the asymptotic behaviour of
growth models in the AKPZ universality class.
   The result we obtained in Lemma 4.6.4 can be reformulated more easily as follows:
Theorem 3.2.1. For any slope parameter œÅ ‚àà R √ó (‚àí1, 0),
                                                     
                   VarœÄœÅ hGW (0, 0, t) ‚àí hGW (0, 0, 0) = O (log t) ,                (3.2.1)
                                                           t‚Üí‚àû

where the variance VarœÄœÅ is with respect to the law of the stationary process with initial
distribution sampled from the stationary measure œÄœÅ (whose construction will be reminded
in Section 4.3.3).
    Notice that, because of the spatial translation invariance of the stationary measures,
the same result holds at any other xed space position (x, y) ‚àà R √ó Z.
    In the literature, analogous upper bounds were obtained in [Ton17,CFT19] for dimer
dynamics on Z2 or on the Hexagonal lattice (which covers the case of the Borodin-
Ferrari dynamic). More recently, in [CET20], the authors showed a similar logarithmic
upper bound for the stationary solution of the mollied AKPZ equation (1.2.10) with
a diagonal matrix H with entries +1 and ‚àí1. In the same spirit, let us also mention
the interesting works [CT19a, CT19b] of Chhita and Toninelli who studied the domino
shuing algorithm with periodic weights and showed the existence of slopes at which the
speed function v is not dierentiable and the r.h.s of (3.2.1) is O(1) instead of O(log t)
(Wolf's conjecture says nothing for slopes at which the Hessian of v is ill-dened).

Sketch of proof
The method to obtain this kind of result was introduced by Toninelli in [Ton17] and
seems to be very general. The main ingredients are an estimate on the kink/antikink
(or dimer-dimer) decorrelation, a logarithmic upper bound for the spatial variance of the
stationary height dierences (which is typical for models in the AKPZ class according to
Wolf's conjecture) and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Such inequality can only yield an
upper bound and, so far, no general lower bound has been found for the variance of the
stationary growth of multi-dimensional models (the only example for which such bound
exists is the integrable initial condition considered by Borodin and Ferrari in [BF14]).
    In the proof of Theorem 3.2.1, the idea is to look at the height integrated on a large
square domain Œõ of R √ó Z (or Z2 in the case of the dimer model):

kink/antikink correlations decay like the inverse of the distance squared (an upper bound
is enough for our purposes). Notice that a similar behaviour holds for the dimer-dimer
correlations.
    The nal step consists in comparing hŒõ (t) ‚àí hŒõ (0) with |Œõ|(h(0, 0, t) ‚àí h(0, 0, 0)).
Thanks to the logarithmic bound on the variance of the spatial height dierences (which

3.3 A new bijection between the Gates-Westcott model and
    a continuous limit of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic
The last result in this thesis is a new bijection between the Gates-Westcott model and
a continuous version of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic. This correspondence comes from
a graphical construction of the Gates-Westcott model with a boundary condition on a
generalised space-time domain (instead of the usual intial condition at t = 0): when the
boundary conditions is chosen on a specic set of the form {(x, y, t), t = a x} with a ‚àà
[‚àí1, 1], we recover either the standard Gates-Westcott model for a = 0, a continuous limit

     Similarly to the condition (2.3.3) for the density of particles at ‚àí‚àû for the BF
dynamic, the last condition in the previous denition is a control on the density of kinks
and antikinks at ¬±‚àû which is necessary to obtain a well-dened dynamic. Such condition
is not required if limx‚Üí¬±‚àû Œ≥(x) + |x|= +‚àû. Keep in mind that the case Œ≥(x) = x (which
falls in case 3) will correspond to a continuous limit of the BF dynamic.
     In contrast with the Polynuclear Growth model, there is no simple variational formula
analogue to (3.3.1) to extend easily the denition of the Gates-Westcott model. Instead,
we dened an iterative procedure that, given a boundary condition hŒ≥ ‚àà ŒìŒ≥ and given a
Poisson Point Process œâ on R √ó Z √ó R, associates a height function dened for all y ‚àà Z
and t ‚â• Œ≥(x):
                                     hGW (x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ),                         (3.3.5)
that has to be though of as the height function evolving according to the Gates-Westcott
model with boundary condition hŒ≥ on the set t = Œ≥(x). The idea is to decide iteratively
for all point in œâ (in a consistent order) whether it leads to an "accepted" creation (i.e a
height increase at the given Poisson point) or not by checking condition (2.3.1). In the
end, one recovers a variational formula similar to (3.3.1) with œâ replaced by the subset
œâÃÉ of accepted creations (the details of the procedure can be found in Section 6.2.1).
    As a sanity check, we showed that if Œ≥ ‚â° 0, then this construction produces a height
function that is consistent with the Gates-Westcott model with usual initial condition at
t = 0.

A continuous version of the BF dynamic
Let us explain briey what the continuous version of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic is. The
dierence with the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic dened in Chapter 2 is that the particles lie
and jump on a lattice R √ó Z instead of Z √ó Z. As in the discrete setting, the particles
are interlaced in the sense that, between any two neighbouring particles on a line y ,
there exists a unique particle on line y + 1 whose position is between those of the two
neighbouring particles. Particles attempt to jumps leftwards according to a Poisson Point
Process on R √ó Z √ó R+ of intensity 1: at any Poisson point (x, y, t), the leftmost particle
on line y to the right of x jumps to x at time t if the conguration remains interlaced after
the jump and otherwise nothing happens (see Section 6.2.3 for a more precise denition
of the model). Moreover, the same condition on the density of particles at ‚àí‚àû as in
(2.3.3) must be satised so that the dynamic is well dened.
    In order to make the bijection more explicit, we specify (in Denition 6.2.14) a map-
ping between such interlaced particles conguration and height functions which is one-to-
one (modulo xing the height at the origin) . The gradient hBF (x , y)‚àíhBF (x, y) is dened

as the number of particles on line y in [x, x ] (for x < x ) and hBF (x, y + 1) ‚àí hBF (x, y) is
equal to ‚àí1 if the unique particle on line y + 1 which lies between the two neighbouring
particles on line y surrounding x stands to the right of x and is equal to 0 if it stands
to the left of x. Moreover, between times t and t , the height at (x, y) decreases by the
number of particles on line y crossing position x in the time interval [t, t ]. Let us note
ŒìBF the set of such admissible height functions (with some abuse, we take the same nota-
tion as for the discrete case). Notice that, by analogy with (2.3.3), such height functions
satisfy limx‚Üí‚àí‚àû |x|‚àí1/2 hBF (x, y) = ‚àí‚àû.
    We note hBF (x, y, t; h0 , œâ) the height function associated to the continuous version
of the BF dynamic started from initial conguration h0 ‚àà ŒìBF and with particle jumps
given by a PPP realisation œâ .

The bijection
We are know ready to state the following Theorem:

Theorem 3.3.2. Fix any boundary condition hŒ≥ on the set {(x, y, t) ‚àà R √ó Z √ó R), t =
                                                        œÄ/4
x}  that satises the conditions of Denition 3.3.1 with Œ≥œÄ/4 (x) = x. For almost all
realisation œâ of a Poisson point process of intensity 2 on R √ó Z √ó R, for all t ‚â• x and all
y ‚àà Z,
                     hGW (x, y, t; hŒ≥œÄ/4 , œâ) = hBF (x + t, y, t ‚àí x, h0 , œâ  ),        (3.3.6)

with h0 := (x, y, 0) ‚Üí hŒ≥œÄ/4 (x/2, y, x/2) ‚àà ŒìBF and œâ = {(x + t, y, t ‚àí x), (x, y, t) ‚àà œâ},
the images of hŒ≥œÄ/4 and œâ under the change of coordinates (x, t) ‚Üí (x + t, t ‚àí x).
    Analogously to Figure 3.1 in dimension one, the bijection can also be seen as follows:
the interlaced space-time trajectories of the particles for the continuous BF dynamic
correspond (under space-time rotation of coordinates (x, t)) to the level lines of the
height functions (x, t) ‚Üí hGW (x, y, t) that are interlaced for successive values of y as
showed in Figure 3.3.
    As we will explain at the end of Section 6.2.3, Theorem 3.3.2 implies that the GW
model started from a droplet initial conguration is equivalent to the continuous space
limit of the triangular initial condition considered by BF in [BF14].
Remark     3.3.3. Similarly, the Gates-Westcott model with boundary condition on the set
{(x, y, t), t = tan(Œ±)x with Œ± ‚àà (‚àíœÄ/4, œÄ/4)} is in bijection, under rotation of angle
Œ± of the space-time coordinates (x, t), with the Gates-Westcott model with kinks and
antikinks moving at speed vk (Œ±) = tan(œÄ/4 + Œ±) and va (Œ±) = ‚àí tan(œÄ/4 ‚àí Œ±) (instead
of ¬±1).

Hydrodynamic limits with generalised boundary conditions and corollaries
Finally, we showed a hydrodynamic limit for the Gates-Westcott model with general
boundary condition, and as a consequence for the continuous limit of the Borodin-Ferrari
dynamic that can be expressed as follows.

Remark 3.3.5. If (H1) doesn't hold, uniqueness of the viscosity solution of (3.3.9) in the

stronger assumptions on the gradients of fŒ≥ as written in Corollary 6.3.5.
    As a consequence of Theorems 3.3.2 and 3.3.4 (and Remark 3.3.3), we obtain two
corollaries: the hydrodynamic limit for the continuous version of the Borodin-Ferrari
dynamic and for the Gates-Westcott model with asymmetric kink/antikink speeds. We
refer to Corollaries 6.3.5 and 6.3.3 for the precise statements.


3.4 Perspectives for future works
Before moving to the detailed proofs of our results, let us give a few words about ongoing
projects and possible extensions of our work:

     ¬à Convergence of the stationary measures of the Gates-Westcott model to the Gaus-
       sian Free Field. Pr√§hofer and Spohn showed in [PS97] that, under the invariant
       measures, the variance of the spatial height dierences grows like the logarithm
       of the distance between points. Actually, with extra work, thanks to the determi-
       nental structure of kink/antikink
                                n        correlations, we should be able to compute any
       moments of the from EœÄœÅ [ i=1 (h(xi , yi ) ‚àí h(xi , yi ))] and then show, by the method
       of moments, that the stationary height prole (seen as a random eld) converges
       to the massless Gaussian Free Field in dimension 2, as expected by Wolf's conjec-
       ture. The method to obtain such derivation in the context of measures on dimer
       congurations is explained e.g in [Ken09, LT15].

     ¬à Consequences of the bijection between the Gates-Westcott model and the Borodin-
       Ferrari dynamic. As we will argue at the end of Chapter 6, in Subsection 6.3.1,
       the result of Theorem 3.3.2 suggests that, modulo a continuous space limit, we
       can transfer the results of [BF14] to the‚àöGW model in a droplet initial setting
       and deduce, in particular a CLT on scale log t. Moreover, since the BF dynamic
       at stationarity enjoys determinental spatial height correlations (see e.g [Ken09,
       Ton17]), we expect from the bijection that the Gates-Westcott model has also

      determinental corelations (and converge to the GFF) along the planes {(x, y, t), t =
      x} and also t = ax with a ‚àà [‚àí1, 1]. However, this would not say anything about
      the non-trivial height correlations that we expect to see along the characteristic
      lines of the PDE (3.1.5).

  ¬à   Hydrodynamic limit for the non-totally asymmetric Borodin-Ferrari dynamic.      Al-
      though the method of Rezakhanlou has already been employed to show hydrody-
      namic limits for partially asymmetric growth models in dimension 1 (see [Rez01]),
      as far as we know, there is no such result in higher dimensions and in a non-totally
      asymmetric setting. Therefore, it would be very interesting to show a hydrody-
      namic limit for the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic where particles can perform jumps in
      both directions as in [Ton17]. Even if most properties true for the totally asym-
      metric can be easily adapted, the main obstacle comes once again from controlling
      the speed of propagation of information (that can now travel both leftwards and
      rightwards). In particular, the (weak) locality property shown in [LT18] and the
      new locality statement that we used to show Theorem 3.1.2 now fail and it seems
      non-trivial to adapt them to the partially asymmetric setting.

Hydrodynamic Limit for the
Gates-Westcott model
In this Chapter, we study a model, introduced initially by Gates and Westcott [GW95]
to describe crystal growth evolution, which belongs to the Anisotropic KPZ universality
class [PS97]. It can be thought of as a   (2+1)-dimensional generalisation of the well known
(1+1)-dimensional Polynuclear Growth Model (PNG). We show the full hydrodynamic
limit of this process i.e the convergence of the random interface height prole after
ballistic space-time scaling to the viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi PDE:       ‚àÇt u =
v(‚àáu) with v   an explicit non-convex speed function. The convergence holds in the strong
almost sure sense.
   The content of this Chapter is has been taken from the article [Ler20].         For this
reason, the notations adopted here may dier slightly from those of Chapter 3.



4.1 Introduction
Crystal growth belongs to a wider class of random interface growth phenomena that
appear naturally in physics and biology [BS95].        Trying to better understand the be-
havior of these natural phenomena is a source of interest in itself. On the other hand,
random growth models mainly caught the attention of mathematicians in the last cou-
ple of decades because of their conjectural universality properties and relation with the
KPZ (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) equation [KPZ86] which presumably encodes their long-time
uctuation behavior (see e.g [Cor12, FS10, Qua11] for reviews on the topic in dimension
(1 + 1)   and [Ton18] in dimension   (2 + 1)).
   To x ideas, the microscopic   d-dimensional interface is typically modelled by the graph
of a discrete height function   h : Zd √ó R+ ‚Üí Z (here, R+ represents the time variable)
and evolves according to an asymmetric Markovian dynamic which is often related to
interacting particles systems. The transition rates are assumed to depend only on height
gradients, so that the dynamics is invariant by vertical translations of the interface. The
rst problem one may address is the law of large numbers or      hydrodynamic limit,   i.e the
typical macroscopic behavior of the randomly evolving height function. Under space-time

ballistic rescaling of the form n‚àí1 h( nx, nt), the height prole is expected to converge
to the solution of a rst-order non-linear PDE of Hamilton-Jacobi type:

                                      ‚àÇt u = v(‚àáu),                                (4.1.1)

where the growth velocity v only depends on the slope and not on u itself since the
model is vertically translation invariant. Next, and more challengingly, comes the study
of uctuations, i.e the behavior of the discrete height function around its hydrodynamic
limit. The large-scale uctuations are expected to look qualitatively like the solution of
the KPZ equation and in particular share the same universal characteristics exponents.
Most results in this direction are established for d = 1. In dimension two, growth
models are conjectured [Wol91] to fall into two universality classes depending on the
convexity properties of v . When v is strictly convex (or concave), we speak simply of
KPZ universality class: it is predicted and numerically observed that uctuations grow
like tŒ≤ with a universal exponent Œ≤ > 0 and spatial uctuations at equilibrium grow
with a roughness exponent Œ± = 2Œ≤/(Œ≤ + 1). When the Hessian of v has signature
(+, ‚àí) the model is conjectured to belong to the so-called Anisotropic KPZ (AKPZ)
class where spatial and temporal uctuations are expected to grow logarithmically and
spatial uctuations to scale to a Gaussian Free Field, as is the case for the stochastic
heat equation with additive noise. One says that the non-linearity in the KPZ equation
is irrelevant in the AKPZ regime and relevant in the KPZ one.
     The model we are considering in this paper was introduced by Gates and Westcott
in [GW95] to describe crystal growth evolution and its stationary states. The interface
can be described by a height function h : (R √ó Z) √ó R+ ‚Üí Z, semi-discrete in space
and continuous in time, whose level lines are piece-wise constant functions with ¬±1
jumps. Even if we adopt a dierent viewpoint, the Gates-Westcott dynamic can be
viewed as a multi-line generalisation of the PNG dynamic where each level line follows
simultaneously the PNG dynamic with kink/antikink creations suppressed whenever
two lines intersect. Although the PNG is a solvable model that can be mapped to
the problem of the longest increasing subsequence of a random permutation, to random
polymers and to random matrix ensembles (see [FP06] for a nice review on the topic), the
Gates-Westcott dynamics induces non-trivial interaction among level lines, which makes
the model harder to analyse. In [PS97], Pr√§hofer and Spohn identied a slope-dependent
family of stationary distributions for the dynamic restricted to a bi-dimensional torus
(note that Gates and Westcott already computed equilibrium measures in [GW95] but
only for a one-dimensional subset of slopes œÅ). In a certain thermodynamic limit of
large torus, they were able to compute the slope-dependent growth velocity v(œÅ) at
stationarity. This is the natural candidate for the speed function v(œÅ) in (4.1.1). As
expected, the Hessian of v has signature (+, ‚àí) everywhere so the model belongs to the
AKPZ universality class. The authors of [PS97] also showed that the spatial uctuations
at equilibrium are of logarithmic order with respect to the distance between points;
this is typical of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field. However, they didn't treat
the temporal uctuations (also expected to grow logarithmically). Our contribution to
the study of the model is the rigorous proof of the hydrodynamic limit starting from


4.1. INTRODUCTION                                                                        55

arbitrary initial condition. As an intermediate step, we also get a logarithmic upper
bound on uctuation growth w.r.t. time in the stationary states (see Lemma 4.6.4).
    In the literature, most results about hydrodynamic limits in multi-dimensional spaces
are given for convex velocities v , where the viscosity solution of (4.1.1) can be expressed
in terms of the variational Hopf-Lax formula. The strategy is to show that the discrete
height function enjoys a variational formula (sometimes called "envelope property") at
the microscopic level, which passes to the limit thanks to the sub-additive ergodic theo-
rem. This applies e.g to the Corner Growth Model [Sep08, Section 9], Ballistic deposi-
tion [Sep00] and a wider family of grows models on Zd [Rez02], and yields existence of
such a hydrodynamic limit without providing an explicit expression of the speed func-
tion v . The function v can be explicitly identied when equilibrium measures are known,
as is the case for various one-dimensional models, such as ASEP and PNG. For two-
dimensional models in the AKPZ class, such envelope property and Hopf-Lax formula
cannot hold, otherwise the speed function in the hydrodynamic limit would automatically
result to be convex.
    In his seminal article [Rez01], Rezakhanlou introduced a dierent approach to hy-
drodynamic limit for growth processes based on a compactness argument and on a list
of conditions that allow to identify any limit point with the unique viscosity solution of
(4.1.1). This method does not require convexity of v , but the only examples for which a
full hydrodynamic limit was proved in [Rez01] are one-dimensional where the structure
of ergodic translation invariant stationary measures is better understood. For d ‚â• 2,
only a partial result was obtained, namely, that any limit in distribution of the rescaled
height prole is concentrated on a set of viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations
with a possibly random speed function. However, a precise description of equilibrum
measures is available for some of these models (e.g the Gates-Westcott model [PS97] and
models related to the two-dimensional dimer model [BF14, CT16, Ton17, CT19a] where
the stationary measures are given by translation invariant Gibbs measures on perfect
matchings [KOS06]). Inspired by Rezakhanlou's technique, Zhang obtained the rst
full hydrodynamic limit [Zha18] for a (2 + 1)-dimensional growth model. Specically,
he considered the dimer shuing-algorithm, whose stationary distributions are given by
weighted random dimer congurations on Z2 . Let us also mention the works [BF14,LT18]
about a long jump two-dimensional interlaced particle dynamic generalising the Ham-
mersley process. In [BF14], the authors showed the hydrodynamic limit starting from a
very specic initial condition (with a CLT for temporal uctuations on scale log t) while
in [LT18], the authors proved the hydrodynamic limit either up to the rst time when a
shock appears, or under the assumption of a convex initial prole [Eva14].
    The present article follows the main idea of [Rez01,Zha18] in terms of proof structure.
The idea consists in constructing a sequence (labeled by the parameter n associated to the
ballistic rescaling) of discrete random semi-groups associated to the rescaled microscopic
dynamic, showing compactness in some sense and identifying the limiting continuous
semi-group with the one associated with the unique viscosity solution of the PDE. The
identication relies both on the sucient conditions given in [Rez01] (summarised in
Proposition 4.3.5) and on a precise analysis of the stationary processes. With respect


56                    CHAPTER 4. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE GW MODEL
to [Rez01, Zha18], non-trivial additional diculties we had to overcome in the proof of
compactness are related to the semi-continuous character of the model and to unbound-
edness of the slopes and of the speed function. In particular, we had to control the
evolution of spatial gradients (Proposition 4.5.6) while this was trivial in [Rez01, Zha18]
since gradients are bounded. To do so, we related the height function along the rst
coordinate to the PNG with a random subset of Poissonian creations and used a rep-
resentation in terms of random directed polymers. Also, instead of showing tightness
of probability measures like in [Rez01, Zha18], we showed that, for a certain topology,
the sequence of random semi-groups is almost surely contained in a (random) compact
set and then proved almost sure uniqueness of the possible sub-sequential limits. Let us
emphasize that the hydrodynamic limit we obtained is in the strong sense of almost sure
convergence (on an underlying probability space determined by the Poissonian clocks).
    The article is structured as follows. The Gates-Westcott model is introduced in
Section 2: we dene the state space of admissible height functions and its dynamic via a
Poisson Point Process on R √ó Z √ó R+ representing space-time locations of kink-antikink
creations. In section 3, we start by stating the main result: the hydrodynamic limit for
the height function (Theorem 4.3.1). Then, we remind elements of Hamilton-Jacobi PDE
theory and useful results on equilibrium measures. The rest of the article is dedicated to
the proof of the main theorem (the strategy of the proof is briey explained at the end of
Section 3). In Section 4, we rst show elementary facts about the microscopic dynamic
and a fundamental property of locality (Corollary 4.4.8) and then construct the sequence
of random discrete semi-group mentioned above. Section 5 is about proving compactness.
A key step in this proof is the control of random spatio-temporal gradients (Propositions
4.5.5 and 4.5.6). Then, we apply a Arzel√†-Ascoli type theorem (Proposition 4.D.1) and
show compactness of the sequence of discrete semi-groups. Finally, in Section 6, we
identify the limit points as the semi-group associated with the unique viscosity solution
of (4.3.5) thanks to Proposition 4.3.5 and the results about equilibrium measures.


4.2 The Gates-Westcott model
4.2.1     Height function
In this model, the surface will be described by a discrete height function   œï:R√óZ‚ÜíZ
which lives in the state space given as follows:

Denition 4.2.1. Let Œì be the set of functions h : R √ó Z ‚Üí Z satisfying the following
two conditions:

     1. For anyy ‚àà Z, x ‚Üí h(x, y) is piece-wise constant with a locally nite number of
       ¬±1-valued jumps. By convention, we impose that the values at discontinuity points
       make the function upper semi-continuous.

     2. For any   x ‚àà R, h(x, y + 1) ‚àí h(x, y) ‚àà {‚àí1, 0}.
Because of condition 1, the discontinuities along direction   x   can be of three dierent
types:


4.2. THE GATES-WESTCOTT MODEL                                                                     57

   ¬à kink : h(x, y) = h(x‚àí , y) = h(x+ , y) + 1

   ¬à antikink : h(x, y) = h(x‚àí , y) + 1 = h(x+ , y)

   ¬à kink-antikink pair : h(x, y) = h(x‚àí , y) + 1 = h(x+ , y) + 1.

    A height function looks like a stack of terraces seen from a plane (see Figure 4.1), the
edges of each terrace along the x direction corresponding to the kinks and antikinks of
the height function. Due to the rst condition in Denition 4.2.1, each function h(¬∑, y)
is entirely determined by the position of its kinks and antikinks and its height at any
point x0 ‚àà R. In other words, the kinks and antikinks dene the variations of the height
function along the x direction.
Remark 4.2.2. In the article [GW95] of Gates and Westcott, condition 2 was replaced
by the height function being integer-valued and non-decreasing along the y direction
so that arbitrary slopes could be allowed (which is physically more realistic). However,
there exists a one-to-one correspondence between height functions according to these two
denition variants, as explained in [Pr√§03, p.91].

4.2.2    Dynamic
Let œâ be a Poisson Point Process of intensity 2 on R √ó Z √ó R+ seen as a random,
locally nite, set of points in R √ó Z √ó R+ that will be called creations. Starting from a
conguration in the state space Œì, the Gates-Westcott dynamic is dened by three rules:
the rst two are deterministic while the last one is random.

   ¬à Lateral Expansion : each terrace expands laterally at speed 1, i.e. each kink (resp.
     antikink) of the height function is moved at speed +1 (resp ‚àí1) along the x direc-
     tion.

   ¬à Annihilation : whenever two terraces meet, they merge, i.e. whenever a kink and
     an antikink meet, they annihilate each other.

   ¬à Creation : If (x, y, t) ‚àà œâ , then the height h at (x, y) increases by one at time t if
     the height function obtained remains in Œì. In other words, a kink-antikink pair is
     created at time t and at space position (x, y) if the height function remains in Œì after
     the transition, i.e. if h(x, y ‚àí 1, t‚àí ) ‚àí h(x, y, t‚àí ) = 1, h(x, y, t‚àí ) ‚àí h(x, y + 1, t‚àí ) = 0
     and if there is no preexisting discontinuity of h(¬∑, y, t‚àí ) at x. Note that the last
     condition is veried with probability 1, since the discontinuities are locally nite
     hence countable for any function in Œì.

Remark 4.2.3. As usual in interacting particle systems, some care has to be taken to
ensure that the process is well dened on the innite lattice. If we worked in a nite
domain, there would be a nite number of creations in nite time intervals and we could
know the height function deterministically up to the rst time of creation, determine
whether this creation occurs or not and repeat the procedure inductively on the number
of creations. On the innite lattice it makes no sense to look at the rst creation but

measure induced by a Poisson Point Process of intensity 2 on R √ó Z √ó R+ . For all œâ ‚àà Œ©,

as the height function at time t obtained by applying the Gates-Westcott dynamic de-

sucient conditions to identify it. In Section 4.3.3, we will present useful results about

4.3.2    Viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations
In this section, we briey recall some elements of the theory of Hamilton-Jacobi Partial
Dierential Equations. In order to show Theorem 4.3.1, all we need to know about
viscosity solutions is gathered in Theorem 4.3.4 and in Proposition 4.3.5. The interested
reader can nd more background and motivations about Hamilton-Jacobi equations in
the monography [Eva10] for instance.
    Given f, v ‚àà C(Rd ), we consider the following rst order PDE:
                         
                               ‚àÇt u = v(‚àáu) on Rd √ó (0, +‚àû)
                                                                                   (4.3.7)
                            u(¬∑, 0) = f         on Rd .

Under some further regularity conditions on v and f , it is possible to apply the method
of characteristics to obtain a local classical solution. In general, whatever the regularity
of v and f , shocks for ‚àáu appear in nite time and the solution is no more dierentiable.
In order to give a denition of solution that is global in time, we introduce the classical
concept of viscosity solution that guarantees existence and uniqueness under suitable
assumptions.

Denition 4.3.3. We say that u : Rd √ó [0, T ] ‚Üí R is a viscosity solution of (4.3.7) on
Rd √ó [0, T ] if u is continuous, u(., 0) = f and u is both a subsolution and a supersolution.
    A function u is a subsolution (respectively a supersolution ) if for all œÜ ‚àà C ‚àû (Rd √ó
(0, T )) and all (x0 , t0 ) ‚àà Rd √ó (0, T ) such that œÜ(x0 , t0 ) = u(x0 , t0 ) and œÜ ‚â• u (resp.
œÜ ‚â§ u) on a neighbourhood of (x0 , t0 ), the following inequality holds:

                                   ‚àÇt œÜ(x0 , t0 ) ‚â§ v(‚àáœÜ(x0 , t0 ))
                                                                                       (4.3.8)
                            (resp. ‚àÇt œÜ(x0 , t0 ) ‚â• v(‚àáœÜ(x0 , t0 )) ).

    We won't address the question of general existence of viscosity solutions because,
in our case, we will show existence by proving that the hydrodynamic limit is indeed
a solution of (4.3.5). However, a result of uniqueness will be needed to identify the
potential limit points. The following Theorem shown by Ishii can be obtained as a
corollary of [Ish84, Th. 2.5].

Theorem 4.3.4.      If v is globally Lipschitz, there is at most one viscosity solution of
(4.3.7) on Rd √ó [0, T ].

    Since the function v in (4.3.6) is globally Lipschitz, there is at most one viscosity
solution of (4.3.5).
    The next proposition gives sucient conditions to identify the viscosity solution of
(4.3.5). Even if it is stated for the special case of functions living in the two-dimensional
continuous state-space ŒìÃÑ dened in (4.3.2) and for the speed function v dened in (4.3.6),
it can be easily extended to a more general framework.

Proposition 4.3.5. Let T be a positive real number and S(s, t, ¬∑)0‚â§s‚â§t‚â§T be a family of
functions from ŒìÃÑ into itself satisfying the following properties:

  5. Compatibility with linear solutions : for all linear function fœÅ : x ‚Üí œÅ ¬∑ x with

                                    S(s, t, fœÅ ) = fœÅ + v(œÅ)(t ‚àí s).

For any f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, if (x, t) ‚Üí S(0, t, f )(x) is continuous, then it is a viscosity solution of
(4.3.7).

   The proof of this proposition is postponed to appendix 4.A.

4.3.3    Equilibrium measures
In this section, we briey remind a few facts about equilibrium measures, following
Pr√§hofer and Spohn [PS97, Pr√§03]. They identied a family of random height functions,
whose spatial height dierences have a law that is translation-invariant with a slope
parameter œÅ in R √ó (‚àí1, 0), and are stationary with respect to time (Gates and Westcott
already treated the case œÅ ‚àà {0} √ó (‚àí1, 0) when they introduced their model in [GW95]).
Pr√§hofer and Spohn also computed the stationary growth speed v(œÅ) which gives the
candidate speed function of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (4.3.6) in Theorem 4.3.1 and
showed that the variance of spatial height dierences behaves logarithmically. To do
so, they used fermionic Fock space tools to carry out a ne analysis of the equilibrium
measures. Let us sum up useful results, most of which can be recovered or easily deduced
from [Pr√§03, Section 6] and others will be detailed in Appendix 4.B.
    The starting point of Pr√§hofer and Spohn [PS97, Pr√§03] is the analysis of the Gates-
Westcott model in a periodized setting, i.e. on a torus [‚àíM, M ) √ó ‚àíN, N ‚àí 1. Let us
remark that, even though we use dierent notations, we follow the construction of [Pr√§03]


62                 CHAPTER 4. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE GW MODEL
rather than [PS97] in which a more complicated "twisted" periodic boundary condition is
considered (both constructions lead to the same results in the innite volume limit of the
torus). The allowed height proles have space gradients that are periodic with horizontal
period 2N and vertical period 2M . They evolve according to the periodised Gates-
Westcott dynamic i.e the Gates-Wescott dynamic with periodised Poissonian creations
[œâ]M,N dened from œâ as follows:

                          (x, y, t) ‚àà [œâ]M,N ‚áî ([x]M , [y]N , t) ‚àà œâ,                     (4.3.9)

where [x]M is the unique number in [‚àíM, M ) equal to x modulo 2M and similarly
for [y]N . In [Pr√§03, Section 6.2], the author dened a family of random height functions
(see [Pr√§03, equation (6.9)]) taking values in Œì, whose law is indexed by weight parameters
Œ∑ ¬± on antikinks and on kinks and a slope parameter along y (related to the density of
level lines). The space gradients of these functions are 2M, 2N periodic and their law is
translation invariant and time stationary. Fixing properly the weights Œ∑ ¬± and the line
density, one can guarantee that the average slope approaches any xed œÅ in R √ó (‚àí1, 0)
when the size of the torus tends to innity (sending rst M and then N to innity). We
call then œïM,N,œÅ the stationary periodized prole with limit slope œÅ, so that

           ‚àÄ(x, y) ‚àà R √ó Z        lim    lim E [œïM,N,œÅ (x, y)] = œÅ ¬∑ (x, y)              (4.3.10)
                                 N ‚Üí‚àû M ‚Üí‚àû

(we are xing here œïM,N,œÅ (0, 0) = 0) and stationarity translates into
                                                                      law
  ‚àÄt ‚â• 0     h(¬∑, ¬∑, t; œïM,N,œÅ , [œâ]M,N ) ‚àí h(0, 0, t; œïM,N,œÅ , [œâ]M,N ) = œïM,N,œÅ (¬∑, ¬∑). (4.3.11)

    In [PS97, Pr√§03], the authors showed that the joint probability density of kinks,
antikinks and occupation variables (i.e the set of (x, y) such that œïM,N,œÅ (x, y + 1) ‚àí
œïM,N,œÅ (x, y) = ‚àí1) has a determinantal structure and identied the associated kernel.
When the size of the torus tends to innity, the expression of this kernel somehow sim-
plies (see [Pr√§03, equation (6.20)]). Also, the average growth velocity is equal to the
sum of the kink and antikink densities (independent of time by stationarity), and one
obtains [Pr√§03, Equation (6.24)]:
                                                                    
‚àÄ(x, y, t) ‚àà R √ó Z √ó R+      lim lim E h(x, y, t; œïM,N,œÅ , , [œâ]M,N ) = œÅ ¬∑ (x, y) + v(œÅ) t,
                             N ‚Üí‚àû M ‚Üí‚àû
                                                                                 (4.3.12)
with v(œÅ) as in (4.3.6).
    Pr√§hofer and Spohn also computed the covariance (or "structure function") between
kinks, antikinks and occupation variables (see [Pr√§03, Equation (6.30)] and [PS97, Equa-
tion (27) and (29)]). They deduced that, after taking the innite volume limit, the
variance of the height dierence at equilibrium is equivalent to œÄ ‚àí2 log((x, y)) as
(x, y)‚Üí ‚àû, but under the technical constraint that y/x is constant or x = o(y).
For our purposes, we will simply need the following upper bound that holds without
technical restriction on x, y :

            lim   lim Var (œïM,N,œÅ (x, y)) =         O      (log ((x, y))) .            (4.3.13)
           N ‚Üí‚àû M ‚Üí‚àû                            (x,y) ‚Üí‚àû


4.3. THE MAIN RESULT                                                                        63

Equation (4.3.13) can be is easily shown by bounding the variance of œïM,N,œÅ (x, y) by twice
the sum of the variance of œïM,N,œÅ (x, 0) and the variance of œïM,N,œÅ (x, y) ‚àí œïM,N,œÅ (x, 0)
(by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) which grow logarithmically w.r.t |x| and |y|, according
to the asymptotic computations of Pr√§hofer and Spohn.
    Finally, it can be shown that the kink/antikink covariance decays like the inverse
of the distance squared multiplied by a bounded oscillating term (an upper bound will
be proven in Appendix 4.B). Note that this is similar to the large-distance behavior of
dimer-dimer correlations in dimer models [Ken09]. From this, it is easy deduce (see
Appendix 4.B) that

Strategy of proof of Theorem 4.3.1
The crucial point is Proposition 4.3.5 which gives sucient conditions for identifying the
viscosity solution of (4.3.5). Most of these conditions are naturally satised by the mi-
croscopic Gates-Westcott dynamics, apart from the compatibility with linear solutions
which requires a study of the process started from the translation invariant stationary
measures, beyond what was obtained in [PS97, Pr√§03]. The rest of the proof is based
on compactness arguments, that allow to show sub-sequential existence of S(s, t, ¬∑) as
the limit of the random microscopic semi-group Sn (s, t, ¬∑, œâ), associated to the rescaled
Gates-Westcott dynamics. At the end, one identies the limiting continuous semi-group
thanks to Proposition 4.3.5. The main steps of the proof are summed up as follows:

  1.   Construction of a sequence of random discrete semi-groups (Sn (s, t; ., œâ))0‚â§s‚â§t,n‚ààN
       (that will be dened more precisely in Section 4.4.2, Denition 4.4.9):
                                        ‚éß
                                        ‚é®ŒìÃÑ ‚àí‚Üí F(R2 )
                      Sn (s, t; ., œâ) :
                                        ‚é©f  ‚àí‚Üí 1 h(n., n., n(t ‚àí s); œïfn , œÑns œâ),
                                                n

       with œïfn ‚àà Œì approaching f in the sense of (4.3.3):  n1 œïfn (n., n.)‚àíf ‚àû ‚â§ 2/n, œÑns œâ
       is the time translation by ‚àíns of œâ dened later in (4.4.8) and where F(R2 ) is the
       set of functions from R2 to R. The function Sn (s, t, f ; œâ) should be thought of as the
       rescaled height function following the dynamic starting close from the continuous
       initial prole f and with Poissonian creations taken between the macroscopic times
       s and t.

  2.   Compactness : Show that there exists a subset Œ©0 ‚äÜ Œ© of probability 1 such that for
       any xed œâ ‚àà Œ©0 , from any subsequence (nk )k‚ààN , we can extract a subsubsequence
       (nkl )l‚ààN such that for any function f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, (Snkl (¬∑, ¬∑; f, œâ))l‚ààN (seen as a sequence


64                      CHAPTER 4. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE GW MODEL
          of functions from {(s, t) ‚àà [0, T ]2 , s ‚â§ t} to F(R2 )) converges for the topology of
          uniform convergence on all compact sets to a certain limiting function S(¬∑, ¬∑; f, œâ)
          which is continuous in space and time. The proof relies on a control of spatio-
          temporal height dierences and on an adaptation of Arzel√†-Ascoli's Theorem (see
          Proposition 4.D.1).

     3.   Identication of the limit : Show that any such limit S(., .; ., œâ) satises the su-
          cient conditions of Proposition 4.3.5 thus (x, y, t) ‚Üí S(0, t; f, œâ)(x, y) is the unique
          viscosity solution of (4.3.5). The knowledge on equilibrium measures explained in
          section 4.3.3 will be used to show compatibility with linear solutions.


4.4 Construction of a sequence of random discrete semi-
    groups
Let us start by dening, for later use, the set of creations that lead to an actual height
increase.
Denition 4.4.1. For all œâ ‚àà Œ© and all œï ‚àà Œì, we dene the subset of eective creations:
                   œâ œï := {(x, y, t) ‚àà œâ : h(x, y, t; œï, œâ) ‚àí h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï, œâ) = 1}.     (4.4.1)
It is a subset of œâ that depends (non trivially) only on œï and œâ . For all y ‚àà Z, we dene
the restriction of œâ œï and œâ to line y :

4.4.1        Useful properties of the microscopic dynamic
In this section, we present useful properties satised by the microscopic dynamic that
will be useful to apply Proposition 4.3.5 later on but also to show compactness.
Lemma 4.4.2 (Translation invariance). For all constant m ‚àà Z, all œâ ‚àà Œ©, all œï ‚àà Œì
and all     t ‚àà R+ ,
                               h(¬∑, ¬∑, t; œï + m, œâ) = h(¬∑, ¬∑, t; œï, œâ) + m.                (4.4.4)
Proof.  Having xed œâ , by denition, the Gates-Westcott dynamic only depends on the
height dierences of the initial height function (kinks/antikinks and relative height dif-
ferences along y ). Therefore, the temporal height growth h(¬∑, ¬∑, t; œï, œâ) ‚àí œï depends on œï
only through its spatial height dierences hence is invariant by addition of a constant m
to the initial function œï.

Lemma 4.4.3 (Monotonicity). For all œï1, œï2 ‚àà Œì, for all œâ ‚àà Œ©, and all t ‚àà R+,
                            œï1 ‚â§ œï2 ‚áí h(., ., t; œï1 , œâ) ‚â§ h(., ., t; œï2 , œâ).             (4.4.5)


4.4. CONSTRUCTION OF A SEQUENCE OF RANDOM DISCRETE SEMI-GROUPS65

Proof.  As explained in Remark 4.2.3, the dynamic can be dened locally and thus it
is enough to show this Lemma when there are nitely many creations. It is not hard
to show that the deterministic part of the dynamic (lateral expansion and annihilation)
is non-decreasing with respect to the initial condition. We just have to check that any
creation preserves monotonicity.
    Suppose that there is a creation at (x, y, t) and that h(., ., s; œï1 , œâ) ‚â§ h(., ., s; œï2 , œâ)
for s < t. Let us show that h(x, y, t; œï1 , œâ) ‚â§ h(x, y, t; œï2 , œâ). If h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï1 , œâ) <
h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï2 , œâ), then there is nothing to show since the height can only jump by one
after a creation. If h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï1 , œâ) = h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï2 , œâ) and if the creation is allowed for
the dynamic starting from œï1 , then so it is for the one starting from œï2 because

 h(x, y ‚àí 1, t‚àí ; œï2 , œâ) ‚àí h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï2 , œâ) ‚â• h(x, y ‚àí 1, t‚àí ; œï1 , œâ) ‚àí h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï1 , œâ) = 1
                                                                                                 (4.4.6)
and

 h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï2 , œâ) ‚àí h(x, y + 1, t‚àí ; œï2 , œâ) ‚â§ h(x, y, t‚àí ; œï1 , œâ) ‚àí h(x, y + 1, t‚àí ; œï1 , œâ) = 0.
                                                                                                 (4.4.7)
In any case, the monotonicity is preserved after a creation.

    For œâ ‚àà Œ©, we dene œÑs œâ , the time translation by ‚àís of œâ as follows:

                 ‚àÄ(x, y, t) ‚àà R √ó Z √ó R+ , (x, y, t) ‚àà œÑs œâ ‚áî (x, y, t + s) ‚àà œâ.                (4.4.8)

Lemma 4.4.4 (Markov property). For all œï ‚àà Œì, all 0 ‚â§ s ‚â§ t and all œâ ‚àà Œ©,
                         h(., ., t; œï, œâ) = h(., ., t ‚àí s; h(., ., s; œï, œâ), œÑs œâ),             (4.4.9)

and for all 0 ‚â§ r ‚â§ s ‚â§ t,
                  h(., ., t ‚àí r; œï, œÑr œâ) = h(., ., t ‚àí s; h(., ., s ‚àí r; œï, œÑr œâ), œÑs œâ).    (4.4.10)

Proof.  From Remark 4.2.3, we can assume that œâ contains nitely many points. In this
case, the rst point follows directly from the construction of the dynamic. The second
point is obtained from the rst point applied to (s , t , œâ  ) = (s ‚àí r, t ‚àí r, œÑr œâ).

    Next, as announced in Remark 4.2.3, we are going to show that the dynamic on a
bounded space-time domain only depends on the initial height function and the creations
on a bigger domain that grows linearly with time with high probability. To make this
statement precise, for any x ‚àà R2 , R ‚â• 0, t ‚àà R+ and Œ± > 0, let us dene

Proposition 4.4.5 (Linear propagation of information). There exist constants                          Œ± > 1
and Œ≥ > 0, such that for all R > 0, all t ‚àà R+ and all x ‚àà R2 ,

Proof.   To lighten the notations, without loss of generality, we will assume that x = 0.
The idea of the proof is the following. If the height functions dier on B(0, R) √ó [0, t] and
if initial conditions and creations agrees on B(0, R + Œ±t), then there must exists a "chain
of creations" of length at least Œ±t (connecting B(0, R) to the complement of B(0, R + Œ±t))
in a time interval of length less than t (see Lemma 4.4.6). This is unlikely if Œ± is chosen
big enough and if t goes to innity.

Lemma 4.4.6. Let œï, œï ‚àà Œì agreeing on B(0, R+Œ±t) and œâ, œâ ‚àà Œ© agreeing on B(0, R+

exist a sequence (xi , yi , ti )0‚â§i‚â§k with k := Œ±t satisfying

      Before proving this Lemma, let us nish the proof of Proposition 4.4.5. If œâ ‚àà                    /

h(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑, œï; œÑu œâ) and h(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑, œï ; œÑu œâ  ) dier on B(x, R)√ó[0, t‚àíu]. By applying Lemma 4.4.6
at time t‚àíu and with creations œÑu œâ and œÑu œâ  we get a chain of creations (xi , yi , ti )0‚â§i‚â§ Œ±t
such that (xi , yi , ti + u)0‚â§i‚â§ Œ±t satises the 3 points in Lemma 4.4.6. In order to be
consistent with the denition of C ‚Üë in Appendix 4.C, we relabel this sequence by setting
(xi , yi , ti )0‚â§i‚â§ Œ±t := (x Œ±t ‚àíi , y Œ±t ‚àíi , t Œ±t ‚àíi + u)0‚â§i‚â§ Œ±t so that |xi+1 ‚àí xi |‚â§ ti+1 ‚àí ti .

and the proof of Proposition 4.4.5 is concluded by choosing any Œ≥ < Œ± ln 2.

Proof of Lemma 4.4.6. Let us introduce some notations (we will also use the notation
                                                                                        ‚àí
œâ œï , œâyœï as in Denition 4.4.1). For all (x, t) ‚àà R √ó R+ , we dene Cx,t                  := {(z, s) ‚àà
R √ó R+ , |z ‚àí x|‚â§ t ‚àí s}. By speed one propagation of kinks/antikinks, h(x, y, t, œï; œâ)
                           ‚àí
only depends on œâyœï ‚à© Cx,t     and on œï(z, y) for z ‚àà [x ‚àí t, x + t]. This fact can also be seen
as a consequence of Lemma 4.5.3 below. Now, we are going to construct by induction a
chain of creations like in Lemma 4.4.6.
     Construction of (x0 , y0 , t0 ) : Assume that there exists (x, y, s) ‚àà B(0, R) √ó [0, t] such
that we have h(x, y, s, œï; œâ) = h(x, y, s, œï ; œâ  ). Let us x such a (x, y, s) and set y0 := y .
By the discussion above, since œï(¬∑, y0 ) and œï (¬∑, y0 ) agree on the interval [‚àíR ‚àí Œ±t, R +
                                                                                                
Œ±t] ‚äá [x ‚àí t, x + t] (because |x|‚â§ R and Œ± > 1), necessarily œâyœï0 ‚à© Cx,s           ‚àí and (œâ  )œï ‚à© C ‚àí
                                                                                               y0    x,s
are distinct. In other words, we can nd (x0 , t0 ) ‚àà œây0 ‚à© Cx,s        ‚àí (= œâ  ‚à© C ‚àí by assumption
                                                                                y0    x,s
on œâ  ) corresponding to a kink/antikink creation that occurs for one of the dynamics but
not for both (and such that |x0 |‚â§ R + t ‚àí t0 ). Consequently, the height functions must
dier either at (x0 , y0 ‚àí 1, t‚àí                ‚àí                     ‚àí
                               0 ), (x0 , y0 , t0 ) or (x0 , y0 + 1, t0 ) (otherwise the creation would
have been accepted or rejected simultaneously in both dynamics).
     Construction of (xi+1 , yi+1 , ti+1 ) : According to the three possibilities above, we set
y1 to be equal to y0 ‚àí1, y0 or y0 +1 (respectively in the rst, second and third possibility).
If y1 is still in B(0, R + Œ±t), we can repeat the procedure above and nd some (x1 , t1 ) ‚àà
œây1 ‚à© Cx‚àí0 ,t0 (hence |x1 ‚àí x0 |‚â§ t0 ‚àí t1 ) corresponding to a creation that occurs for one
of the dynamic but not for both and so on. This construction continues as long as
yi ‚àà B(0, R + Œ±t) and note that yi cannot exit B(0, R + Œ±t) for i ‚â§ Œ±t. Overall, we
constructed a sequence as in Lemma 4.4.6. Its length is at least Œ±t + 1.

   Now, let us show a Lemma that relates the linear propagation of information with a
Lipschitz property with respect to the initial height prole.
Lemma 4.4.7. For all R ‚â• 0, all s ‚â§ t, all x ‚àà R2 and all n ‚àà N, the following event
happens with probability 1‚àíO (e‚àíŒ≥n ) as n goes to innity (with Œ≥ as in Proposition 4.4.5):

    sup      |h(z, v‚àíu; œï, œÑu œâ)‚àíh(z, v‚àíu; œï , œÑu œâ)|‚â§           sup         |œï(z)‚àíœï (z)|, (4.4.13)

for every œï, œï ‚àà Œì and every u, v such that ns ‚â§ u ‚â§ v ‚â§ nt (and with Œ± as in
Proposition 4.4.5).
Proof. By time translation invariance of the law of the Poisson process, we can assume
that s = 0.    We are going to show that the event      Anx,nR,nt,Œ± is included in the event in
the l.h.s. of (4.4.13). To do this, let us x    œâ ‚àà Anx,nR,nt,Œ± , œï, œï ‚àà Œì and 0 ‚â§ u ‚â§ v ‚â§ nt.

4.4. CONSTRUCTION OF A SEQUENCE OF RANDOM DISCRETE SEMI-GROUPS69

Remark 4.4.11. We cannot just choose œïfn := (x, y) ‚Üí    nf (n‚àí1 x, n‚àí1 y) because it could
possibly have an accumulation point of discontinuities if f oscillates too much; this would
violate the rst condition in Denition 4.2.1.

Proof.  For any xed y ‚àà Z, we are going to dene œïfn (¬∑, y) as piecewise constant on R+
(we will construct it similarly on R‚àí ). Let us dene inductively X0y = 0, œïfn (0, y) :=
 nf (0, y/n) and
       y
      Xi+1 := inf{x ‚â• Xiy , |nf (x/n, y/n) ‚àí œïfn (Xiy , y)|‚â• 1}             (with inf ‚àÖ = +‚àû)
                                            y
      œïfn (¬∑, y) = œïfn (Xiy , y) on (Xiy , Xi+1 )
        f     y                 y
      œïn (Xi+1 , y) = nf (Xi+1 /n, y/n).
                                                                                         y
By induction and by continuity of f , œïfn (Xiy , y) ‚àà Z for all i. Still by continuity, Xi+1 >
Xiy and {Xiy , i ‚àà N} is a locally nite subset of R+ with limi‚Üí‚àû Xiy = +‚àû. Similarly, we
construct œïfn (¬∑, y) on negative real numbers. Up to modifying the value at discontinuity
points, we obtain a function œïfn (¬∑, y) which satises point 1 of Denition 4.2.1 and which
                                                    ‚àí1
satises the translation invariance property œïfn+n c = œïfn +c for all c ‚àà Z by construction.
Moreover, by construction, for all (x, y) ‚àà R √ó Z, |œïfn (x, y) ‚àí nf (x/n, y/n)|‚â§ 1 and thus
          1
   sup | œïfn (nx, ny) ‚àí f (x, y)|
 (x,y)‚ààR2 n
                            1
              ‚â§     sup | œïfn (nx, ny) ‚àí f (x, ny/n)|+ sup |f (x, ny/n) ‚àí f (x, y)|
                  (x,y)‚ààR 2 n                           (x,y)‚ààR2

              ‚â§     + | ny/n ‚àí y|‚â§             because f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ.
                  n                 n
It remains to check that œïfn satises point 2 of Denition 4.2.1 and hence is in Œì. To
do this, let us x y ‚àà Z and show that for all x ‚â• 0, œïfn (x, y + 1) ‚àí œïfn (x, y) ‚àà {‚àí1, 0}
(the case x < 0 being similar). Let x ‚â• 0 and i, j be the unique integers such that
Xiy ‚â§ x < Xi+1y                     y+1
                 and Xjy+1 ‚â§ x < Xj+1   . By construction of œïfn ,

                                 œïfn (x, y) = nf (Xiy /n, y/n)
                           œïfn (x, y + 1) = nf (Xjy+1 /n, (y + 1)/n) .
                                             y
There are two cases: either Xjy+1 ‚àà [Xiy , Xi+1                       y+1
                                                ) or Xiy ‚àà [Xjy+1 , Xj+1  ). Since they are
                                                            y                        y
similar, we will just treat the rst one. By denition of Xi+1 , for all z ‚àà [Xiy , Xi+1 ) we
                             y
have |nf (z/n, y/n) ‚àí nf (Xi /n, y/n)|< 1 and thus

 œïfn (x, y + 1) ‚àí œïfn (x, y) = nf (Xjy+1 /n, (y + 1)/n) ‚àí nf (Xiy /n, y/n)
  = nf (Xjy+1 /n, (y + 1)/n) ‚àí nf (Xjy+1 /n, y/n) + nf (Xjy+1 /n, y/n) ‚àí nf (Xiy /n, y/n) .
    !                     "#                    $ !                  "#                 $
                     ‚àà[‚àí1,0] since f ‚ààŒìÃÑ                                                     y
                                                                 ‚àà(‚àí1,1) since Xjy+1 ‚àà[Xiy ,Xi+1 )


Finally, œïfn (x, y + 1) ‚àí œïfn (x, y) ‚àà (‚àí2, 1) ‚à© Z = {‚àí1, 0}.

4.5 Compactness
4.5.1     Control on spatio-temporal height dierences
In this section, we control the spatio-temporal gradients of the height function following
the Gates-Westcott dynamic by comparison with the PNG dynamic. By construction,
(x, t) ‚Üí h(x, y, t; œï, œâ) follows the PNG dynamic (see e.g [FP06, Section 2] for an intro-
duction to the model) starting from initial condition œï(¬∑, y) with creation locations given
by œâyœï as in Denition 4.4.1. This simple remark allows us to use the representation of
PNG model in terms of directed polymer on Poisson points (see [FP06, Section 3.1]).
First, we need to introduce some new denitions.
Denition 4.5.1. For any nite set A ‚äÜ R2, we dene L‚Üë(A) as the maximal number
of points in A that can be collected by a light-path i.e a continuous path Œ≥ : [0, 1] ‚Üí R2
satisfying that for any 0 ‚â§ a ‚â§ b, we have Œ≥(b) ‚àí Œ≥(a) ‚àà {(x, t) ‚àà R2 |x|‚â§ t}.
    We say that a rectangle R ‚äÜ R2 is a light-rectangle if its sides are parallel to the
straight lines t = x or t = ‚àíx. For any s < t and (x, s), (y, t) such that |y ‚àí x|‚â§ t ‚àí s,
we note R(x,s),(y,t) the unique light-rectangle of diagonal [(x, s), (y, t)].
Remark     4.5.2. We let the reader check that the area of R(x,s),(y,t) is ((t ‚àí s)2 ‚àí (y ‚àí x)2 )/2
and that if |x ‚àí x|‚â§ s ‚àí s then R(x,s),(y,t) ‚äÜ R(x ,s ),(y,t) while if |y  ‚àí y|‚â§ t ‚àí t then
R(x,s),(y,t) ‚äÜ R(x,s),(y ,t ) .
   The next Lemma is an easy extension to arbitrary initial conditions of the equivalence
between the PNG and the directed polymers model as explained in [FP06, Section 2.3
and 3.1] for special droplet and at initial conditions (see also Figure 4.2).
Lemma 4.5.3.          For al l   (x, y, t) ‚àà R √ó Z √ó R+ ,      al l   œï‚ààŒì   and   œâ ‚àà Œ©,

                    h(x, y, t; œï, œâ) =          sup     {œï(z, y) + L‚Üë (œâyœï ‚à© R(z,0),(x,t) )},              (4.5.1)
                                          z‚àà[x‚àít,x+t]

and the supremum is attained for some                 z ‚àà [x ‚àí t, x + t].
    In order to control the space gradients of the interface, we need an upper bound on
L‚Üë (œâyœï ‚à© R) (or on L‚Üë (œây ‚à© R) since œâyœï ‚äÜ œây ) for large rectangles R. This quantity
is well studied as it is related to the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a
random uniform permutation, which was shown rst by Hammersley to behave like the
square root of the number of Poisson points in R (this is also known as Ulam's problem;
see [Ham72]).
Lemma 4.5.4.          There exists a constant        c > 0 such that for          al l   œâ   in a subset of   Œ©   of

where   Leb(R) is      the area of   R.   Therefore, up to intersecting this subset of probability                1
with   Œ©0 (dened     in Corollary 4.4.8) we can assume that                (4.5.2)   holds for al l   œâ ‚àà Œ©0 .

We conclude the proof with Lemma 4.5.4 and Leb(R(x,2s‚àít),(x,t) ) = 2(t ‚àí s)2 .

    Now, we establish a crucial lemma that guarantees a priori that, at any time, the
asymptotic rescaled height function has at least the worst regularity between that of the
initial height prole and 1/2-H√∂lder regularity. A posteriori, after the proof of the main
theorem, we will have that it stays Lipschitz at any time if the initial condition is itself
Lipschitz since this is the case for viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

For this distance, a sequence of functions (fn )n‚ààN converges to f ‚àà F(R2 ) if and only if
it converges uniformly on all compact sets of R2 to f .
Proposition 4.5.8. The metric space                          is complete. The metric space
                                                     (F(R2 ), d‚àû,c )
(ŒìÃÑ, d‚àû,c )   is complete and separable (i.e. a Polish space).
Proof. The completeness of (F(R2 ), d‚àû,c ) is a classical fact. Since ŒìÃÑ is a closed subset
of C(R2 ) (which is complete because closed in F(R2 ) and separable by approximation
by polynomials with rational coecients on any compact set) it is in turn a complete
separable metric space.

    Now, we denote FT := F(T , F(R2 )) the set of functions from T (dened in Denition
4.4.9) into F(R2 ) which we endow with the uniform distance:
                  ‚àÄF1 , F2 ‚àà FT , D‚àû (F1 , F2 ) :=         sup     d‚àû,c (F1 (s, t), F2 (s, t)).           (4.5.8)

    The following Proposition is standard when dealing with functional spaces with a
complete set of destination such as F(R2 ) (by Proposition 4.5.8) and endowed with the
uniform distance.
Proposition 4.5.9. The metric space (FT , D‚àû) is complete.

Lemma 4.5.4. The goal of this section is to show the following proposition:

of functions ŒìÃÑ  f  ‚àí‚Üí Sn (¬∑, ¬∑, f ; œâ) ‚àà FT . From Propositions 4.5.8 and 4.5.9, ŒìÃÑ is sepa-
rable and FT is complete. Therefore, the proof of Proposition 4.5.10 follows easily from
Proposition 4.D.1 together with the next two lemmas giving asymptotic equi-continuity
and pointwise relative compactness.

Lemma 4.5.11 (Asymptotic equi-continuity of (f ‚Üí Sn (¬∑, ¬∑, f ; œâ))n‚ààN ).                    For all œâ ‚àà Œ©0

The proof comes from an easy corollary of (4.4.14) (we will prove it in details at the end

Proof of Lemma 4.5.12. We want to show that for any xed f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, from any sub-
sequence of ((s, t) ‚Üí Sn (s, t, f ; œâ))n‚ààN , we can nd a uniformly converging sub-sub-
sequence in FT . We are going to apply once again Proposition 4.D.1. The set FT is the
set of functions from T which is compact into (F(R2 ), d‚àû,c ) which is complete (by Propo-
sition 4.5.8). Therefore, it is enough to show asymptotic equi-continuity and pointwise
relative compactness.

                       As F(R2 ) is endowed with the topology of convergence on all
compact sets of R , it is enough to show asymptotic equi-continuity and pointwise relative
compactness in order to apply Proposition 4.D.1 once more.

     1.   Pointwise relative compactness: (Sn(s, t, f ; œâ)(x, y))n‚ààN ‚àà R
          By Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem, it suces to show that this sequence is bounded.
          The upper bound is a direct consequence of Proposition 4.5.5 while the lower bound
          is trivial since height functions are non-decreasing with time.

        By uniform continuity of f on any compact, the right-hand side tends to 0 when Œ¥

    Therefore, by Proposition 4.D.1, any subsequence of (Sn (s, t, f ; œâ))n‚ààN has a subse-
quence that converges in (F(R2 ), d‚àû,c ) and any limit point is continuous. Actually, by
taking the limit in (4.5.10), any limit point is in ŒìÃÑ. This concludes the proof of Lemma
4.5.13.

4.6 Identication of the limit
4.6.1       Properties of the limit points
In this section, we are going to show that any subsequential limit of (Sn (., .; f, œâ))n‚ààN (as
in Denition 4.4.9) satises the sucient conditions of Proposition 4.3.5, most of these
properties being automatically satised by the analogous microscopic properties stated
in Section 4.4.1 or by Proposition 4.5.10 concerning continuity.
Proposition 4.6.1.            Let œâ ‚àà Œ©0 and (nk )k‚ààN a subsequence such that for all f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ,
(Snk (¬∑, ¬∑; f, œâ))k‚ààN      converges to a certain S(¬∑, ¬∑; f, œâ) in FT , i.e
              ‚àÄR > 0,              sup |Snk (s, t, f ; œâ)(x, y) ‚àí S(s, t, f ; œâ)(x, y)| ‚àí‚Üí 0.
                                  (s,t)‚ààT                                                          k‚Üí‚àû
                                 |x|,|y|‚â§R

Any such limit (f ‚Üí S(s, t, f ; œâ))0‚â§s‚â§t‚â§T is a family of continuous functions from ŒìÃÑ into
itself satisfying the rst four properties listed in Proposition 4.3.5. Moreover, for any
f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, (s, t, x, y) ‚Üí S(s, t, f ; œâ)(x, y) is continuous.
Proof.   - Continuity : By Proposition 4.5.10, for all f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, (s, t) ‚Üí S(s, t, f ; œâ) is con-
tinuous from T into ŒìÃÑ (which is composed of continuous functions) hence (s, t, x, y) ‚Üí
S(s, t, f ; , œâ)(x, y) is continuous.
- Translation invariance : For any c ‚àà R, s ‚â§ t and k ‚àà N, by Lemma 4.4.2 and by
translation invariance property of œïfn stated in Proposition 4.4.10,
                                                                                       1

                                                                                       nk


4.6. IDENTIFICATION OF THE LIMIT                                                                         81

When k goes to innity, the right-hand side tends to S(s, t; f, œâ) + c in (F(R2 ), d‚àû,c )
while the left-hand side goes to S(s, t; f + c, œâ) by Lemma 4.5.11.
- Monotonicity : By (4.4.17), if f ‚â§ g , then for all k ‚àà N, œïfnk ‚â§ œïgnk + 4 so by Lemmas
4.4.3 and 4.4.2,
                          Snk (s, t, f ; œâ) ‚â§ Snk (s, t, g; œâ) + 4/nk .
Monotonicty follows by taking the limit k ‚Üí ‚àû.
- Locality : It is a direct consequence of Corollary 4.4.8 and (4.4.17).
- Semi-group : the fact that S(t, t, f ) = f , for all t ‚àà [0, T ] and f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ is an immediate
consequence of (4.4.17). Now, for any 0 ‚â§ r ‚â§ s ‚â§ t ‚â§ T , we have by Lemma 4.4.4,
                                1
          Snk (r, t, f ; œâ) =      h(n¬∑, n¬∑, n(t ‚àí s), h(¬∑, ¬∑, n(s ‚àí r), œïfnk ; œÑnr œâ); œÑns œâ),
                                nk
and since S(r, s, f ; œâ) ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, we can apply Snk (s, t, ¬∑; œâ) and write
                                               1                                 ;œâ)
             Snk (s, t, S(r, s, f ; œâ); œâ) =      h(n¬∑, n¬∑, n(t ‚àí s), œïnS(r,s,f     ; œÑns œâ).

4.6.2     Hydrodynamic limit for linear initial proles
The only condition missing to apply Proposition 4.3.5 is the compatibility with linear
initial proles. We start with the following result:
Proposition 4.6.2. For all œÅ ‚àà R √ó (‚àí1, 0), all t ‚àà [0, T ] and all (x, y) ‚àà R2:
                      œâ ‚àí a.s        Sn (0, t; fœÅ , œâ)(x, y) ‚àí‚Üí fœÅ (x, y) + t v(œÅ),                  (4.6.1)

with fœÅ := (x, y) ‚Üí œÅ ¬∑ (x, y).
   Before proving this Proposition, let us show the following Corollary that gives the
compatibility with linear solutions.


82                    CHAPTER 4. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE GW MODEL
Corollary 4.6.3. There exists Œ©1 ‚äÜ Œ© of probability one such that for all œâ ‚àà Œ©0 ‚à© Œ©1,
if (nk )k‚ààN is a subsequence      such that for all f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, (Sn   k
                                                                      (¬∑, ¬∑; f, œâ))k‚ààN   converges towards
S(¬∑, ¬∑; f, œâ) in F T , then

Proof of Corollary 4.6.3.         By Proposition 4.6.2, there exists a subset Œ©1 ‚äÜ Œ© of proba-
bility one such that (4.6.1) holds for any œÅ, t, x, y in a countable dense subset of their
respective set of denition. Therefore, for all œâ ‚àà Œ©0 ‚à© Œ©1 , any subsequential limit
S(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; œâ) of Sn (¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; œâ) satises that for any such œÅ, t, x, y ,

                              S(0, t, fœÅ ; œâ)(x, y) = fœÅ (x, y) + t v(œÅ).

By continuity with respect to (t, x, y) of both sides (by Proposition 4.6.1), this holds
actually for all (x, y) ‚àà R2 and t ‚àà [0, T ]. Similarly, by continuity of œÅ ‚Üí v(œÅ) (dened
in (4.3.6)) and of œÅ ‚Üí fœÅ on R √ó [‚àí1, 0] (including the endpoints of the interval) for
the topology of convergence on all compact sets and by continuity of f ‚Üí S(0, t, f ; œâ)
for the same topology (still by Proposition 4.6.1) we deduce that it holds also for all
œÅ ‚àà R √ó [‚àí1, 0]. Finally, we get the result for any s > 0 by the semi-group property
satised by S (by Proposition 4.6.1):

fœÅ + t v(œÅ) = S(0, t, fœÅ ; œâ) = S(s, t, S(0, s, fœÅ , œâ); œâ)
     = S(s, t, fœÅ + s v(œÅ); œâ) = S(s, t, gœÅ ; œâ) + s v(œÅ)     by translation invariance property

and thus S(s, t, fœÅ ; œâ) = fœÅ + (t ‚àí s) v(œÅ).

Proof of Proposition 4.6.2.    This proof requires the knowledge on equilibrium measures
developed by Pr√§hofer and Spohn in [Pr√§03, PS97]. As in section 4.3.3, we note œïM,N,œÅ
the height function with asymptotic average slope œÅ ‚àà R√ó(‚àí1, 0) (in the thermodynamic
limit N ‚Üí ‚àû, M ‚Üí ‚àû) and whose gradients are stationary w.r.t time for the periodised
Gates-Westcott dynamic (i.e the Poisson point process is periodised on a torus of size
2M and 2N and noted [œâ]M,N as in (4.3.9)). There are two key ingredients in this proof:
to show that, in the limit M, N ‚Üí ‚àû, œïM,N,œÅ approaches fœÅ in the sense of (4.3.3) and
that n‚àí1 h(0, 0, nt; œïM,N,œÅ , [œâ]M,N ) approaches fœÅ + t v(œÅ). From (4.3.10) and (4.3.12),
this is true on average. It remains to show concentration via variance estimates as in the
next Lemmas.

then Sn (0, t; fœÅ , œâ)(x, y) = Sn (0, t; fœÅ , [œâ]M,N )(x, y). Consequently, by (4.4.12) and since
Œ±M,N tends to innity when M, N tend to innity,

By (4.3.12), the rst term of the r.h.s in the last equality goes to zero when M, N tends to
innity. To treat the second term, we write h(nx, ny, nt; œïM,N,œÅ ) = h(0, 0, nt; œïM,N,œÅ )+
h(nx, ny, nt; œïM,N,œÅ )‚àíh(0, 0, nt; œïM,N,œÅ ) and use that the variance of the sum is smaller
than twice the sum of the variances:

 Var(h(nx, ny, nt; œïM,N,œÅ ))
      ‚â§ 2 Var (h(0, 0, nt; œïM,N,œÅ )) + 2 Var (h(nx, ny, nt; œïM,N,œÅ ) ‚àí h(0, 0, nt; œïM,N,œÅ ))
      = 2 Var (h(0, 0, nt; œïM,N,œÅ )) + 2 Var (œïM,N,œÅ (nx, ny)) .       by (4.3.11)

The rst term of the r.h.s is controlled by Lemma 4.6.4 and the second by (4.3.13).

4.6.3    Conclusion of the proof of Theorem 4.3.1
Propositions 4.5.10 (compactness) and Proposition 4.6.1 together with Corollary 4.6.3
provide all necessary ingredients to conclude the proof of Theorem 4.3.1.
Proposition 4.6.6. For all œâ ‚àà Œ©0 ‚à© Œ©1, all f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ and all R, T > 0,
                          sup            |Sn (0, t; f, œâ)(x, y) ‚àí u(x, y, t)| ‚àí‚Üí 0,         (4.6.15)

where u is the unique viscosity solution of (4.3.5).
Proof. Assume that convergence (4.6.15) does not hold for some œâ ‚àà Œ©0 ‚à© Œ©1 , f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ and
R, T > 0. Then, there exists Œµ > 0 and a subsequence (nk )k‚ààN such that
                           sup            |Snk (0, t; f, œâ)(x, y) ‚àí u(x, y, t)|‚â• Œµ.         (4.6.16)
                     |x|,|y|‚â§R,t‚àà[0,T ]

By Proposition 4.5.10, we can extract another subsequence (nkl )l‚ààN such that for all
g ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, the sequence (Snkl (¬∑, ¬∑; g, œâ))l‚ààN converges towards a certain S(¬∑, ¬∑; g, œâ) in F T .
By Proposition 4.6.1 and Corollary 4.6.3, (S(s, t, ¬∑; œâ))0‚â§s‚â§t‚â§T satises all sucient con-
ditions of Proposition 4.3.5. Therefore, (x, y, t) ‚Üí S(0, t, f ; œâ)(x, y) = u(x, y, t) is the
unique viscosity solution of (4.3.3) and thus (x, y, t) ‚Üí Snkl (0, t; g, œâ)(x, y) converges on
all compact sets of R2 √ó [0, T ] towards u when l goes to innity which is a contradiction
with (4.6.16).

4.A Sucient conditions for viscosity solutions of Hamilton-
    Jacobi equations
In this section, we give a self-contained proof of Proposition 4.3.5 which is inspired
from [Rez01, Lemma 5.3] and [Zha18, Proposition 7.1].

Proof.  Let us show that u : (x, t) ‚Üí S(0, t, f )(x) dened from R2 √ó [0, T ] to R is a
viscosity solution of (4.3.5). First of all, by assumption, u in continuous on Rd √ó [0, T ].
Then, by the Semi-group property:

                                     u(¬∑, 0) = S(0, 0, g) = g.

We are left to show that u is a subsolution (the proof that u is a supersolution being
identical). Let œÜ ‚àà C ‚àû (Rd √ó (0, T )) and (x0 , t0 ) ‚àà Rd √ó (0, T ) such that œÜ(x0 , t0 ) =
u(x0 , t0 ) and œÜ ‚â• u on a neighbourhood of (x0 , t0 ). At rst, we introduce the following
ane approximation of œÜ around x0 :

                           œà(x, t) := œÜ(x0 , t) + ‚àáœÜ(x0 , t0 ).(x ‚àí x0 ).

As œà and œÜ have the same value and derivatives at (x0 , t0 ), it is enough to show that

                                  ‚àÇt œà(x0 , t0 ) ‚â§ v(‚àáœà(x0 , t0 )),                        (4.A.1)

by studying œà(x0 , t0 ) ‚àí œà(x0 , t0 ‚àí Œ¥) for small positive Œ¥ .
   On the one hand, by the semi-group property and the denition of u,

                    œà(x0 , t0 ) = u(x0 , t0 ) = S(t0 ‚àí Œ¥, t0 , u(¬∑, t0 ‚àí Œ¥))(x0 ).         (4.A.2)

    On the other hand, it is easy to show that ‚àáœÜ(x0 , t0 ) ‚àà R √ó [‚àí1, 0] thanks to the
assumptions œÜ ‚â• u around (x0 , t0 ) with equality at (x0 , t0 ) and the slopes constraints sat-
ised by functions in ŒìÃÑ such as u(¬∑, t0 ). Therefore, by compatibility with linear solutions
and translation invariance,

          S(t0 ‚àí Œ¥, t0 , œà(., t0 ‚àí Œ¥))(x0 ) = œà(x0 , t0 ‚àí Œ¥) + Œ¥ v(‚àáœà(x0 , t0 )).          (4.A.3)

    We are left to compare S(t0 ‚àí Œ¥, t0 , œà(., t0 ‚àí Œ¥))(x0 ) with S(t0 ‚àí Œ¥, t0 , u(¬∑, t0 ‚àí Œ¥))(x0 ).
Thanks to locality and monotony, this can be done by comparing œà(., t0 ‚àíŒ¥) with u(¬∑, t0 ‚àí
Œ¥) in the ball B(x0 , Œ± Œ¥). By Taylor expansion of œÜ and œà at order 2 around (x0 , t0 ),
                                                                     

Moreover, u ‚â§ œÜ on a neighbourhood of (x0 , t0 ) hence u(¬∑, t0 ‚àí Œ¥) ‚â§ œÜ(¬∑, t0 ‚àí Œ¥) on

4.B Stationary kink/antikink correlations and proof of (4.3.14)
In this section, we give more details about the determinantal structure of the stationary
measures introduced in Section 4.3.3 and show that the kink/antikink correlations are
bounded by the inverse of the distance squared in order to deduce (4.3.14).
    Let us rst x M and N , the sizes of the torus, and a slope œÅ = (œÅ1 , œÅ2 ) ‚àà R √ó (‚àí1, 0).
The existence of a stationary height prole œïM,N,œÅ (with value xed e.g to 0 at the
origin) whose average slope approaches œÅ was already discussed in Section 4.3.3. The
height function (and in particular the kinks and antikinks) are totally determined by the
occupation variables Œ∑(x, y) for (x, y) ‚àà R √ó Z that take value 1 if there is a level line of
the height function passing by (x, y) (i.e if œïM,N,œÅ (x, y + 1) ‚àí œïM,N,œÅ (x, y) = ‚àí1) and 0
otherwise. In [Pr√§03], the author showed, that any moments of the occupation variables
can be computed thanks to a determinant: for any (x1 , y1 ), ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , (xm , ym ) ‚àà R √ó Z,

90                      CHAPTER 4. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE GW MODEL
with Œµ(k) = ‚àíŒ∑s cos(k) + iŒ∑a sin(k) and where Œ∑s > 0, Œ∑a ‚àà R are parameters uniquely
determined by œÅ. In particular, the law of œïM,N,œÅ admits an innite volume limit in the
sense that the average of any local function has a limit as N ‚Üí ‚àû after M ‚Üí ‚àû.
    Thanks to this determinental structure, Pr√§hofer and Spohn computed the innite
volume limit of the densities of kinks and antikinks and deduced the speed of growth
v(œÅ) (dened in (4.3.6)) depending on the slope œÅ. Furthemore, they computed the
covariance (or "structure function") between kinks, antikinks and occupation variables
(see [Pr√§03, Equation (6.30)] and [PS97, Equation (27) and (29)]). For our purposes, we
only need the antikink/antikink and kink/kink covariances between the origin and (x, y)

   2.   Pointwise relative compactness:         For all x ‚àà E , the sequence (fn (x))n‚ààN is contained
        in a compact set of F .
Then, for any subsequence (nk )k‚ààN , (fnk )k‚ààN has a subsequence that converges uniformly
on all compact subsets of E to a function f : (E, d) ‚Üí (F, d ). Moreover, any limit point
is continuous.
Proof.  For the sake of simplicity and since any subsequence (fnk )k‚ààN still satises as-
sumptions 1 and 2, we can assume that (fnk )k‚ààN = (fn )n‚ààN without loss of generality.
    Let E0 be a dense countable subset of E . By pointwise relative compactness and
a diagonal extraction argument, we can nd a subsequence (nl )l‚ààN such that for every
x ‚àà E0 , (fnl (x))l‚ààN converges in F . Let us show that actually, for all x ‚àà E , (fnl (x))l‚ààN
is a Cauchy sequence, hence converges in F . Let x ‚àà E and Œµ > 0. By assumption,
there exists Œ¥ > 0 such that (4.D.1) is satised. By density, we can nd x0 ‚àà E0 such
that d(x, x0 ) ‚â§ Œ¥ . As (fnl (x0 ))l‚ààN converges, it is a Cauchy sequence so for all l, m large
enough, d (fnl (x0 ), fnm (x0 )) ‚â§ Œµ and thus

for l, m large enough by (4.D.1). Let us call f the pointwise limit. By taking the limit
in (4.D.1), we get immediately that any such limit point is continuous.
    Now, let K be a compact subset of E and let us show that fnl converges to f
uniformly on K . Let Œµ > 0. By compactness and asymptotic equi-continuity assumption,
we can nd a covering of K by a nite number p ‚àà N of balls of centers x1 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ xp and
radius Œ¥1 , ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ , Œ¥p such that (4.D.1) is satised with (x, Œ¥) = (xi , Œ¥i ) for any i ‚àà {1, ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ p}.
Therefore, we can nd N ‚àà N such that for all l ‚â• N ,

Hydrodynamic Limit for the
Borodin-Ferrari dynamics
The Markov dynamics of interlaced particle arrays, introduced by A. Borodin and P.
Ferrari in [BF14], is a classical example of (2 + 1)-dimensional random growth model
belonging to the so-called Anisotropic KPZ universality class. In [LT18], a hydrodynamic
limit  the convergence of the height prole, after space/time rescaling, to the solution of
a deterministic Hamilton-Jacobi PDE with non-convex Hamiltonian  was proven when
either the initial prole is convex, or for small times, before the solution develops shocks.
In the present work, we give a simpler proof, that works for all times and for all initial
proles for which the limit equation makes sense. In particular, the convexity assumption
is dropped. The main new idea is a new viewpoint about "nite speed of propagation"
that allows to bypass the need of a-priori control of the interface gradients, or equivalently
of inter-particle distances.
    The content of this Chapter is has been taken from the article [LT20]. For this reason,
the notations adopted here may dier slightly from those of Chapter 3.

5.1 Introduction
In this work, we study a (2 + 1)-dimensional stochastic growth model, or equivalently
an irreversible Markov process for a two-dimensional system of interlaced particles which
perform totally asymmetric, unbounded jumps. This model was originally introduced
by A. Borodin and P. Ferrari in [BF14] (we will refer to it as Borodin-Ferrari dynamics)
together with a larger class of growth models that belong to the so-called Anisotropic
KPZ universality class [Wol91]; we refer to [LT18, Ton18, BF14] for a discussion of this
topic and for further references. Our focus here is not on interface uctuations but on
the hydrodynamic limit (i.e. the law of large numbers for the height prole H(x, t)). For
models in the AKPZ class, the rescaled height prole is conjectured to converge to the
viscosity solution of a non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi PDE [Bar13]
                                   ‚àÇt u + v(‚àáu) = 0,                                   (5.1.1)

96              CHAPTER 5. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE BF DYNAMICS
with non-convex Hamiltonian v . In fact, the feature that distinguishes the AKPZ class
from the usual KPZ class is that the Hessian D2 v has negative determinant [Wol91].
The absence of convexity has an important consequence on the hydrodynamic behavior.
First of all, there is no Hopf-Lax formula for the solution of (5.1.1). Moreover, there
is no hope that the subadditivity arguments developed in [Sep00, Rez02] apply, since
they would automatically yield a convex Hamiltonian. Let us recall that the methods
of [Sep00, Rez02] require (at the microscopic level) the so-called envelope property,
which is a strong version of monotonicity and which gives a microscopic analog of Hopf-
Lax formula. For AKPZ models, the envelope property simply fails to hold.
    In the previous work [LT18], the convergence (in probability) of the height prole
to the viscosity solution of (5.1.1) was proven, under the important restriction that
either the initial prole u0 is convex, or that time is smaller than the time when shocks
(discontinuities of ‚àáu) appear. Earlier, in [BF14, Th. 1.2] the result was shown for a
non-convex but very specic and integrable triangular initial condition; in ‚àö this case, it
was also proven that the height prole satises a central limit theorem on the log t scale.
In the present article we prove the hydrodynamic limit result for all initial proles and
for all times (and convergence holds almost surely). We do not address the behavior of

uctuations and in particular the very interesting question of how they behave along the
shocks; for one-dimensional growth models such as TASEP, uctuations at shocks have
been studied e.g. in [FN15]. Our proof is strongly inspired by the method developed by F.
Rezakhanlou in [Rez01]; in few words, it consists in showing that the Markov semigroup
that encodes the dynamics is tight in a certain topology and that all of its limit points
satisfy a set of properties that are sucient to identify them with the unique semi-group
associated to the PDE (5.1.1). These ideas have been recently employed in [Zha18,Ler20]
to obtain a full hydrodynamic limit for other (2 + 1)-dimensional growth models in the
AKPZ class, namely the domino shuing algorithm and the Gates-Westcott model
[PS97]. The reason why Rezakhanlou's method was not employed in [LT18] is that it
requires a strong (i.e. uniform with respect to the initial condition) form of locality or
of nite speed of propagation for the dynamics. Such property is easy to check for the
domino shuing or the Gates-Westcott dynamic, but it fails for the Borodin-Ferrari
dynamics. The reason for this is that particle jumps are not bounded; the larger the
typical inter-particle distance in the initial condition, the faster information propagates
through the system.
    The main new idea of the present work, that allows to overcome the limitations
of [LT18], is the following. The usual locality property would say that the height function
H(x, t), for xed x and t ‚â§ T , is with high probability not inuenced (for T large and
uniformly in the initial condition ) by the value of the initial prole H(¬∑, 0) outside a ball

of radius O(T ) centered at x. This fails for the Borodin-Ferrari dynamics: locality holds
but not uniformly, due to the lack of any a-priori control of typical inter-particle distances
at times t > 0. In contrast, our Proposition 5.3.5 shows that the height H(x, t) is entirely
determined by the height H on a certain deterministic, compact subset of space-time,
depending on (x, t) but independent of the initial condition. As explained in Section
5.3.2, underlying this property is a bijection between the Borodin-Ferrari dynamics and


5.2. THE MODEL AND THE MAIN RESULT                                                       97

a discretized version of the Gates-Westcott growth model. This bijection is the analogue
of the well-known mapping between the Hammersley process and the Polynuclear growh
(PNG) growth model [FP06].
    As a side remark, with respect to the method of [Rez01], we avoid studying directly
the convergence of the Markov semi-group; this is possible in our case because we know
the stationary measures of the process and their hydrodynamic behavior, which is not
the case in the framework of [Rez01].
   Organization of the article.      This work is organized as follows. The model and its
height function are dened in Section 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, while the main theorem is given
in Section 5.2.4. Section 5.3 proves a few general properties of the process, including the
new locality statement. Compactness of sequences of rescaled height proles is proven in
Section 5.4 and the identication of limit points with the solution of the PDE is obtained
in Section 5.5.


5.2 The model and the main result
5.2.1    The Borodin-Ferrari dynamics
We start by recalling the denition of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamics, as a Markov evolu-
tion of a two-dimensional array of interlaced particles. In the original reference [BF14],
particles perform jumps of length 1 to the right and can push a number n ‚â• 0 of other
particles; we rather follow the equivalent representation used in [Ton17, LT18], where
particles jump a distance k ‚â• 1 to the left, and no particles are pushed. The lattice
where particles live consists of an innite collection of discrete horizontal lines, labeled
by an index  ‚àà Z. Each line contains an innite collection of particles, each with a label
(p, ), p ‚àà Z. See Figure 5.1. Horizontal particle positions z(p,) are discrete:

                                 z(p,) ‚àà Z + ( mod 2)/2

(note that adjacent horizontal lines are displaced by a half interger).

Denition 5.2.1. We let Œ© be the set of particle congurations Œ∑ satisfying the following
properties:

  1. no two particles in the same line  share the same position z(p,) . We label particles
     in each line in such a way that z(p,) < z(p+1,) . Labels are attached to particles,
     and they do not change along the dynamics.

  2. particles are interlaced: for every  and p, there exists a unique p ‚àà Z such that
     z(p,) < z(p ,+1) < z(p+1,) (and, as a consequence, also a unique p ‚àà Z such that
     z(p,) < z(p ,‚àí1) < z(p+1,) ). Without loss of generality, we assume that p = p
     (and therefore p = p + 1). This can always be achieved by deciding which particle
     is labeled 0 on each line. Also, by convention, the particle labeled (0, 0) is the
     left-most one on line  = 0, with non-negative horizontal coordinate.

102             CHAPTER 5. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE BF DYNAMICS
rhombus denes the line the particle is on, and its horizontal coordinate corresponds to
the z(p,) coordinate of the particle. If lengths are rescaled in such a way that rhombi have
sides of length 1, then horizontal positions are shifted by half-integers between neighbor-
ing lines (as is the case for particles). It is well known (and easy to understand from the
picture) that horizontal positions of rhombi in neighboring lines satisfy the same inter-
lacing conditions as particle positions z(p,) , and that the tiling-to-particle conguration
mapping is a bijection.
    Given a rhombus tiling as in Figure 5.4 and viewing it as the boundary of a stacking
of unit cubes in R3 , a natural denition of height function is to assign to each vertex of
a rhombus the height (i.e. the z coordinate) w.r.t. the (x, y) plane of the point (in R3 )
in the corresponding unit cube. As a consequence, height is integer-valued and dened
on points that are horizontally shifted 1/2 w.r.t. centers of rhombi, i.e. on points of
G‚àó . The height function dened in the previous section equals the height of the stack of
cubes w.r.t. the (x, y) plane.

5.2.3    Slopes and speed
Here we dene the set of continuous height functions that are possible scaling limits of
the discrete height prole H , and the speed of growth function v (or Hamiltonian) that
appears in the limit PDE. Given an integer M , dene ŒìÃÑM to be the set of functions
f : R2 ‚Üí R that are non-decreasing in both coordinates and such that
                 f (x + Œª(1, 1)) ‚àí f (x)      1
                                         ‚â§1‚àí    for every x ‚àà R2 , Œª ‚àà R.
                            Œª                M
If f is dierentiable, this means that ‚àáf belongs to the triangle TM dened by
                  TM := {œÅ ‚àà R2 : œÅ1 , œÅ2 ‚â• 0, œÅ1 + œÅ2 ‚â§ 1 ‚àí M ‚àí1 }.                 (5.2.12)

    The average speed of growth of the interface in the translation invariant stationary
state of average slope œÅ was computed in [Ton17, CF17] and it turns out to be
                                  1 sin(œÄœÅ1 ) sin(œÄœÅ2 )
                         v(œÅ) =                         ‚â• 0,   œÅ‚ààT                   (5.2.14)

Also, v(¬∑) tends to +‚àû if œÅ ‚Üí (œÅÃÑ1 , 1 ‚àí œÅÃÑ1 ) with œÅÃÑ1 ‚àà (0, 1). On the other hand, v(¬∑)
does not admit a unique limit for œÅ ‚Üí (0, 1) or œÅ ‚Üí (1, 0) (any value in [0, +‚àû] can be
obtained as limit point).

also check that the determinant of the Hessian of v is negative (strictly negative in the
interior of T) and thus the model belongs to the AKPZ universality class [Wol91].

5.2.4    The hydrodynamic limit
We are now ready to state our main result:

Theorem 5.2.5. Given an integer M , let f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM and let (hL)L‚ààN ‚àà ŒìNM be a sequence
of height functions approaching f in the following sense:
                                                            
                                         1                  
                      ‚àÄR > 0         sup  hL ( Lx) ‚àí f (x) ‚àí‚Üí 0.
                                                                                     (5.2.15)

Then, for almost every realization W , the following hydrodynamic limit holds:

                                               u(¬∑, 0) = f.

Remark 5.2.6. The condition hL ‚àà ŒìM for some integer M makes sure that the dynamics
is well dened and satises the "nite speed of propagation" property (see Proposition
5.3.3); this condition could be somewhat weakened. On the other hand, the requirement
that f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM0 for some integer M0 (we take for simplicity M0 = M ) ensures that the
slopes remain uniformly away from the side œÅ1 + œÅ2 = 1 of the triangle T where the speed
v is singular. This condition is in a sense optimal: in fact, if f is for instance the ane
function of slope œÅ with œÅ1 + œÅ2 = 1 and hL approaches f as in (5.2.15), then the limit
height prole will be either +‚àû for all positive times (if œÅ1 ‚àà (0, 1)) or the limit is not
necessarily unique (if œÅ1 ‚àà {0, 1}), i.e. it may depend on the microscopic details of the
initial condition hL .
Remark 5.2.7. As observed above, the function v(¬∑) cannot be extended continuously to
the whole boundary of T, so Eq. (5.2.17) requires some care. What is really meant in
the theorem is that u is the unique viscosity solution of the PDE where v(¬∑) is replaced
by vÃÉ(¬∑), which is any Lipschitz extension of v(¬∑) to the whole R2 that coincides with v on
TM . Since in this case the Hamiltonian is Lipschitz and depends only on the gradient, the
standard theory of viscosity solutions implies that the solution u exists and is unique, and
the comparison principle shows that if f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM , then u(¬∑, t) ‚àà ŒìÃÑM for all times, so that u
does not depend on the way vÃÉ is dened outside TM . For a reference on Hamilton-Jacobi
equations, see e.g [Bar13, Sections 5 and 7].


5.3 Properties of the microscopic dynamic
In this section, we recall some basic properties of the dynamics following [LT18]. In
addition, we prove in Section 5.3.2 a new locality property that is crucial in the proof of
Theorem 5.2.5.


104               CHAPTER 5. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE BF DYNAMICS
5.3.1     Translation invariance, monotonicity and speed of propagation
We begin with a couple of easy facts:
Proposition 5.3.1. The dynamics satises the following properties:
   1. Vertical translation invariance: H(x, t; h + c, W ) = H(x, t; h, W ) + c for all c ‚àà Z
   2. Monotonicity: h ‚â§ h ‚áí H(x, t; h, W ) ‚â§ H(x, t; h , W ).
                                                                


    The former statement is trivial and the latter follows from [LT18, Th. 5.7].
    Next, we recall a locality property established in [LT18] and we improve it to an
almost sure statement (but the really new locality result will come in next section).
Informally, Proposition 5.12 in [LT18] tells that if we x a lattice site x and an initial
height function h ‚àà Œì , then with probability 1‚àíO(exp(‚àíc(M )n) the height function at
x up to time n only depends on the Poisson clocks at positions within distance O(n) from
                         M


x. Without much extra eort (we leave details to the reader), it is possible to show the
following slightly stronger statement (the dierence with respect to [LT18, Prop. 5.12]
is that the claim (5.3.1) holds simultaneously for every h ‚àà Œì ):       M

Lemma 5.3.2. Fix         x ‚àà Z2 .For every integer M , there exist c = c(M ) > 0 and
Œî = Œî(M ) > 0 such that the following holds for every x ‚àà Z2 . For every integer n, there
exists a set of realizations W of probability 1 ‚àí ce‚àín/c of the Poisson process on which
the following holds for any h ‚àà ŒìM :
                        H(x, t; h, W ) = H(x, t; h, WÃÉ )   for every t ‚â§ Œîn,                     (5.3.1)
for every WÃÉ that coincides with W on2
                                   Rn (x) := B(x, 2n) √ó [0, Œîn],

with B(x, r) the ball of radius r centered at x.
   In the proof of Theorem 5.2.5, we need instead an almost sure result:
Proposition 5.3.3 (Finite speed of propagation). There exists a function N  M ‚Üí
Œ±(M ) < ‚àû such that for almost every W the following holds: for every integer M , every
time T > 0, every x0 ‚àà R2 and every R ‚â• 0, we have for L large enough
      H(x, t; h, W ) = H(x, t; h, WÃÉ )   for every t ‚â§ LT, x ‚àà B(Lx0 , LR), h ‚àà ŒìM               (5.3.2)
for every WÃÉ that coincides with W on
                                B(Lx0 , L(R + Œ±(M )T )) √ó [0, LT ].                              (5.3.3)
   2
     Here, we are viewing W as a locally nite subset of points of G √ó R+ , where the rst coordinate
corresponds to position of sites where the clocks ring, and the second coordinate corresponds to the time
when they ring.


5.3. PROPERTIES OF THE MICROSCOPIC DYNAMIC                                                         105

Proof. If we apply Lemma 5.3.2 with n := LT /Œî!, use an union bound for all x in
B(0, L2 ) (so that it includes all x in B(Lx0 , LR) for any xed x0 ‚àà R2 and all L large
enough) and apply Borel-Cantelli Lemma, we get the following. For almost every W ,
every integer M , every rational T > 0, every x0 ‚àà R2 and every R ‚â• 0, (5.3.2) holds all
L large enough and for every WÃÉ that coincides with W on the domain B(Lx0 , L(R +
Œ±T )) √ó [0, LT ] with Œ± chosen large enough (Œ± = 2Œî‚àí1 suces) such that this domain
contains every R LT /Œî (x) with x ‚àà B(Lx0 , LR). The rest of the proof follows from
rational approximation of T .

Corollary 5.3.4 (Weak Locality). For almost every W the following holds: for every
integer M , every T      > 0,   every R ‚â• 0, for L large enough
           sup       |H(x, t; h, W ) ‚àí H(x, t; h , W )|‚â§        sup          |h(x) ‚àí h (x)|   (5.3.4)
         x‚ààB(0,LR)                                          x‚ààB(0,L(R+Œ±T ))
           t‚â§LT


for every h, h ‚àà ŒìM , with Œ± = Œ±(M ) as in Proposition 5.3.3.
Proof.  We x W in the event of probability 1 of Proposition 5.3.3. Let M ‚àà N, T >
0, R ‚â• 0 and let h, h ‚àà ŒìM . We dene m as the supremum in the r.h.s of (5.3.4) and we
set h := h + m. Since h ‚â§ h on B(0, L(R + Œ±T )), the local version of monotonicity
stated in [LT18, Theorem 5.10] implies that for all L ‚â• 1

              H(x, t; h, WÃÉ ) ‚â§ H(x, t; h , WÃÉ ) for every x ‚àà B(0, LR), t ‚â§ LT

where WÃÉ is the restriction of W to B(0, L(R + Œ±T )) √ó [0, LT ]. By nite speed of propa-
gation (Proposition 5.3.3) and by vertical translation invariance (Proposition 5.3.1), for
all L large enough, we have for all t ‚â§ LT and x ‚àà B(0, LR),

                 H(x, t; h, W ) = H(x, t; h, WÃÉ ) ‚â§ H(x, t; h , WÃÉ )
                                    = H(x, t; h + m, W ) = H(x, t; h , W ) + m.

Similarly, we can show that for all L large enough, for all t ‚â§ LT and x ‚àà B(0, LR),
H(x, t; h , W ) ‚â§ H(x, t; h, W ) + m, which concludes the proof of Corollary 5.3.4.

    We point out that the speed of propagation Œ±(M ) is not uniform in M . This is a
problem, since later we would need to apply the propagation of information result from
time s > 0 to time t > s but, while we know by construction that the initial condition
belongs to ŒìM , the same does not hold at the later times s > 0 (and we do not see how
to obtain an apriori control on M (s) such that Œ∑(s) ‚àà ŒìM (s) ). This is the main diculty
that prevented a proof of a full hydrodynamic limit in [LT18] and this is why we call a
result like Corollary 5.3.4 weak locality (it is much weaker than the locality statements
used e.g. in [Ler20,Rez01,Zha18] to prove full hydrodynamic limits). One of the novelties
of this article is a smarter locality property that we state and prove in the next section.

5.4.1    Reducing to a simpler initial condition
From [LT18, Lemma 2.5] we have that, given f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM for some integer M as in the
statement of Theorem 5.2.5 and any L ‚àà N, there exists a natural discrete height function
hfL (x) that satises (a stronger version of) (5.2.15): it suces to set hfL (x) := Lf (x/L).
Then, hfL ‚àà ŒìM and moreover one has
                                               

which is stronger than (5.2.15).
    A simple consequence of Corollary 5.3.4 is that it is sucient to prove Theorem 5.2.5
for the initial condition hfL . Indeed, if (hL )L‚ààN ‚àà ŒìN     M converges to f in the sense of
(5.2.15), then by an immediate consequence of Corollary 5.3.4, for all T, R ‚â• 0,

5.4.2    Bound on temporal height dierences
The goal of this section is to obtain a control on the temporal height dierences that will
be useful for showing compactness of the sequence (HL (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ))L‚ààN .
Proposition 5.4.2. For almost every W , for every integer M , there exists a constant
C = C(M )   such that for all x ‚àà R2 , t ‚â• 0, Œ¥ > 0 and all f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM ,
                                                                     ‚àö     ‚àö

Proof. Let x ‚àà R2 , t ‚â• 0, Œ¥ > 0, f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM . Since the height functions are non-increasing
with time, it is enough to get an upper bound on
                          HL (x, t ‚àí Œ¥; f, W ) ‚àí HL (x, t + Œ¥; f, W ).
   The next Lemma relates the height dierences to increasing subsequences of Poisson
points.

     The proof is easy and is postponed to the end of the section.
     With Lemma 5.4.3, Borel-Cantelli Lemma, and a rational approximation argument
it is possible to show that for almost every W , for all M, x, t, Œ¥ as in Proposition 5.4.2,
for all L large enough, for all h ‚àà ŒìM ,

   H( Lx, L(t ‚àí Œ¥); h, WÃÉ ) ‚àí H( Lx, L(t + Œ¥); h, WÃÉ ) ‚â§ 2e             L2Œ¥ √ó LŒ±(t + Œ¥),   (5.4.4)

with WÃÉ the restriction of W to B( Lx, LŒ±(t + Œ¥)) √ó [0, (t + Œ¥)L] (cf. (5.3.3)). The rest
of the proof follows from Proposition 5.3.3 and by setting C(M ) = 2e 2Œ±(M ).


Proof of Lemma 5.4.3.      By denition, if H(x, s; h, W ) ‚àí H(x, t; h, W ) ‚â• k , then k par-
ticles crossed x between time s and t. We denote by (p, ) the label of the left-most
                                               ¬Ø
particle to the right of x at time s (i.e  = (x)  and p = min{p, z(p,) (s) > zÃÑ(x)}). Since
k particles crossed x in the time interval [s, t], there exist some time tk‚àí1 ‚àà [s, t] where
particle (p + k ‚àí 1, l) crossed x and landed at some position zk‚àí1 < zÃÑ(x). Necessarily,
(zk‚àí1 , , tk‚àí1 ) ‚àà W (since it corresponds to a jump) and particle (p + k ‚àí 2, ) was strictly
on the left of zk‚àí1 at time tk‚àí1 (otherwise, the jump could not have occurred). This
proves the case k = 1. If k ‚â• 2, since particle (p + k ‚àí 2, ) was on the right of zÃÑ(x) (and
zk‚àí1 ) at time s, there exists some tk‚àí2 ‚àà [s, tk‚àí1 ] when it jumped strictly on the left of
zk‚àí1 and landed at some zk‚àí2 < zk‚àí1 with (zk‚àí2 , , tk‚àí2 ) ‚àà W . The proof proceeds by
induction.
    The upper bound on the probability that such a sequence exists is standard (see
e.g [Sep96, Lemma 4.1]), so we omit it.

112                CHAPTER 5. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE BF DYNAMICS
Proof. Let us x W in the event of probability one on which Proposition 5.4.2 and
Corollary 5.3.4 hold simultaneously. Since ŒìÃÑ is the countable union of the ŒìÃÑM and since
R2 √ó R+ can be written as a countable union of [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ], modulo a standard
diagonal extraction procedure, we can restrict ourselves to the case of ŒìÃÑM for a xed M
and of a xed compact set [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ].
   Let us start by showing the following Lemma where the function f is xed.
Lemma 5.4.5. Let R, T > 0 and f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM . For almost every realisation of W , the
following holds: every subsequence (Lk )k‚ààN contains a sub-subsequence (Lk )m‚ààN such      m

for certain a function H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) ‚àà C([‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ]).
Proof. Keeping in mind the ideas of the Arzel√†-Ascoli Theorem, we will rst show point-
wise boundedness and asymptotic equi-continuity with respect to (x, t).
   1.   Pointwise boundedness: By Proposition 5.4.2 (with Œ¥ = t), the height function
        grows at most linearly i.e there exists C  > 0 such that
            ‚àÄx, t ‚àà R2 √ó R+ ,         lim sup|HL (x, t; f, W ) ‚àí HL (x, 0; f, W )|‚â§ C  t.    (5.4.7)

   2.   Asymptotic equi-continuity with respect to x, t: Equi-continuity in x is automatic
        because the spatial discrete gradients of the interface are bounded by 1. Thus,
                                                                                       1

        Moreover, asymptotic equi-continuity with respect to t is a direct consequence of
        Proposition 5.4.2 and thus for all x, t, and Œ¥ > 0,
                                                                          ‚àö      ‚àö

    Now, let (Lk )k‚ààN be a subsequence. By pointwise boundedness and by diagonal
extraction, we can nd a sub-subsequence (Lkm )m‚ààN such that for all x, t ‚àà S , with S
a countable dense countable subset of [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ], the sequence of real numbers
(HLkm (x, t; f, W ))m‚ààN converges to some limit to some H‚àû (x, t; f, W ).
    Let us extend this limit to the whole [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ]. By asymptotic equi-continuity
(5.4.8) and by density of S , it is not hard to show that for any (x, t) ‚àà [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ],
the sequence of real numbers (HLkm (x, t; f, W ))m‚ààN is a Cauchy sequence and thus also
converges. Consequently, (HLkm (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ))m‚ààN converges pointwise on [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ]
to some H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) which is automatically continuous by taking the limit in (5.4.8).
    It remains to show that the convergence is uniform. This is easily done by using
compactness of [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ] and asymptotic equi-continuity (5.4.8) so we omit the
proof.


5.5. IDENTIFICATION OF THE LIMIT                                                                  113

     Let us nish the proof of Proposition 5.4.4. Since ŒìÃÑM is separable for the topology of
convergence on all compact sets, we can nd a countable dense subset that we call S  . By
Lemma 5.4.5 and diagonal extraction, from any subsequence (Lk )k‚ààN , we can extract a
sub-subsequence (Lkm )m‚ààN such that for any function g ‚àà S  , (HLkm (¬∑, ¬∑; g, W ))m‚ààN con-
verges uniformly on [‚àíR, R]2 √ó[0, T ] to a continuous function H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; g, W ) ‚àà C([‚àíR, R]2 √ó
[0, T ]).
     We are going to extend this limit to any f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM by showing that (HLkm (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ))m‚ààN
is a Cauchy sequence in the space of functions from [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ] into R endowed
with the uniform convergence which makes it complete. For this, we will need to use
some equi-continuity with respect to f . It follows from Corollary 5.3.4 and from (5.4.1)
that for all r ‚â• 0 and all f, g ‚àà ŒìÃÑM ,

   lim sup sup |HL (x, t; f, W ) ‚àí HL (x, t; g, W )| ‚â§             sup       |f (x) ‚àí g(x)|.   (5.4.9)
    L‚Üí‚àû x‚ààB(0,r)                                              x‚ààB(0,r+Œ±T )
         t‚àà[0,T ]

Fix r large enough such that B(0, r) contains [‚àíR, R]2 and x f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM . Since the
r.h.s of (5.4.9) can be taken arbitrarily small by choosing g ‚àà S  close enough to f
and since (HLkm (¬∑, ¬∑; g, W ))m‚ààN is a Cauchy sequence for the uniform convergence on
[‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ], this is also the case for (HLkm (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ))m‚ààN . In conclusion, for any
f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM , (HLkm (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ))m‚ààN converges uniformly on [‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ] to a continuous
function H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) ‚àà C([‚àíR, R]2 √ó [0, T ]). This concludes the proof of Proposition
5.4.4.


5.5 Identication of the limit
All along this section, we will denote by H‚àû any continuous limit obtained by extraction
of the sequence of rescaled height functions (HL )L‚ààN as in Proposition 5.4.4. In order to
nish the proof of Theorem 5.2.5, we need to show that there is only one possible limit
H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W )that coincides almost surely with the unique viscosity solution of (5.2.17).

5.5.1    Properties of limit points
First of all, let us show some properties of H‚àû , inherited from those of the microscopic
dynamics.
Proposition 5.5.1 (Vertical translation invariance). For almost every W , every f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ
and c ‚àà R,
                              H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f + c, W ) = H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) + c.
Proof.From the denition of hfL = Lf (x/L), we observe that hfL + Lc ‚â§ hfL+c ‚â§
hfL + Lc + 1. By Proposition 5.3.1, we deduce that
                               Lc                                             Lc + 1
         HL (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) +        ‚â§ HL (¬∑, ¬∑; f + c, W ) ‚â§ HL (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) +         ,
                               L                                                 L
which concludes the proof by taking the limit when L goes to innity.

where we used Proposition 5.5.1 in the equality in the second line. Then, since we
enlarged EÃÑx,t,Œ¥ by Œ∑ > 0, it is not hard to check that, for all L large enough,
                                                                       Œ∑

   Finally, we need to need the hydrodynamic limit in the easy case where the initial
prole is linear.

Proposition 5.5.4 (Hydrodynamic limit for linear proles). For œÅ ‚àà T, we let fœÅ(x) :=
œÅ ¬∑ x.   For almost every W ,
                         H‚àû (¬∑, t; fœÅ , W ) = fœÅ ‚àí v(œÅ) t     ‚àÄt ‚â• 0, ‚àÄœÅ ‚àà T.           (5.5.3)

Proof.    Consider rst œÅ in the interior of T and let
                             +
                            H‚àû (x, t; fœÅ , W ) := lim sup HL (x, t; fœÅ , W )

and analogously with the liminf for H‚àû ‚àí (x, t; f , W ). We will prove that, for any given
                                                 œÅ
x, t, one has W -a.s.
                            +
                           H‚àû (x, t; fœÅ , W ) ‚â§ fœÅ (x) ‚àí v(œÅ)t,                     (5.5.4)
(an analogous statement holds for H‚àû    ‚àí (x, t; f , W )). Given this, it is then easy to deduce
                                                  œÅ
that (5.5.3) holds, W -a.s., simultaneously for all x and for all t, using the continuity of
(x, t) ‚Üí H‚àû (x, t; fœÅ , W ). Moreover, by continuity of œÅ ‚Üí v(œÅ) and œÅ ‚Üí H‚àû (x, t; fœÅ , W )
on T (thanks to Proposition 5.5.2), we can also deduce that (5.5.3) holds simultaneously
for all œÅ ‚àà T.
                     ‚ó¶
    Let us x œÅ ‚àà T and x, t (we assume without loss of generality that x = 0) and let
                                                                                    f
us prove that (5.5.4) holds W -as. First of all, we replace the initial condition hLœÅ by a
(random) initial condition, that we call hstat (stat for stationary), sampled from the
stationary measure œÄœÅ with average slope œÅ, with height xed to Œ¥L/2 at position x = 0.
We recall from [Ton17] that œÄœÅ corresponds to the translation invariant Gibbs measure on
rhombus tilings of the plane with average slope œÅ [Ken09] and that it is a time-stationary
measure for the interface gradients. Note that the L-dependence of hstat is trivial: only
the height oset is L-dependent. We call HLstat (¬∑, t; œÅ, W ) the corresponding (space-time
rescaled) height function at (macroscopic) time t, in analogy with (5.4.2). It is well
known that, for any R > 0, one has œÄœÅ -a.s. that

                            f
                 hstat ‚â• hLœÅ = œÅ ¬∑ x on B(0, LR), for L large enough.                  (5.5.5)

Given a positive constant C , let us consider the localised dynamics where the Poisson
clocks outside the ball B(0, LC) are turned o in the time interval [0, Lt], i.e., where W
is replaced by WÃÉ := W ‚à© (B(0, LC) √ó [0, Lt]). By local monotonicity (more precisely,
apply [LT18, Th. 5.10]) and by (5.5.5), we deduce that

                   HLstat (0, t; œÅ, WÃÉ ) ‚â• HL (0, t; fœÅ , WÃÉ ), for L large enough.

Now, from Proposition 5.3.3 we have that W -a.s.,

                    HL (0, t; fœÅ , WÃÉ ) = HL (0, t; fœÅ , W ), for L large enough,


116                CHAPTER 5. HYDRODYNAMIC LIMIT FOR THE BF DYNAMICS
if C is chosen large enough. Similarly, one has almost surely with respect to the joint
law of W and of the initial condition hstat ,

                   HLstat (0, t; œÅ, WÃÉ ) = HLstat (0, t; œÅ, W ), for L large enough.

This follows (again, for C large enough) from [LT18, Prop. 5.13]. In conclusion, we get
that almost surely with respect to the joint law of W and of hstat ,

                    HLstat (0, t; œÅ, W ) ‚â• HL (0, t; fœÅ , W ), for L large enough        (5.5.6)

and therefore it is enough to show (5.5.4) for H stat instead of H .
   By Borel-Cantelli Lemma, it is enough to prove the summability in L of

                  P(HLstat (0, t; œÅ, W ) ‚â• ‚àív(œÅ)t + Œ¥)
                                                                                         (5.5.7)
                   = P(HLstat (0, t; œÅ, W ) ‚àí HLstat (0, 0; œÅ, W ) ‚â• ‚àív(œÅ)t + Œ¥/2),

for any Œ¥ > 0 where now P is the joint law of the process and of the initial condition.
On the one hand, it follows from [Ton17, CF17] that ‚àív(œÅ)t is nothing but the average
growth:                                                        
                   E HLstat (0, t; œÅ, W ) ‚àí HLstat (0, 0; œÅ, W ) = ‚àív(œÅ)t.      (5.5.8)

On the other hand, [CFT19, Th. 2.2] showed that Var H (0, t, œÅ) ‚àí H stat (0, 0, œÅ) =
O(log t) which implies that
                                                                           
                Var HLstat (0, t; œÅ, W ) ‚àí HLstat (0, 0; œÅ, W ) = O L‚àí2 log L            (5.5.9)
                                                                   L‚Üí‚àû

which is summable in L. The rest of the proof follows from Chebyshev's inequality.

5.5.2      Viscosity solution
Let us show the following:

Proposition 5.5.5. For almost every W , the following holds: for every f     ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, every
(x, t) ‚àà R2 √óR>0 and every smooth function œï of space and time such that H‚àû (x, t; f, W ) =
œï(x, t) and H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) ‚â§ œï (resp. ‚â• œï) in a neighborhood of (x, t),

           if ‚àáœï(x, t) ‚àà T, then ‚àÇt œï(x, t) + v(‚àáœï(x, t)) ‚â§ 0         (resp. ‚â• 0).      (5.5.10)

Remark 5.5.6. Observe that, because of the restriction ‚àáœï(x, t) ‚àà T, the statement is a
priori weaker than saying that H‚àû is a viscosity solution in the usual sense.

Proof. Suppose that H‚àû (x, t; f, W ) = œï(x, t), H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) ‚â§ œï in a neighbourhood of
(x, t) (the case H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) ‚â• œï is similar, so we will not treat it) and ‚àáœï(x, t) ‚àà T.
Let us start by replacing œï by an ane function œà by setting for all y ‚àà R2 et s ‚â• ‚àít

        œà(x + y, t + s) := œï (x, t) + y1 ‚àÇx1 œï(x, t) + y2 ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t) + s ‚àÇt œï(x, t).   (5.5.11)

By Taylor expansion at order 2, there exists some C > 0 such that for all small enough

Now, we need the following Lemma in order to apply Proposition 5.5.3 afterwards.
Lemma 5.5.7. There exists œÅ = œÅ(x, t) ‚àà T and, for every Œ¥ > 0 small enough, there
exists cŒ¥ = cŒ¥ (x, t) ‚àà R such that
                         H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; fœÅ + cŒ¥ , W ) = œà + CŒ¥ 2      on EÃÑx,t,Œ¥ .             (5.5.14)

                       cŒ¥ = œï(x, t) ‚àí Œ¥ ‚àÇt œï(x, t) ‚àí fœÅ (x) + v(œÅ)(t ‚àí Œ¥) + CŒ¥ .

   Let us rst admit this Lemma and conclude the proof of Proposition 5.5.5. By
Proposition 5.5.3, inequality (5.5.13) and Lemma 5.5.7,

      œï(x, t) = H‚àû (x, t; f, W ) ‚â§ H‚àû (x, t; fœÅ + cŒ¥ , W )
                = fœÅ (x) + cŒ¥ ‚àí v(œÅ)t                                  by Proposition 5.5.4
                = œï(x, t) ‚àí Œ¥ ‚àÇt œï(x, t) ‚àí Œ¥ v(œÅ) + CŒ¥ 2               by (5.5.15).

Since this holds for all small enough Œ¥ > 0, we nally get that

                                     ‚àÇt œï(x, t) + v(œÅ) ‚â§ 0.                               (5.5.16)

Now, combining (5.5.16) and the second equality in (5.5.15),

                            ‚àÇx1 œï(x, t) + ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t) ‚â§ œÅ1 + œÅ2 .                         (5.5.17)

Then, since v is increasing with respect to œÅ1 + œÅ2 (see Remark 5.2.4) and since œÅ1 ‚àí œÅ2 =
‚àÇx1 œï(x, t) ‚àí ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t), we deduce that

Finally, from (5.5.16), we get what we wanted:

                               ‚àÇt œï(x, t) + v(‚àáœï(x, t)) ‚â§ 0.                              (5.5.19)

                                                                                       (5.5.23)

The rst equation xes the value of œÅv = ‚àÇx1 œï(x, t) ‚àí ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t) which belongs to ] ‚àí 1, 1[
(since ‚àáœï(x, t) ‚àà T by assumption). Now, by Remark 5.2.4, for xed œÅv , the function
œÅh ‚Üí œÅh +vÃÇ(œÅh , œÅv ) is strictly increasing and thus is a bijection from [|œÅv |, 1) to [|œÅv |, +‚àû).
(The reason behind this fact can be traced back to the bijection between the Borodin-
Ferrari dynamics and the (discretized) Gates-Westcott one, mentioned in Section 5.3.2).
Besides, since H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) ‚â§ œï on a neighbourhood of (x, t) with equality at (x, t) and
since H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) is non-increasing w.r.t time, we deduce that necessarily ‚àÇt œï(x, t) ‚â§
0. Moreover, ‚àÇx1 œï(x, t), ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t) ‚â• 0 (since ‚àáœï(x, t) ‚àà T by assumption) and thus
‚àÇx1 œï(x, t) + ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t) ‚â• |‚àÇx1 œï(x, t) ‚àí ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t)|. Consequently, we have

                        ‚àÇx1 œï(x, t) + ‚àÇx2 œï(x, t) ‚àí ‚àÇt œï(x, t) ‚àà [|œÅv |, +‚àû[

and thus there exists (a unique) œÅh ‚àà [|œÅv |, 1) satisfying the second equation in (5.5.23).
This nally imposes the value of œÅ and of cŒ¥ (by the third equation in (5.5.15)).

To conclude this section, we need to show that there is at most one viscosity solution in
the sense of Proposition 5.5.5.

Proposition 5.5.8. There exists a most one continuous function u on R2 √ó R+ with
initial condition f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ which is a viscosity solution of       (5.2.17)   in the sense of   (5.5.10),
which satises the following gradient bounds:
          u (x + Œª e, t) ‚àí u (x, t)

                                                                                             (5.5.24)
and which grows at most linearly in time, i.e there exists a nite S > 0 such that
                   0 ‚â§ f (x) ‚àí u (x, t) ‚â§ St    for every x ‚àà R2 , t ‚â• 0.                   (5.5.25)

Moreover, u coincides with u, the unique viscosity solution of            (5.2.17).
    The proof of this Proposition is postponed to the Appendix. Since any limiting
function H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; f, W ) satises (5.5.24) (by taking the limit in the gradient bounds (5.2.4)
(5.2.5) and (5.2.6) satised by discrete height functions) and (5.5.25) (by taking the limit
in (5.4.7) and by monotonicity w.r.t time), we deduce the following Corollary.
Corollary 5.5.9. For almost every W and for any limit H‚àû as in Proposition 5.4.4
we have that for every f ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, (x, t) ‚Üí H‚àû (x, t; f, W ) is the unique viscosity solution of
(5.2.17).
   To complete the proof of Theorem 5.2.5 it is sucient to put together what we have
obtained so far.

Proof of Theorem 5.2.5.   Let us x W in an event of probability one such that Proposition
5.4.4 and Corollaries 5.3.4 and 5.5.9 hold simultaneously. Let f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM . By the discussion
in Section 5.4.1, without loss of generality, we can replace the sequence of initial height
proles hL approaching f as in Theorem 5.2.5 by hfL . Assume that for some T, R > 0,
the limit (5.2.16) does not hold, i.e, there exists Œµ > 0 and a subsequence (Lk )k‚ààN such
that
                    ‚àÄk ‚àà N,     sup      |HLk (x, t; f, W ) ‚àí u(x, t)| ‚â• Œµ,        (5.5.26)
                               x ‚â§R,t‚àà[0,T ]

where u is the unique viscosity solution of (5.2.17). Then, by Proposition 5.4.4, we can
extract a sub-subsequence (Lkm )m‚ààN such that for all g ‚àà ŒìÃÑ, the sequence of rescaled
height functions (HLkm (¬∑, ¬∑; g, W ))m‚ààN converges uniformly on all compact sets to some
continuous function H‚àû (¬∑, ¬∑; g, W ). By Corollary 5.5.9, (x, t) ‚Üí H‚àû (x, t; f, W ) has to be
equal to u. This is in contradiction with (5.5.26).


5.A Proof of Proposition 5.5.8
The proof relies on an adaptation of a standard doubling of variables argument (see
e.g [Bar13, p.64-72]).
    Let u be a continuous function initially equal to f ‚àà ŒìÃÑM for some integer M and
which is a solution in the sense of Eq. (5.5.10) satisfying (5.5.24) and (5.5.25). Let u be
the unique viscosity solution of (5.2.17). As explained in Remark 5.2.7, u(¬∑, t) stays in

ŒìÃÑM for all t so in particular, it satises (5.5.24) and by the comparison principle (and
since v is positive on TM ), it satises (5.5.25) with SM := maxœÅ‚ààTM v(œÅ).
    Let us start by showing that u ‚â§ u . Suppose the contrary i.e u(x, t) > u (x, t)
for some x, t. Therefore, we can x T ‚â• t and arbitrary small Œ∑, Œ≤ > 0 such that the
supremum

                   M :=         sup         (u(x, t) ‚àí u (x, t) ‚àí Œ∑ t ‚àí 2Œ≤ x2 )          (5.A.1)
                           x,t‚ààR2 √ó[0,T ]

is positive. Now, we introduce the function

                                                          x ‚àí y2 |t ‚àí s|2

                                                             Œµ2       Œ±2
where Œµ, Œ± are penalisation parameters that make the supremum of œà looks like M for
small Œµ, Œ±.

Lemma 5.A.1. Let us x positive    T, Œ∑, Œ≤ such that M > 0. For any Œµ, Œ± ‚àà [0, 1], œà
attains its maximum MÃÑ on a point (xÃÑ, tÃÑ, yÃÑ, sÃÑ) ‚àà R2 √ó [0, T ] √ó R2 √ó [0, T ]. Moreover,

function dened on R2 √ó [0, T ] by

                                      (x, t) ‚Üí u(x, t) ‚àí œï(1) (x, t)

has a local maximum at (xÃÑ, tÃÑ) where

                                            x ‚àí yÃÑ2 |t ‚àí sÃÑ|2
             œï(1) (x, t) := u (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) +            +          + Œ∑ t + Œ≤(x2 +yÃÑ2 ).
                                               Œµ2        Œ±2
   Therefore, since u is solution of viscosity of (5.2.17), and by point (4) of Lemma
5.A.1, we have for all Œµ, Œ± small enough,

                                 ‚àÇt œï(1) (xÃÑ, tÃÑ) + v(‚àáœï(1) (xÃÑ, tÃÑ)) ‚â§ 0.                  (5.A.2)

Remark     5.A.2. To be precise, we need to ensure that the viscosity inequality satised by
u is still valid if the local optimum on R2 √ó [0, T ] is attained at the border tÃÑ = T . This
is proven for example in [Bar13, Lemma 5.1] and the same proof can be easily adapted
to the case of u .

   Now, the function dened on R2 √ó [0, T ] by

                                  (y, s) ‚Üí u (y, s) ‚àí œï(2) (y, s)

has a local minimum at (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) where

            œï(2) (y, s) := u(xÃÑ, tÃÑ) ‚àí            ‚àí          ‚àí Œ∑ tÃÑ ‚àí Œ≤(xÃÑ2 +y2 ).
                                             Œµ2        Œ±2
In order to use the viscosity inequality (5.5.10) satised by u , we rst have to make sure
that ‚àáœï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) ‚àà T. From (5.5.24) and since u ‚àí œï(2) has a local minimum at (yÃÑ, sÃÑ), it
is easy to see that ‚àáœï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) is necessarily in the closure of T. We still have to make
sure that it stays away from the diagonal {œÅ1 + œÅ2 = 1}.
    The idea is to show that ‚àáœï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) is close to ‚àáœï(1) (xÃÑ, tÃÑ) which is in TM (because
u(¬∑, t) ‚àà ŒìÃÑM for all t as said in Remark 5.2.7 and because u ‚àí œï(1) has a local maximum
at (xÃÑ, tÃÑ)). By computing the gradients, we nd that

                    ‚àáœï(1) (xÃÑ, tÃÑ) ‚àí ‚àáœï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ)= 2Œ≤ xÃÑ ‚àí yÃÑ ‚â§ 4     CŒ≤           (5.A.3)
where the last inequality is due to point (2) of Lemma 5.A.1. This shows that if Œ≤ is
chosen small enough, we have that for all Œµ, Œ± small enough,

                                    ‚àáœï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) ‚àà TM +1 ‚äÜ T.                          (5.A.4)

Therefore, by (5.5.10),

                               ‚àÇs œï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) + v(‚àáœï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ)) ‚â• 0.                 (5.A.5)

   Combining (5.A.2) and (5.A.5), we get that for all Œµ, Œ± small enough,

                           Œ∑ + v(‚àáœï(1) (xÃÑ, tÃÑ)) ‚àí v(‚àáœï(2) (yÃÑ, sÃÑ)) ‚â§ 0.                (5.A.6)

Finally, as noticed in Remark 5.2.4, v is Lipschitz on TM +1 . Therefore, there exists a
constant K > 0 such that for all Œµ, Œ± small enough,
                                           
                                           

because of (5.A.3). By (5.A.6), we get that

                                          Œ∑ ‚àí 4K    CŒ≤ ‚â§ 0

which is a contradiction for Œ≤ small, since Œ∑ is strictly positive and C, K are independent
of Œ∑, Œ≤ . We conclude that u ‚â§ u on R2 √ó R+ .
    Although u and u don't play symmetric roles, we omit the proof that u ‚â§ u on
  2
R √ó R+ since it is very similar.

Proof of Lemma 5.A.1.     Let us rst show that the maximum of œà is attained. We have
for all x, y ‚àà R2 and all t, s ‚àà [0, T ],

        u(x, t) ‚àí u (y, s) ‚â§ |u(x, t) ‚àí u(y, t)|+u(y, t) ‚àí u (y, s)
                                                                                                   (5.A.7)
                            ‚â§ x ‚àí y+u(y, 0) + S T ‚àí u (y, 0) = x ‚àí y+S T

where in the second inequality we used that u satises (5.5.24) hence is 1-Lipschitz and is
non-increasing w.r.t time and that u satises (5.5.25). We also used u(y, 0) = u (y, 0) =
f (y) in the last step. As a consequence,

                           œà(x, t, y, s) ‚â§ x ‚àí y+ST ‚àí Œ≤ (x2 +y2 )

which tends to ‚àí‚àû when x, y‚Üí +‚àû. By continuity of œà , its maximum is attained
at some (xÃÑ, tÃÑ, yÃÑ, sÃÑ). Now, for any x, t,

                 œà(xÃÑ, tÃÑ, yÃÑ, sÃÑ) ‚â• œà(x, t, x, t) = u(x, t) ‚àí u (x, t) ‚àí Œ∑t ‚àí 2Œ≤x2 ,

which shows the rst point of Lemma 5.A.1 by taking the supremum with respect to x, t.

                                            by (5.A.7)                        xÃÑ ‚àí yÃÑ2             C

where the last inequality hold for all Œµ ‚â§ 1. This shows point (2).
    From point (2), we know that for xed Œ≤ and for any Œµ, Œ± ‚àà [0, 1], (xÃÑ, tÃÑ), (yÃÑ, sÃÑ) stay in
a compact set so, modulo sub-sequences, we can assume that they converge to the same
point (x0 , t0 ) as Œ±, Œµ ‚Üí 0, since xÃÑ ‚àí yÃÑ and |tÃÑ ‚àí sÃÑ| tend to 0. By continuity of u and u ,
we have

which proves point (3).
    Finally, if (x0 , t0 ) is a common limit point of (xÃÑ, tÃÑ), (yÃÑ, sÃÑ), then u(x0 , t0 ) ‚àí u (x0 , t0 ) ‚àí
Œ∑ t0 ‚àí 2Œ≤ x0 2 = M by the previous inequality and thus t0 = 0 otherwise we would have
M ‚â§ 0 (since u(x0 , 0) = u (x0 , 0)) which is a contradiction. This proves point (4).


Chapter 6
A new bijection between the
Gates-Westcott model and a
continuous version of the
Borodin-Ferrari dynamic
In this Chapter, we show that the Gates-Westcott model is in bijection with a continuous
limit of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic under a space-time rotation of the coordinates   (x, t)
and of the boundary condition (the initial condition at   t = 0 for the BF dynamic becomes
a boundary condition at   t=x    for the GW model). Such correspondence was already
well known for their one-dimensional analogue, i.e the Polynuclear Growth model and
the Hammersley process.

   In the literature, some connections were also made between the domino shuing
algorithm for the Aztec diamond and a family of line ensembles [Joh00a] that can be
interpreted as the level lines of a discrete space and time version of the Gates-Westcott
model started from a "droplet" type initial condition [PS02]. This was used e.g in [JPS98]
to show the Arctic circle theorem by mapping it with the hydrodynamic limit of the
discrete TASEP with parallel updates (which is also equivalent to the discrete PNG
i.e the rst line of the discrete GW model). Moreover, in [BF15], Borodin and Ferrari
explained the correspondence between the dynamic of the Aztec diamond and the discrete
time interlaced particle dynamic they introduced in [BF14] which implies a connection
between discrete Gates-Westcott and Borodin-Ferrari dynamics, in a discrete space-time
setting (with parallel updates) and started from the droplet/triangular initial condition.
In contrast, the bijection we show in this chapter follows a dierent approach that works
for general initial/boundary conditions (not only in the droplet or triangular setting) and
is given in a continuous time and space (only for the rst coordinate) setting.

   In Section 6.1, we rst remind the bijection between the PNG and the Hammersley
process. Then, in Section 6.2, we give a construction of the Gates-Westcott model with

6.1. BIJECTION BETWEEN THE PNG AND HAMMERSLEY DYNAMIC                                                            125

dened in (6.1.4)). Notice that for particular choices of h(y, 0), we recover the PNG in
the classical geometries:

   ¬à if h(y, 0) = 0, we recover the PNG staring from the Flat initial condition

   ¬à if h(y, 0) = ‚àí‚àû for y = 0 and h(0, 0) = 0, we get the PNG Droplet.

A generalised boundary condition
In what precedes we have the freedom to x the height on the line t = 0 and the height
function was dened on the upper-half space t ‚â• 0. We are going to extend the model
by introducing a more general boundary condition. We start by dening a space time
domain on which the height function is dened. The border of the domain is given by the
graph of a 1-Lipschitz function Œ≥ dened from R to R and which satises the following
property:
                                  lim Œ≥(x) + |x|= +‚àû.                            (6.1.2)
                                      x‚Üí¬±‚àû

The height function will be dened on the domain

                                 DŒ≥ := {(x, t) ‚àà R2 , t ‚â• Œ≥(x)}.                                              (6.1.3)

Notice that because of condition (6.1.2), the intersection of ‚àÇDŒ≥ (which is equal to the
graph of Œ≥ ) with the backward light-cone of any point in DŒ≥ is a compact curve where
the backward light cone of a point (x, t) is dened by

                         C ‚àí (x, t) := {(x , t ) ‚àà R2 , |x ‚àí x|‚â§ t ‚àí t }.                                 (6.1.4)

Remark  6.1.1. As we will see later, we can dispense from condition (6.1.2) but then
we have to impose a condition on the boundary condition to compensate the loss of
compactness of C ‚àí (x, t) ‚à© ‚àÇDŒ≥ . For instance, in order to recover the Hammersley process
one needs to choose Œ≥(x) = x and impose (6.1.12).
   Now, we need to x a boundary condition i.e set the height value on ‚àÇDŒ≥ . We let
hŒ≥ be any function from ‚àÇDŒ≥ into Z with locally nite ¬±1 jumps and with the following
compatibility condition :

        hŒ≥ (x , t ) ‚â§ hŒ≥ (x, t) if (x , t ) ‚àà C ‚àí (x, t) ‚à© ‚àÇDŒ≥ and (x, t) ‚àà ‚àÇDŒ≥ .                         (6.1.5)

Remark  6.1.2. Notice that a couple ((x, t), (x , t )) as in (6.1.5) can exist only on a line
segment on which Œ≥ has slope ¬±1.

Denition 6.1.3.   For any boundary curve Œ≥ and any boundary condition hŒ≥ satisfying
the assumptions above and for any realisation of a Poisson Point Process œâ on DŒ≥ (of
intensity 2), we dene the random height function given by the following variational
formula

   ‚àÄ(x, t) ‚àà DŒ≥ ,   h(x, t) :=            sup                 {hŒ≥ (x , t ) + L‚Üë (œâ ‚à© R(x ,t ),(x,t) )}.   (6.1.6)

where f is any continuous function on R. Therefore, from Proposition 6.1.5, the PNG
with asymmetric speed given by (6.1.10) has a hydrodynamic limit with a macroscopic
prole that is the unique viscosity solution of (6.1.11).

6.1.4    Bijection with the Hammersley process
Now we investigate the case where the boundary is a line with angle Œ± = œÄ/4 i.e Œ≥(x) = x
(the case Œ± = ‚àíœÄ/4 is analogous). This is an important case since it corresponds to the
Hammersley process dened in Chapter 2. In this case, condition (6.1.2) is no more
satised at ‚àí‚àû and the domain C ‚àí (x, t) ‚à© ‚àÇDŒ≥ appearing in the variational formula
(6.1.6) becomes unbounded. If we want the supremum in (6.1.6) to remain nite, we
need to impose the following decay on the boundary condition:

                                |x|‚àí1/2 h(x, x) ‚àí‚Üí ‚àí ‚àû.                              (6.1.12)
                                               x‚Üí‚àí‚àû

With condition (6.1.12), for all x ‚â• t, the supremum in (6.1.6) is almost surely attained
(since L‚Üë (œâ ‚à© R(x ,x ),(x,t) ) = O( |x |) when x goes to ‚àí‚àû) and thus the model is well
dened.
Remark   6.1.6. Notice that condition (6.1.12) is the same as the condition on the asymp-
totic density of particles as in (2.1.1).
    When we rotate the model by œÄ/4 clockwise, the level lines correspond to the graphical
construction of the Hammersley process i.e the trajectories of the particles lying on
the line R as in Chapter 2 and on Figure 6.4. In term of height process, the particle
trajectories coincide with the level lines of the height function dened in Section 2.1.2.
It corresponds also to the limit of the PNG with asymmetric speed described in the
previous section where the speed of kinks is +‚àû and the speed of antikinks is 0. This
means that as soon a new terrace is randomly created, it immediately extends rightwards
up to the next terrace on its right.
    Moreover, the Hamiltonian in (6.1.11) tends to 2/‚àÇx u when Œ± tends to œÄ/4. There-
fore, in the canonical basis rotated by œÄ/4, the Hydrodynamic limit of the Hammersley
process (with height function chosen as in Section 2.1.2) will be given by the following
Hamilton-Jacobi equation:
                               ‚éß

x -axis, ‚àÇx u is always non-negative. However, one needs to be careful to either give a

condition for the GW model in Section 6.2.1 before explaining the bijection between
the two models of interest in Section 6.2. Finally, we explore some applications of this
bijection in Section 6.3.

6.2.1    The GW model with general boundary conditions
In this section we give an abstract graphical construction of the Gates-Westcott model
with a generalised boundary condition. Later on, we will explain how the Gates-Westcott
and continuous Borodin-Ferrari dynamics can be recovered from the model.

The boundary condition
As in Section 6.1, we introduce a boundary curve Œ≥ which is a 1-Lipschitz function from
R to R and we dene the domain by the product

                         DŒ≥Z = {(x, y, t) ‚àà R √ó Z √ó R, t ‚â• Œ≥(x)},                   (6.2.1)

where DŒ≥ is dened in (6.1.3). We also need to x a boundary condition i.e the height
value on ‚àÇDŒ≥Z .

Denition 6.2.1. For any 1-Lipschitz function Œ≥ : R ‚Üí R, we dene the set of admissible
boundary conditions ŒìŒ≥ by the set of all functions hŒ≥ : ‚àÇDŒ≥Z ‚Üí Z satisfying the following
conditions:

  1. for all y ‚àà Z, the function x ‚Üí hŒ≥ (x, y, Œ≥(x)) a right-continuous step function with
     locally nite ¬±1 jumps and satises that for all (x, y) ‚àà R √ó Z,

                          hŒ≥ (x, y + 1, Œ≥(x)) ‚àí hŒ≥ (x, y, Œ≥(x)) ‚àà {0, ‚àí1},          (6.2.2)

  2. hŒ≥ satises a compatibility condition as in (6.1.5): for all y ‚àà Z and x, x ‚àà R,

              hŒ≥ (x, y, Œ≥(x)) ‚â§ hŒ≥ (x , y, Œ≥(x )) if Œ≥(x) = Œ≥(x ) ‚àí |x ‚àí x|,    (6.2.3)

  3. If limx‚Üí¬±‚àû Œ≥(x) + |x|= +‚àû, then hŒ≥ satises a decay condition at innity:

                                                                                (6.2.4)

          ‚é™                                          h   (x, y, Œ≥(x))

          ‚é© lim Œ≥(x) + x = +‚àû or ‚àÄy ‚àà Z, lim
                                                       Œ≥
                                                            ‚àö         = ‚àí‚àû.
            x‚Üí+‚àû                              x‚Üí+‚àû            x

Remark 6.2.2. As we will se later in Section 6.2.3 , the continuous version of the Borodin-
Ferrari dynamic corresponds to the case Œ≥(x) = x and thus only the decay condition at
‚àí‚àû in (6.2.4) is necessary in that case.


6.2. THE BIJECTION BETWEEN GW AND BF MODELS                                                        131

The graphical construction
We are going to dene the height function on DŒ≥Z . Let us keep in mind that the Gates-
Westcott model can be seen as a discrete family of PNG model indexed by Z with
interactions i.e for all y ‚àà Z, the process (x, t) ‚Üí h(x, y, t) follows the PNG dynamic
with creations allowed only if the following slope constraint is preserved:

                     ‚àÄ(x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥Z ,   h(x, y + 1, t) ‚àí h(x, y, t) ‚àà {0, ‚àí1}.                (6.2.5)

Therefore, in order to be consistent with the Gates-Westcott model, for each y ‚àà Z, we
want (x, t) ‚Üí h(x, y, t) to follow the PNG dynamic with generalised boundary condition
dened in Section 6.1 and with a subset of creations œâÃÉ ‚äÜ œâ that consists in Poisson
rings at which a height transition is possible without violating (6.2.5). This set œâÃÉ will
be called the set of "accepted" creations. Once œâÃÉ is dened, we can dene the height
function h(x, y, t) with the same variational formula as in (6.1.6) but with œâ replaced by
the restriction of œâÃÉ to the plane R √ó {y} √ó R (see (6.2.10)).
    Determining the subset œâÃÉ of allowed creations may be tricky when there are innitely
many Poisson points. First of all, we are going to dene the height function h when œâ is
an almost surely nite subset of R √ó Z √ó R (e.g a Poisson point process intersected with
a ball of radius Q ‚â• 0) by dening a recursive procedure to check one by one whether
the creation is accepted or not and thus dening œâÃÉ . Then, we will take the monotone
limit when the number of points tends to innity (e.g when Q goes to innity).
    Let us assume that œâ is a xed nite set of points in R √ó Z √ó R. In order to dene œâÃÉ ,
the subset of allowed creations in œâ , we need to dene in which order we are going to treat
these points. Intuitively, by nite speed of lateral expansion of the GW model (along
direction x), the height at (x, y, t) can be inuenced only by the creations (x , y  , t ) such
that (x , t ) ‚àà C ‚àí (x, t), the backward light cone of (x, t) as dened in (6.1.4). Therefore, if
(x, y, t) ‚àà œâ , all the Poisson points (x , y  , t ) ‚àà œâ with (x , t ) ‚àà C ‚àí (x, t) must be treated
before (x, y, t). This leads to the following denition (see also Figure 6.5).

Denition 6.2.3 (Consistent orderings). Let œâ be a nite set of points in R √ó Z √ó R.
We say that ((xi , yi , ti ))i‚àà1,n is a consistent ordering of œâ if {(xi , yi , ti ), i ‚àà 1, n} = œâ
and if for all i, j ‚àà 1, n,

                                   (xi , ti ) ‚àà C ‚àí (xj , tj ) ‚áí i ‚â§ j                          (6.2.6)

Remark 6.2.4. Consistent orderings of œâ always exist as long as œâ doesn't contain two
points which share the same coordinates x and t (this is almost surely true for Poisson
point process restricted to a bounded domain which is enough for our purposes). For
instance, ordering points w.r.t their time coordinate t is a consistent ordering (this is
the natural ordering chosen to dene the Gates-Westcott dynamic in [Ler20]). Ordering
them with respect to t ‚àí x is also a consistent ordering that will be useful to recover the
construction of the continuous limit of BF dynamic later on.
   Now, assume that we have xed a 1-Lipschitz boundary curve Œ≥ together with a
boundary condition hŒ≥ ‚àà ŒìŒ≥ as in Denition 6.2.1 and a nite set of points œâ . Consider


132       CHAPTER 6. A NEW BIJECTION BETWEEN THE GW AND BF MODELS
any consistent ordering ((xi , yi , ti ))1‚â§i‚â§n of œâ‚à©{(x, y, t), t > Œ≥(x)}. We are going to dene
œâÃÉ and h recursively by dening a sequence œâÃÉ 0 ‚Üí h0 ‚Üí œâÃÉ 1 ‚Üí ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ ‚Üí hn‚àí1 ‚Üí œâÃÉ n ‚Üí hn
where œâÃÉ k has to be thought of as the subset of accepted creations among ((xi , yi , ti ))i‚àà1,k
and hk as the height function following the Gates-Westcott dynamic with boundary
condition hŒ≥ and with creations restricted to œâÃÉ k . In the end, when all points in œâ have
been treated, one gets œâÃÉ := œâÃÉ n and h := hn .
    Initially, no creations have been accepted yet so we set for all (x, y, t) in DŒ≥Z ,

                       œâÃÉ 0 = ‚àÖ and h0 (x, y, t) =                        sup                 {hŒ≥ (x , y, t )}.    (6.2.7)
                                                                 (x ,t )‚ààC ‚àí (x,t)‚à©‚àÇD   Œ≥



If œâÃÉ k‚àí1 and hk‚àí1 are already dened for some k ‚àà 1, n then we set
            ‚éß                                     
            ‚é™

                           ‚à™ (xk , yk , tk ) if
   œâÃÉ k =                                             hk‚àí1 (xk , yk , tk ) ‚àí hk‚àí1 (xk , yk ‚àí 1, tk ) = ‚àí1            (6.2.8)

Equation (6.2.8) is the condition for the creation (xk , yk , tk ) to be accepted and lead to a
height increase of 1 without breaking the slope constraint (6.2.5) along y . Now we dene
for all (x, y, t) in DŒ≥Z

          hk (x, y, t) :=                sup              {hŒ≥ (x , y, t ) + L‚Üë (œâÃÉyk ‚à© R(x ,t ),(x,t) )},        (6.2.9)
                                (x ,t )‚ààC ‚àí (x,t)‚à©‚àÇDŒ≥


where œâÃÉyk := œâÃÉ k ‚à© (R √ó {y} √ó R) is identied with a subset of R2 with some abuse of
notation. By induction, we obtain a sequence (œâÃÉ i , hi )0‚â§i‚â§n and we dene nally œâÃÉ = œâÃÉ n
and h = hn . By construction, we have for all (x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥Z ,

          h(x, y, t) :=                 sup              {hŒ≥ (x , y, t ) + L‚Üë (œâÃÉy ‚à© R(x ,t ),(x,t) )},         (6.2.10)
                               (x ,t )‚ààC ‚àí (x,t)‚à©‚àÇDŒ≥


where œâÃÉy := œâÃÉ ‚à© (R √ó {y} √ó R) is identied with a subset of R2 .
Remark      6.2.5. The compatibility condition (6.2.3) ensures that h and hŒ≥ coincide on
‚àÇDŒ≥Z .
Remark 6.2.6. Notice that (hi )0‚â§i‚â§n is a non-decreasing sequence of functions and (œâÃÉi )0‚â§i‚â§n
is a non-decreasing sequence of sets. Moreover, hk (x, y, t) is constant for all k ‚â• k0 (x, t)
where k0 (x, t) = max{i ‚àà 1, n, (xi , ti ) ‚àà C ‚àí (x, t)} (or 0 if this set is empty).

Lemma 6.2.7. When                 œâ is nite, the construction of œâÃÉ and h dened recursively by
(6.2.8)   and    (6.2.9)      does not depend on the choice of the consistent ordering of œâ.
    Lemma 6.2.7, whose proof is postponed to the end of the section, allows us to dene
the height function unambiguously on DŒ≥Z as follows.

Denition 6.2.8. Let us x a 1-Lipschitz function Œ≥ and a boundary condition hŒ≥ ‚àà ŒìŒ≥
as in Denition 6.2.1. For almost all realisation œâ of a Poisson point process of intensity
2 on R √ó Z √ó R, we dene for all (x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥Z ,

                               h(x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ) := lim h(x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ Q ),                                 (6.2.11)
                                                              Q‚Üí+‚àû


where h(x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ Q ) is the height function dened in (6.2.10) with the nite set of
points œâ Q := œâ ‚à© B(0, Q).

    Let us explain briey why the limit (6.2.11) exists and is nite. As we will see in
Proposition 6.2.10, h(x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ Q ) is non-decreasing with respect to Q so the limit
exists. Moreover, for all xed y ‚àà Z, since œâÃÉyQ ‚äÜ œây := œâ ‚à© (R √ó {y} √ó R) for all Q > 0,
we have

     h(x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ Q ) ‚â§            sup                 {hŒ≥ (x , y, t ) + L‚Üë (œây ‚à© R(x ,t ),(x,t) )}.   (6.2.12)
                               (x ,t )‚ààC ‚àí (x,t)‚à©‚àÇD   Œ≥



If limx‚Üí¬±‚àû Œ≥(x) + |x|= +‚àû, then C ‚àí (x, t) ‚à© ‚àÇDŒ≥ is a compact set and thus the r.h.s in
(6.2.12) is nite. Otherwise, since hŒ≥ satises the decay condition (6.2.4) and since

                          L‚Üë (œây ‚à© R(x ,Œ≥(x )),(x,t) ) =              O (       |x |),   a.s,
                                                                     |x |‚Üí‚àû


the r.h.s in (6.2.12) is also nite. In any case, we deduce that the limit in (6.2.11) is
nite.

Proof of Lemma 6.2.7. Let (xi , yi , ti )1‚â§i‚â§n and (xœÉ(i) , yœÉ(i) , tœÉ(i) )1‚â§i‚â§n be two consistent
orderings of œâ ‚à© {(x, y, t), t > Œ≥(x)}, where œÉ is a permutation of 1, n. We note
(œâÃÉ i , hi )0‚â§i‚â§n and (œâÃÉœÉi , hiœÉ )0‚â§i‚â§n the sequence of accepted creations and heights for these
two respective consistent orderings. It is sucient to prove that œâÃÉ n = œâÃÉœÉn . Let us
also dene for all k ‚àà 0, n, œâ k := {(xi , yi , ti ) ‚àà œâ, i ‚â§ k} and similarly œâœÉk :=
{((xœÉ(i) , yœÉ(i) , tœÉ(i) ) ‚àà œâ, i ‚â§ k} which correspond to the points that have been treated
up to step k . It is enough to show the following property by induction for all k ‚àà 0, n:

        P(k) :     If (x, y, t) ‚àà œâ k ‚à© œâœÉk ,           then (x, y, t) ‚àà œâÃÉ k ‚áî (x, y, t) ‚àà œâÃÉœÉk .              (6.2.13)

In words, among all points that have been treated for both consistent ordering up to step
k , the same have been accepted. Property P(0) is trivial. Assume P(k ‚àí 1) for some
k ‚àà 1, n and let (x, y, t) ‚àà œâ k ‚à© œâœÉk . There exist i, j ‚â§ k such that (x, y, t) = (xi , yi , ti ) =
(xœÉ(j) , yœÉ(j) , tœÉ(j) ). By (6.2.8), it is enough to show that hi‚àí1 (x, ¬∑, t) = hj‚àí1         œÉ (x, ¬∑, t). By
                                                                                         
(6.2.9), it suces to show that for any xed (x , y , t ) ‚àà œâ such that (x , t ) ‚àà C ‚àí (x, t) \
{(x, t)}, we have that (x , y  , t ) ‚àà œâÃÉ i‚àí1 if and only if (x , y  , t ) ‚àà œâÃÉœÉj‚àí1 . But by denition
of consistent ordering, since (x , t ) ‚àà C ‚àí (x, t) \ {(x, t)} and (x, y, t) ‚àà œâ i ‚à© œâœÉj , we know
that (x , y  , t ) necessarily belongs to œâ i‚àí1 ‚à© œâœÉj‚àí1 and the proof is concluded by applying
P(k ‚àí 1).

h 0 (x1 , y1 , t1 ) where h0 and h 0 are as in (6.2.7). Finally, in the case where (x1 , y1 , t1 ) ‚àà œâ
and h0 (x1 , y1 , t1 ) = h 0 (x1 , y1 , t1 ), since h0 (x1 , y1 ¬± 1, t1 ) ‚â§ h 0 (x1 , y1 ¬± 1, t1 ) we have by
construction (see (6.2.8)) that if (x1 , y1 , t1 ) ‚àà œâÃÉ 1 , then (x1 , y1 , t1 ) ‚àà œâÃÉ 1 . In all cases, we
proved (6.2.16). Let hŒ≥  and hŒ≥  be the restrictions of h(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; hŒ≥ , œâ) and h(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; hŒ≥ , œâ  ) to
‚àÇDŒ≥Z where Œ≥  is dened as the superior envelope of Œ≥ and C ‚àí (x1 , t1 ). Inequality (6.2.16)
implies that hŒ≥  ‚â§ hŒ≥  . But now, the intersection of œâ  with the interior of DŒ≥Z has N
points. This concludes the proof by induction and modulo showing Proposition 6.2.11
for nite œâ .

Proposition 6.2.11 (Markov Property). Let œâ be a nite set or a realisation of a Poisson
point process on R √ó Z √ó R. Let Œ≥ and Œ≥  be two 1-Lipschitz curves with Œ≥  (x) ‚â• Œ≥(x) for
all x ‚àà R and hŒ≥ ‚àà ŒìŒ≥ . For all (x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥Z ,
                                             h(x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ) = h(x, y, t; hŒ≥  , œâ),                                    (6.2.17)
where hŒ≥  is the restriction of h(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; hŒ≥ , œâ) to ‚àÇDŒ≥Z .
Proof. Let us start by proving Proposition 6.2.11 when œâ is a nite subset of {(x, y, t), t >
Œ≥(x)}. First of all, let us remark that, by construction, hŒ≥  is in ŒìŒ≥  so the r.h.s of (6.2.17)
is well dened. Since Œ≥ ‚â§ Œ≥  and since they are both 1-Lipschiz functions, one can
always nd a consistent ordering (xi , yi , ti )1‚â§i‚â§n+n of œâ such that (xi , yi , ti )n+1‚â§i‚â§n+n
is a consistent ordering of œâ . Let (hi , œâÃÉ i )0‚â§i‚â§n+n and (h i , œâÃÉ i )0‚â§i‚â§n ) be the sequences
obtained when dening h(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; hŒ≥ , œâ) and h(¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; hŒ≥  , œâ) recursively by (6.2.8) and (6.2.9).
We are going to show by induction that for all k ‚àà 0, n ,
                                       œâÃÉ k = œâÃÉ n+k \ œâÃÉ n                                                               (6.2.18)

                         h (x, y, t) = hn+k (x, y, t),                ‚àÄy ‚àà Z, ‚àÄx, t ‚àà R, t ‚â• Œ≥  (x).                      (6.2.19)
Since (6.2.18) is trivial for k = 0 and since if (6.2.19) holds for some k , then (6.2.18)
holds for k + 1 (by (6.2.8)), it suces to show that (6.2.18) implies (6.2.19). Now,
by Remark 6.2.6, since all the points below Œ≥  have been treated after step n (by the
choice of the consistent ordering), the height hn at step n coincides with the nal height

with equality for some (x , t ) ‚àà C ‚àí (x, t) (if we assume that (6.2.18) holds) to show the
third equality. By induction, this concludes the proof of Proposition 6.2.11 in the nite
case. The case where œâ is innite follows by taking the monotone limit as in (6.2.11).


136     CHAPTER 6. A NEW BIJECTION BETWEEN THE GW AND BF MODELS
6.2.2    Consistency with the Gates-Westcott model
In this section we explain why the graphical construction of Section 6.2.1 gives a alter-
native construction of the usual Gates-Westcott model if we x a boundary condition on
the line Œ≥ ‚â° 0. By construction, we can restrict the underlying Poisson point process to a
bounded domain and thus assume that it contains nitely many points. In addition, since
both models satisfy a Markov Property, it is enough to show that they agree up to the rst
time t1 > 0 such that (x1 , y1 , t1 ) is a Poisson point. Up to time t‚àí    1 , the Gates-Westcott
model evolves deterministically (by lateral expansion of speed 1 and annihilation) and
thus, for all t < t1 , hGW (x, y, t) = supz‚àà[x‚àít,x+t] {h(z, y, 0)} which is consistent with
(6.2.7). Moreover, creation (x1 , y1 , t1 ) is accepted for the Gates-Westcott model if and
only if hGW(x1 , y1 + 1, t‚àí1 ) ‚àí hGW(x1 , y1 , t‚àí1 ) = 0 and hGW(x1 , y1 , t‚àí1 ) ‚àí hGW(x1 , y1 ‚àí
    1 ) = ‚àí1 which holds if and only if condition (6.2.8) is satised (for k = 1) because
1, t‚àí
hGW (x1 , y, t‚àí
              1 ) = supz‚àà[x1 ‚àít1 ,x1 +t1 ] {h(z, y, 0)} if x1 ¬± t1 are not discontinuity points of
h(¬∑, ¬∑, 0) which is almost surely the case. Therefore, the graphical construction with Œ≥ ‚â° 0
is compatible with the Gates-Westcott model.
Remark 6.2.12. We let the interested reader check that, as in the one-dimensional case,
if we choose an angle Œ± ‚àà (‚àíœÄ/4, œÄ/4) and set a boundary condition on Œ≥Œ± (x) = tan(Œ±)x,
the straight line of angle Œ± w.r.t the x-axis, up to a rotation of coordinates x and t by Œ±,
we get a a construction of the Gates-Westcott model with asymmetric speed i.e the kinks
and antikinks move at dierent speeds given by (6.1.10) but the annihilation and random
nucleations mechanisms obey the same rules as the standard Gates-Westcott model.
6.2.3    Bijection with a continuous limit of Borodin-Ferrari dynamic
The goal of this section is to show how the GW model with boundary condition on
domain {(x, y, t), t = x} is in bijection with a continuous limit of the Borodin-Ferrari
dynamic that we dene rst. The main statement is written in Proposition 6.2.20.
A continuous limit of the BF dynamic
In the BF dynamic introduced in Chapter 2, the particles lie on the discrete lattice that
we call G which is isomorphic to Z2 and their jumps are determined by an underlying
Poisson point process on G √ó R+ of intensity 1. In the continuous limit, the particles lie
on the lattice R √ó Z (a discrete set of continuous straight lines) and the underlying point
process is now a Poisson point process of intensity 1 on R √ó Z √ó R+ .
     More precisely, the state space contains all interlaced particles conguration on R √ó Z
i.e the set of Œ∑ = (z(p,) )(p,)‚ààZ ‚àà RZ such that z(p,) < z(p,+1) < z(p+1,) , as in Figure
                                 2

label of the leftmost particle to the strict right of x on line  = y . Finally, the temporal
gradient hBF              BF
           Œ∑ (x, y, t ) ‚àí hŒ∑ (x, y, t) is dened by the number of particles on line  = y
that crossed x between times t and t .

Remark   6.2.15. Notice that, in addition to the dierent lattice, the height function cho-
sen here is dierent from that of [LT18] and that of Chapter 5 for the discrete-space
BF dynamic. Indeed, if we considered the height function of Chapters 5 and took the
continuous limit as described in Remark 6.2.13, we would get slopes (œÅx , œÅy ) which would
be equal to (1 ‚àí œÅx , ‚àíœÅy ) where (œÅx , œÅy ) are the slopes along x and y associated to the
height function of Denition 6.2.14. Moreover, the temporal gradients would be opposite
of each other.
   We let the reader check that the sum of gradients along any closed circuit is zero and
thus the height function hBF
                          Œ∑ is well dened. This leads to the following denitions.

Denition 6.2.16.   We dene ŒìBF as the set of admissible height functions for the
continuous Borodin-Ferrari dynamic by the set of functions hBF : R √ó Z ‚Üí Z such that

  1. for all y ‚àà Z, x ‚Üí hBF (x, y) is a non-decreasing right-continuous step function with
     +1 jumps and for all (x, y) ‚àà R √ó Z, hBF (x, y + 1) ‚àí hBF (x, y) ‚àà {0, ‚àí1},

  2. for all y ‚àà Z, limx‚Üí‚àí‚àû hBF (x, y)/     |x| = ‚àí‚àû.

Remark   6.2.17. As written in Denition 6.2.14, to each particle conguration, we can
associate a unique height function in ŒìBF up to a constant (corresponding e.g for the
height at 0). Conversely, for any height function in ŒìBF , there exists a unique particle
conguration associated to it. Notice that condition 2. is equivalent to (6.2.20).
Remark   6.2.18. Let us set Œ≥œÄ/4 : x ‚Üí x. It is straightforward to check that

                  ŒìŒ≥œÄ/4  hŒ≥œÄ/4 ‚Üí h0 : (x, y) ‚Üí hŒ≥œÄ/4 (x/2, y, x/2) ‚àà ŒìBF         (6.2.21)

is a bijection between the state space ŒìŒ≥œÄ/4 dened in Denition 6.2.1 and ŒìBF .

Denition 6.2.19. For all h0 ‚àà ŒìBF and all realisation œâ of a Poisson point process on
R √ó Z √ó R+ , we dene
                                     hBF (x, y, t; h0 , œâ)                          (6.2.22)

as the height function associated to the continuous BF dynamic starting from the unique
particle conguration associated to h0 and whose jumps are determined by œâ .

Bijection between GW and the continuous limit of BF
We are now ready to state the bijection between the Gates-Westcott model with boundary
condition on DŒ≥ZœÄ/4 = {(x, y, t) ‚àà R √ó Z √ó R, t = x} and the continuous version of the
Borodin-Ferrari dynamic (see Figure 6.8 for an illustration).


6.2. THE BIJECTION BETWEEN GW AND BF MODELS                                                                      139

Proposition 6.2.20. Fix any boundary condition hŒ≥       œÄ/4
                                                            ‚àà ŒìŒ≥œÄ/4 and note h0 ‚àà ŒìBF its
image under the bijection (6.2.21). For almost all realisation œâ of a Poisson point process
of intensity 2 on R √ó Z √ó R, for all t ‚â• x and all y ‚àà Z,
                             hGW (x, y, t; hŒ≥ , œâ) = hBF (x + t, y, t ‚àí x, h0 , œâ  ),                      (6.2.23)

where hGW is the height function of the Gates-Westcott model with generalised boundary
condition dened in Denition 6.2.8 and œâ = {(x + t, y, t ‚àí x), (x, y, t) ‚àà œâ}.
Remark  6.2.21. By the change of variables, the random point process œâ ‚Üí œâ  is a Poisson
point process of intensity 1 on R √ó Z √ó R.

Proof.   By construction of the two models, without loss of generality we can restrict œâ to
a bounded domain and thus consider that it contains nitely many points (the general
case is obtained by taking the innite cardinality limit). To any (x, t) ‚àà R2 , let us
associate the new coordinates (x , t ) = (x + t, t ‚àí x) and let (x1 , y1 , t1 ) be the point
among those in œâ with t ‚â• 0 with minimal t . Since both models satisfy a Markov
Property (see Proposition 6.2.11), it is enough to show that both sides of (6.2.23) agree
for all t ‚àà [0, t1 ].
    On the one hand, by minimality of t1 , we know that no particles attempt to jump
for the continuous BF dynamic before time t1 and thus hBF (¬∑, ¬∑, t ) = h0 , for all t ‚â§ t1 .
    On the other hand, by minimality of t1 , for any (x, y, t) such that 0 ‚â§ t < t1 , there
is no point in œâ whose rst and third coordinates lie in the backward light cone C ‚àí (x, t)
intersected with the epigraph of Œ≥œÄ/4 . Moreover, the intersection of this cone with the
graph of Œ≥œÄ/4 is the set {(z, z), 2z ‚â§ x }. Altogether, by the monotonicity of hŒ≥œÄ/4
induced by (6.2.3), we have that for all (x, y, t) such that 0 ‚â§ t < t1 the supremum in
(6.2.10) is attained at (x /2, y, x /2) and thus

  hGW (x, y, t; hŒ≥œÄ/4 , œâ) = hŒ≥œÄ/4 (x /2, y, x /2) = h0 (x , y) = hBF (x , y, t ; h0 , œâ  ).          (6.2.24)

     Now, we have to check that the creation (x1 , y1 , t1 ) is accepted for the Gates-Westcott
model if and only if the leftmost particle to the strict right of x1 on line  = y1 can jump
to position x1 at time t1 . Let (px1 , y1 ) be the label of this particle. By denition of the
dynamic, it can jump to x1 if and only if it is not blocked by particles (px1 ‚àí1, y1 +1) and
(px1 , y1 ‚àí1) i.e if and only if z(px ‚àí1,y1 +1) (t1 ‚àí ) < x and z(px ,y1 ‚àí1) (t1 ‚àí ) < x. By Denition
                                          1                                    1
6.2.14, this is equivalent to the condition hBF (x1 , y1 + 1, t1 ‚àí ) ‚àí hBF (x1 , y1 , t1 ‚àí ) = 0 and
hBF (x1 , y1 , t1 ‚àí ) ‚àí hBF (x1 , y1 ‚àí 1, t1 ‚àí ) = ‚àí1. By (6.2.24), this is the same condition1
as (6.2.8) (for k = 1). Consequently, creation (x1 , y1 , t1 ) is accepted if and only if the
particle can jump at time t1 .
    If none of these events happens, both height functions still satisfy (6.2.24) also at
time t1 and the proof is concluded.
    If both events happen, the heights remain unchanged for y = y1 at time t1 but they
grow on line y1 . Let us note z1 := z(px ,y1 ) (t‚àí    1 ) the position of the leftmost particle to the

144      CHAPTER 6. A NEW BIJECTION BETWEEN THE GW AND BF MODELS
6.3.2     Hydrodynamic limits for general boundary conditions
In this section, we use the result shown in Chapter 4 for the usual Gates-Westcott
model to deduce a hydrodynamic limit for the GW with general boundary condition and
thus for the continuous limit of the Borodin-Ferrari dynamic, thanks to the bijection
of Proposition 6.2.20. Although this result is the natural analogue of the hydrodynamic
limit shown in Chapter 5 for the discrete-space BF dynamic, it couldn't be easily deduced
from it due to non-trivial inversion of limits issues, as explained in Section 6.3.1. In other
words, the bijection yields a new hydrodynamic result for the continuous BF dynamic
with a proof that is dierent from that of its discrete-space analogue.
    We follow the notations of Section 6.2.1. For any 1-Lipschitz function Œ≥ : R ‚Üí R, we
dene the domain of R3 :
                                DŒ≥R := {(x, y, t) ‚àà R3 , t ‚â• Œ≥(x)}.                            (6.3.1)
Let also fŒ≥ : ‚àÇDŒ≥R ‚Üí R be any continuous function satisfying (6.2.3) for all y ‚àà R and
fŒ≥ (x, y  , Œ≥(x))‚àífŒ≥ (x, y, Œ≥(x)) ‚àà [‚àí(y  ‚àíy), 0], for all y < y  and all x ‚àà R. For any L ‚àà N,
let Œ≥ L = x ‚Üí LŒ≥(x/L) be the rescaled boundary curve and (hL              Œ≥ )L‚ààN be a sequence of
discrete height functions in ŒìŒ≥ L approaching fŒ≥ in the following sense:
                                                                            
                                1 L                                         

    Now we need to make assumptions on the boundary condition at innity. In what
follows, we will assume one of the following:

                                                              Œ≥ (Lx, Ly, LŒ≥(x))
(H2) :       lim Œ≥(x) + |x|= ‚àû        ‚áí       lim sup sup                         = ‚àí‚àû, ‚àÄy ‚àà R ,

and the same holds when x tends to +‚àû.

Note that assumption (H2) is more general than (H1).

exists a continuous function u : DŒ≥R ‚Üí R such that for almost all realisation œâ of a PPP

6.3. CONSEQUENCES OF THE BIJECTION AND PERSPECTIVES                                         145

Remark   6.3.2. If (H1) doesn't hold, uniqueness of the viscosity solution of (6.3.4) in
the general case of (H2) is a priori non trivial. However, uniqueness can be guaranteed
under stronger assumptions on the gradients of fŒ≥ as written the in Corollary 6.3.5 and
as explained in Remark 6.3.6.
    Before giving a proof of Theorem 6.3.1, let us formulate a few corollaries of Theorem
6.3.1.
    As observed in Remark 6.2.12, the GW model with boundary curve Œ≥Œ± (x) = tan(Œ±)x
for Œ± ‚àà (‚àíœÄ/4, œÄ/4) can be interpreted as the Gates-Westcott dynamic with asymmetric
kink/antikink speeds modulo a rotation of coordinates x and t by Œ±. Let hGW Œ± (¬∑, ¬∑, ¬∑; h, œâ)
be the height function following the GW dynamic with kink/antikink speeds given by
vk (Œ±) = tan(œÄ/4 + Œ±) and va (Œ±) = ‚àí tan(œÄ/4 ‚àí Œ±), whose height at time zero is given
by h and with realisation œâ of a PPP of intensity 2 on R √ó Z √ó R.

Corollary 6.3.3 (Hydrodynamic Limit for GW with asymmetric kink/antikink speeds).
Let f be any continuous prole in ŒìÃÑGW and let (hL )L‚ààN be any sequence of initial height
proles in ŒìGW (where ŒìGW and ŒìÃÑGW are dened e.g in Section 3.1). Assume that
                                                                 
                                          1 L                    
                   ‚àÄR > 0,          sup  h (Lx, Ly) ‚àí f (x, y) ‚àí‚Üí 0.

Then, we have for almost all realisation œâ,

Remark  6.3.4. Observe that the speed in (6.3.6) is obtained from the speed in (6.3.4) by
a change of coordinates corresponding to the rotation of (x, t) by Œ±.
   Likewise, by Proposition 6.2.20, we know that the case Œ± = œÄ/4 corresponds to the
continuous version of BF dynamic dened at the beginning of Section 6.2.3. Conse-

Remark    6.3.6. The uniform lower bound on height dierences along x for f and hL is
stronger than (H2) and is there to give a meaning to equation (6.3.8) (whose Hamiltonian
is ill-dened whenever ‚àÇx u = 0) and to guarantee uniqueness. Indeed, for the same
reasons explained in Remark 3.1.3 , with this lower bound, there exists a unique viscosity
solution of (6.3.8) whose gradients along x remain uniformly away from 0 at all time.
Remark 6.3.7. The Hamiltonian in (6.3.8) can be obtained as the limit when Œ± tends
                                                   ‚àö
to œÄ/4 of (6.3.6) (and modulo rescaling space by 2 for the same reason as in Remark
6.1.8). Besides, one can check that it is consistent with the Hamiltonian in (3.1.11) for
the discrete-space version of BF, after taking the continuous limit as in Remark 6.2.13.
To do so, one should take into account the dierent coordinates used in Theorem 3.1.2
and the dierent denition of height function as explained in Remark 6.2.15.

Proof of Theorem 6.3.1 with (H1).     We start by proving the Theorem assuming (H1)
which guarantees that the intersection of any backward light-cone C ‚àí (x, t) with the
graph of Œ≥ is compact. This somehow simplies the proof and will be crucial for showing
Proposition 6.3.9 that implies uniqueness of the solution of (6.3.4). At the end of the
proof, we will explain how we can proceed when we assume (H2) instead of (H1), without
giving many details for the sake of simplicity and conciseness.
    The strategy of the proof is the following. First of all, we show that any subsequence
of the rescaled height functions admits a subsubsequence that converges uniformly on
all compact sets of DŒ≥R . Then, thanks to Markov Property (Proposition 6.2.11), we
know that the height function behaves locally like the standard Gates-Westcott model
(as explained in Section 6.2.2). Therefore, by the Hydrodynamic Limit result for the
Gates-Westcott model shown in Chapter 4, we deduce that any limiting rescaled height
function is a viscosity solution of (6.3.4). Finally, we conclude by a uniqueness result on
such viscosity solution.
    Assume that (H1) is satised and that (hL Œ≥ )L‚ààN is a xed sequence of height converging
to a continuous function fŒ≥ as in Theorem 6.3.1. For simplicity, let us denote by hL the
rescaled space-time proles

Lemma 6.3.8. Almost surely, for any subsequence (Lk )k‚ààN , we can extract a subsubse-
quence (Lk )m‚ààN such that (hL )m‚ààN converges uniformly on all compact sets of DŒ≥R to
             m                              km

Proof. As explained in the proof of Lemma 5.4.5, it is enough to show that the following
holds almost surely:

  1.   Pointwise Boundedness :               for all xed (x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥R , the sequence (hL (x, y, t))L‚ààN
       is bounded.

  2.   Asymptotic equi-continuity                : for all xed (x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥R and all Œµ > 0, there exists
       Œ¥ > 0 such that

The rest of the proof follows from diagonal extraction, separability of DŒ≥R and complete-
ness of R (see Section 5.4.3).
     Essentially, Properties 1 and 2 are consequences of the denition (6.2.10) and Lemma
4.5.4 which states that there exists a constant c > 0 such that for almost all realistion of
œâ , for all light-rectangle R ‚äÜ R2 , and all Y > 0,

where Leb(R) is the area of R and œây is the restriction of œâ to R√ó{y}√óR. By assumption
(H1), for all (x, t) ‚àà DŒ≥ , the intersection C ‚àí (x, t) ‚à© ‚àÇDŒ≥ is bounded hence included in
some light-rectangle R0 ‚äÜ R2 . Therefore, by applying (6.3.12) to R0 , by (6.2.10) and by
(6.3.2), we get that

            lim sup hL (x, y, t) ‚â§                 sup                fŒ≥ (x , y, t ) + c   Leb(R0 ) < +‚àû.

The monotonicity w.r.t to t of the dynamic and (6.3.2) gives an easy lower bound for
hL (x, y, t) and this concludes pointwise boundedness.
    Now, let us show asymptotic equi-continuity (the proof is very similar to Proposition
4.5.6). By monotonicity w.r.t t + x and t ‚àí x and since the height function is 1-Lipschitz
along y , it is enough to show that lim supL‚Üí‚àû hL (x, y, t + Œ¥) ‚àí hL (x, y, t ‚àí Œ¥) tends to
zero when Œ¥ goes to zero. We are going to show that almost surely, for all (x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥R

Let us note C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ) := {(x, y, t) ‚àà R3 , (x, y) ‚àí (x0 , y0 )‚â§ t0 ‚àí t}, the backward
light cone of (x0 , y0 , t0 ) ‚àà DŒ≥R . Equation (6.3.17) is the key ingredient to show that
information propagates at speed 1 i.e the value of the solution at (x0 , y0 , t0 ) only depends
on the boundary condition in C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ) as written in the following Proposition.
Proposition 6.3.9.     Let u and v be respectively viscosity sub and super-solution of
(6.3.16) inside DŒ≥R . For any (x0 , y0 , t0 ) ‚àà DŒ≥R , if u ‚â§ v on ‚àÇDŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ), then
u ‚â§ v also in DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ).
Remark   6.3.10. In the case where Œ≥ ‚â° 0, we recover [Bar13, Theorem 5.3] i.e for any
R > 0, if u ‚â§ v on B(0, R), then u(x, t) ‚â§ v(x, t) for any t ‚â§ R and x in B(0, R ‚àí t).
    It is easy to see that Proposition 6.3.9 implies uniqueness of the viscosity solution of
(6.3.16) and thus concludes the proof of Theorem 6.3.1 when (H1) is true.

Proof of Proposition 6.3.9.   First of all, (6.3.17) implies that w := u ‚àí v is a sub-solution
of
                                 ‚àÇt w ‚àí ‚àáw= 0 inside DŒ≥R .                             (6.3.18)
The proof is easy and is done in [Bar13, Lemma 5.3] so we won't show it. It remains
to show that if w ‚â§ 0 on ‚àÇDŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ), then w ‚â§ 0 also in DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ).
Let M be the supremum of w on DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ) (which is nite and attained since
w is continuous and DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ) is compact by assumption (H1) ). Assume, by
contradiction, that M > 0 even though w ‚â§ 0 on ‚àÇDŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ).
    Now, following [Bar13], for all Œ¥ > 0, let œáŒ¥ : R ‚Üí R be any smooth increasing
function such that                       
                                           0       if r ‚â§ t0 ‚àí Œ¥

and
                 œïŒ¥ := (x, y, t) ‚Üí œáŒ¥ ((x ‚àí x0 , y ‚àí y0 )+t) + Œ¥ (t ‚àí tmin ),
where tmin := min{t, ‚àÉ(x, y, t) ‚àà DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 )} is such that œïŒ¥ ‚â• 0 on DŒ≥R ‚à©
C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ). It is easy to check that œïŒ¥ is a smooth strict super-solution of (6.3.18)


6.3. CONSEQUENCES OF THE BIJECTION AND PERSPECTIVES                                                    151

inside the domain DŒ¥ := DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ) ‚à© {t ‚â§ t0 ‚àí Œ¥}. Therefore, since w is a
sub-solution, the restriction of w ‚àí œïŒ¥ to DŒ¥ attains its maximum neither inside DŒ¥ nor
on {t = t0 ‚àí Œ¥} (by [Bar13, Lemma 5.1]). Consequently, its maximum must be attained
either on ‚àÇDŒ≥R ‚à©C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ) or on DŒ≥R ‚à©‚àÇC ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ). On ‚àÇDŒ≥R ‚à©C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ), we know
that w ‚â§ 0 by assumption and that œïŒ¥ ‚â• 0, by construction. On DŒ≥R ‚à© ‚àÇC ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ),
we have that œïŒ¥ ‚â• M ‚â• w, by construction. This implies that w ‚â§ œïŒ¥ on DŒ¥ and, in
particular, that w(x, y, t) ‚â§ Œ¥(t ‚àí tmin ) on DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ‚àí Œ¥), by construction of œáŒ¥ .
Since this is true for all Œ¥ > 0 and since w is continuous, we nally get that w ‚â§ 0 on
DŒ≥R ‚à© C ‚àí (x0 , y0 , t0 ) which is a contradiction with M > 0.

Proof of Theorem 6.3.1 with (H2).   The idea is to reduce ourselves to the case (H1) by
showing that if we modify the boundary curve Œ≥ far away from the origin, the local
behaviour of the height function does not change, thanks to assumption (H2).
   More precisely, given any a > 0, we modify the boundary condition for |x|‚â• a by
dening e.g for all x ‚àà R,

and similarly fŒ≥a (x, y, Œ≥a (x)) = fŒ≥ (x, y, Œ≥(x)). Since the boundary curve Œ≥a now satises

152     CHAPTER 6. A NEW BIJECTION BETWEEN THE GW AND BF MODELS
Proof. The proof of Lemma 6.3.11 is, in essence, similar to that of Proposition 4.4.5
and [LT18, Proposition 5.12]. The idea is to show that if hL,a and hL dier somewhere
on K , then we can construct a long increasing sequence of Poisson points representing
the "propagation of the perturbation" coming from outside [‚àía, a] and to show that such
chain has a small probability to occur.

Construction of a "long" chain of Poisson points.                 If hL (x0 , y0 , t0 ) > hL,a (x0 , y0 , t0 )
for some |x0 |‚â§ a (the case where hL (x0 , y0 , t0 ) < hL,a (x0 , y0 , t0 ) can be treated similarly),
let us explain briey how we can construct, by induction, some real number x such that
|x |‚â• a and a sequence of points (xi , yi , ti )i‚àà1,n ‚àà R3 such that (Lxi , Lyi , Lti ) ‚àà œâ for
all i (which requires Lyi ‚àà Z) and

   1. |Lyi+1 ‚àí Lyi |‚â§ 1 for all i ‚â§ n ‚àí 1,

   2. (xi+1 , ti+1 ) ‚àà C ‚àí (xi , ti ) for all i ‚â§ n ‚àí 1 and (x , Œ≥(x )) ‚àà C ‚àí (xn , tn ),

   3. n ‚â• L (hL (x0 , y0 , t0 ) ‚àí hL (x , y0 , Œ≥(x ))).

Let (Lx , Œ≥(Lx )) be a maximiser in the variational formula (6.2.10) computed for the
height h(Lx0 , Ly0 , Lt0 , hL         2
                                Œ≥ , œâ) . By denition, there exists a sequence (Lxi , Ly0 , Lti )1‚â§i‚â§n
of points in œâÃÉ Ly0 ‚à© LR(x ,Œ≥(x )),(x0 ,t0 ) satisfying the three conditions above.
    - If |x |‚â• a, then we are done.
    - If |x |< a, since we assumed that hL (x0 , y0 , t0 ) > hL,a (x0 , y0 , t0 ) and since the
boundary conditions of both functions agree on [‚àía, a], then there must exists some
(Lxk0 , Ly0 , Ltk0 ) in the previous sequence such that hL (xk0 , y0 , t‚àí                            ‚àí
                                                                             k0 ) = hL,a (xk0 , y0 , tk0 )
but hL (xk0 , y0 , tk0 ) > hL,a (xk0 , y0 , tk0 ) and thus corresponds to a creation that has been
accepted for the rst height function but not for the second. Since hL (xk0 , y0 , t‚àí            k0 ) =
                  ‚àí
hL,a (xk0 , y0 , tk0 ) and because of the slope constraint (6.2.5), this can happen only if
hL (xk0 , y0 + Œµ0 /L, t‚àí                                 ‚àí
                         k0 ) > hL,a (xk0 , y0 + Œµ0 /L, tk0 ) for some Œµ0 ‚àà {‚àí1, 1}. We begin our
construction by keeping (Lxi , Ly0 , Lti )1‚â§i‚â§k0 and complete the chain by repeating the
procedure starting from (Lxk0 , Ly0  + Œµ0 , Ltk0 ). We stop the construction when the
maximiser in (6.2.10) is attained outside [‚àía, a] 3 .

    It remains to be checked that the length of the chain obtained by the procedure above
satises condition 3. This can be done by induction on the number of steps needed for
the procedure to stop.
    If it stops after only one step, then, by construction, there is nothing to show.
    If we assume that condition 3 is satised when the procedure nishes after p ‚â• 1
steps, let us show that this is also the case if it nishes after p + 1 steps. Using the
notations of the construction as above, the length of the chain is equal to the sum of k0
   we assume implicitly that œâ is restricted to a
   2
                                                              xed nite ball chosen large enough so that
                     Œ≥ , œâ) > h(Lx0 , Ly0 , Lt0 , hŒ≥a , œâ).
h(Lx0 , Ly0 , Lt0 , hL                             L

     The procedure has to stop after nitely many steps because, otherwise, there would be an innite
chain of Poisson points in [‚àíLa, La] √ó Z √ó [min{Œ≥(Lx), |x|‚â§ a}, Œ≥(Lx0 )] which does not happen almost
surely by standard arguments already explained e.g in Remark 4.2.3.

Since   (Lxk0 , Ly0 , tk0 )   corresponds to an accepted creation for       hL ,    if   Œµ0 = 1,   then the
l.h.s of (6.3.23) must be equal to         0   and the r.h.s is always non-positive (because of
(6.2.5)). Likewise, if   Œµ0 = ‚àí1, then the l.h.s of (6.3.23) must be equal to 1/L and the
r.h.s is always less   than 1/L (still by (6.2.5)). This concludes the proof of (6.3.22) and
thus of the existence of such chain of Poisson points satisfying the three conditions above.


   Lastly, because of assumption (H2) (and monotonicity w.r.t time of                     h),   we have that
                                                               
                    L hL (x0 , y0 , t0 ) ‚àí hL (x , y0 , Œ≥(x )) ‚â• L C(a, K)    |x |,

uniformly on     (x0 , y0 , t0 ) ‚àà K , |x |‚â• a and L ‚àà N and where C(a, K) is a constant
that goes to    innity when a tends to innity. The proof of Lemma 6.3.11 is concluded
by showing that the probability that such a chain of Poisson points of length at least
L C(a, K) |x | exists in a light-rectangle of area of order O(L2 |x |) decays exponentially
in L, if a is chosen large enough. This is a classical bound whose proof can be found e.g
in Lemma 4.C.1.

Mod√®les de croissance de surfaces al√©atoires : limites hydro-
dynamiques et uctuations.
R√©sum√©. Ce travail porte sur certains mod√®les de croissance d'interfaces al√©atoires
dont l'√©volution microscopique est typiquement repr√©sent√©e par une cha√Æne de Markov.
Un des but principaux est de d√©montrer la limite hydrodynamique i.e la convergence de
l'interface r√©√©chelonn√©e vers une interface macroscopique d√©terministe dont le mouvement
est r√©gi par une √©quation de Hamilton-Jacobi. Ensuite, on s'int√©resse aux uctuations i.e
l'√©cart entre l'interface al√©atoire et sa limite hydrodynamique. Il est conjectur√© que ces
uctuations se comportent, √† grande √©chelle, comme la solution de l'√©quation de Kardar-
Parisi-Zhang et ce, ind√©pendamment des sp√©cicit√©s microscopiques du mod√®le choisi : on
parle de classe d'universalit√© KPZ. Dans le cas d'interfaces bi-dimensionnelles, la conjec-
ture de Wolf pr√©voit, en fonction des sym√©tries du mod√®le, deux classes d'universalit√©s
di√©rentes : Isotrope ou Anisotrope.
    Dans cette th√®se, nous nous concentrons sur deux mod√®les de surfaces stochastiques
dans la classe d'universalit√© KPZ Anisotrope introduits par Gates-Wetcott et Borodin-
Ferrari. Notre r√©sultat principal est la d√©monstration de la limite hydrodynamique pour
chacun de ces deux mod√®les. Nous montrons √©galement une borne sup√©rieure sur les

Random surface growth models: hydrodynamic limits and
uctuations.
Abstract. This work is about some random interface growth models whose microscopic
evolution is typically represented by a Markov chain. One of the main purposes is to
show the hydrodynamic limit i.e the convergence of the rescaled interface to a determinis-
tic macroscopic interface whose evolution is ruled by a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Then,
we are interested in uctuations i.e the dierence between the random interface and its
hydrodynamic limit. It is conjectured that the large-scale uctuations behave like the
solution of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation independently of the microscopic details of
the model considered: we speak of KPZ universality class. As far as two-dimensional
interfaces are concerned, Wolf's conjecture predicts two dierent universality classes de-
pending on the symmetries of the model: Isotropic or Anisotropic.
In this thesis, we focus on two random surface models in the Anisotrpic KPZ universality
class introduced respectively by Gates-Westcott and Borodin-Ferrari. Our main result
is the proof of the hydrodynamic limit for both models. Also, we show an upper bound
on the uctuations of the Gates-Westciott model that agrees with Wolf's conjecture.
Finally, we explore the relations between these two models and generalise them.
