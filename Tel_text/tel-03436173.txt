Remerciements

   Je tiens tout d’abord à remercier mon directeur de thèse, Thierry Mayer, pour ses conseils avisés et
ses nombreuses suggestions qui ont grandement contribué à améliorer ces travaux. Cette thèse doit
également beaucoup à Emeric Henry, dont la disponibilité et le soutien constant ont été extrêmement
précieux.
   J’ai aussi eu la chance de pouvoir travailler avec des coauteurs idéaux: Emanuele, toujours en-
thousiaste et dynamique; Arthur, bien plus patient que je ne le mérite et Etienne, jamais avare de
bonnes idées. Aucun des chapitres de cette thèse n’aurait pu voir le jour sans ces collaborations.
   Je remercie également Maria Bas, Matthieu Crozet, Anne-Célia Disdier, Cécile Gaubert et à nou-
veau Emeric Henry qui ont accepté d’être membres de mon jury. Leurs commentaires et suggestions
aideront grandement à améliorer les papiers ici proposés.
   Cette thèse a beaucoup bénéficié de l’environnement très favorable du département d’économie
et du LIEPP, des séminaires nombreux et variés qui y ont été organisés, et des discussions aussi
stimulantes qu’enrichissantes avec les professeurs. Je remercie en particulier Golvine de Rocham-
beau, Guy Laroque, Florian Oswald, Johannes Boehm, Julia Cagé, Thomas Chaney, Philippe Martin,
Pierre-Henri Bono, Nicolas Coeurdacier, Etienne Wasmer, Jeanne Commault et Jean-Marc Robin. Je
remercie également les organisateurs du Paris Trade Seminar, qui fut une excellente opportunité
pour découvrir les travaux les plus récents en commerce international et donna lieu à de nombreux
échanges avec les chercheurs invités. Et un grand merci aux équipes administratives du département
d’économie, du LIEPP et de l’école doctorale: Pilar Calvo, Claudine Lamaze, Sandrine le Goff, Cé-
cile Markarian, Christelle Hoteit, Samira Jebli, Juliette Seban, Hadjila Nezlioui-Serraz, et Guillaume
Sarrat de Tramezaigues.
   Il me faut également souligner l’apport inestimable des échanges avec mes camarades doctorants.
Il est certain que ces travaux seraient bien moins aboutis sans les nombreuses rencontres qui ont
émaillé les quelques années passées dans les combles. Je tiens en particulier à remercier Charles,
entomologue de génie, qui des pubs de Cardiff aux terrains d’urban d’Aubervilliers a toujours su
ouvrir de nouvelles perspectives sur la discipline; Ludovic “sneaky lobster” pour les innombrables
discussions; Pierre D. pour ses tâcles rugueux; Florin, qui m’a tant appris sur Trump, les tabloïds
britanniques et la Moldavie; Jean-Louis, sauveur du bâtiment et prévisionniste officiel du Mondial
2018, et Elisa, pour sa participation indispensable aux pauses solarium. Je me souviendrai aussi
des nombreuses discussions et des bons moments passés avec Jean-Baptiste, Aseem, Joanne, Jan,
Clément, Léa, Sophie, Marcos, Nicolo, Edoardo, Marcos, Paul, Florence, Lucas, Julien, Quentin,
Pierre G., Odran, Assia, Eve, Jules, Stefan, Tyler, Andreea, Jean-Benoît, Guillaume C., Guillaume W.,
Valeria, Camille, et Riccardo.

   Une nouvelle page de ma thèse s’est ouverte en 2019, et je remercie Sébastien Jean et Vincent
Vicard de m’avoir fait confiance en me permettant d’intégrer le CEPII. Parce qu’il marie recherche et
étude des grandes questions d’économie internationale, le CEPII est pour moi une source inépuisable
de découvertes et d’apprentissages. C’est aussi un long couloir peuplé de fins connaisseurs du com-
merce international: merci à Alix, Cécilia, Charlotte, Cristina, Deniz, Gianluca, Houssein, Kévin et
Laurence qui ont si rapidement partagé leur expertise avec moi. En poussant un peu dans le couloir,
on découvre une équipe migration et une équipe macro avec lesquelles les échanges sont aussi animés
que passionnants: merci donc à Anthony, Axelle, Camilo, Carl, Christophe, Erica, Isabelle, Julia et
Thomas. Le CEPII ne fonctionnerait pas aussi bien sans l’aide précieuse d’Arnaud, Béatrice, Dimitri,
Evguénia, Laure, Sophie, Sylvie et Véronique. Je n’oublie pas les collègues du CAE, qui, même s’ils
ne sont pas au même étage, sont vite devenus des compagnons indispensables: merci à Madeleine,
Florentin, Samuel, Baptiste et bien sûr Etienne à nouveau, que j’ai eu la chance de continuer à cô-
toyer après mon départ du département d’économie. Et merci à Deniz, Aude et Guillaume, avec qui
c’est toujours un plaisir de travailler. La cantine et le Lab’ se sont rapidement établis comme des
rendez-vous incontournables où se tiennent des débats aussi variés qu’inattendus, dont la valeur est
inappréciable.
   Enfin, je remercie les nombreux amis qui n’ont pas désespéré de me voir terminer cette thèse
un jour, et sans qui tout aurait été infiniment plus difficile. Merci à Cédric, infatigablement présent
pour m’encourager; Lilian, juge implacable de l’enjaillement; Damien, jamais aussi désenchanté que
dans la défaite; Laura, avocate redoutable et copilote indulgente; Jo, aux talents si multiples que je
renonce à les recenser; Clarisse, rivale imbattable aux blind tests, et bien sûr Martin Bernard, hôte
de tant de soirées mémorables. Merci également à tous les autres gagnants du Ton Air: Diana, Dédé,
Thomas, Bastien, Charlotte, Marie-Sophie, Pierre, Florent, Maxime, Mégane, Barbara, et Judith,
victorieuse par procuration. Je pense également à la team Rive Gauche, dont le centre de gravité s’est
certes inexorablement déplacé depuis les premières années à Sciences Po, mais au sein de laquelle
la bonne humeur est toujours au rendez-vous: Julie, fidèle soutien sudiste depuis mon arrivée à
Paris; Caroline, pas sudiste par la géographie mais on l’oublierait presque; Sean, toujours partant
pour parler des sujets les plus variés; Anne-Sophie et son l’enthousiasme communicatif; Louise,
interrogatrice impitoyable mais si bienveillante; et aussi Camille, Christophe, Martin, Elsa, Aster,
Cyril, Aurélie, Jean-Baptiste, Laura, Emmanuel, et le petit Jean. Et merci aux amis dignois, Caroline,
Rémi, Malcolm et Vincent, car c’est dans les paysages bas-alpins que tout a commencé.
   Enfin, et par-dessus tout, rien n’aurait été possible sans le soutien constant de toute ma famille. Je
remercie en particulier mon frère Vincent, ma sœur Lucie et mes grand-parents. Et je ne saurais dire
à quel point je suis reconnaissant envers mes parents, qui m’ont tant appris, et m’ont fait confiance
de bout en bout, sans trop me demander quand tout cela serait terminé.

Introduction

    Spatial frictions are key in explaining many economic phenomena. This thesis provides three
pieces of evidence on the origins, prevalence and consequences of such frictions.
    In the first chapter, we focus on spatial frictions in the diffusion of knowledge. We explain the
puzzling persistence and stability of the spatial decay in patent citation flows by innovator networks.
We establish that knowledge percolates: firms disproportionately cite new patents from prior con-
tacts, and form links with contacts of their contacts. Embedding this percolation into a network
formation model is sufficient to rationalize the negative link between aggregate knowledge flows
and distance.
    In the second chapter, we shed some light on the role of spatial information frictions in shaping
international trade flows. We make use of the specific context of the XIXth Century, during which
the creation of international news agencies facilitated the transmission of information across coun-
tries. We show that trade between a pair of countries increases when both are covered by a news
agency. The reduction in information friction was therefore one of the many factors behind the First
Globalization.
    The last chapter investigates whether transport costs are the main component of within-country
trade costs. While it is well-established that international trade costs are not limited to transport
costs, evidence is much scarcer for intra-national trade flows. We use hurricane Sandy as a natural
experiment shifting upwards transport costs in some areas of the US to establish that if transport
costs were the sole driver of the distance elasticity of trade flows within the US, this distance elasticity
would be much lower.


Chapter 1: The Percolation of Knowledge across Space

    Despite considerable improvements in information and communication technologies in the past
three decades, geographical distance remains a serious hindrance to knowledge diffusion. We esti-
mate the elasticity of international patent citation flows with respect to geographical distance and
show that it has remained very stable from 1980 to 2010, around −0.3, meaning that a 10% increase
in the distance between two countries is associated with a 3% decrease in citations between them.
This is surprising as most conventional distance-related costs, such as transport costs or tariffs, do
not apply to ideas. Even more puzzling is the fact that digitization and communication technologies
such as online patent search tools seem to have had no effect on knowledge diffusion as a whole.
    This chapter shows that the dynamics of network formation over firms’ life-cycle are key to un-
derstanding the aggregate effect of distance: young and small firms have spatially close contacts,
and gradually expand their network as they grow.

   Our contribution is twofold. In a first part, we identify how links form: we document a phe-
nomenon called “triadic closure” in the economics of networks literature, in which firms dispropor-
tionately form links with firms two steps away from them (i.e. with contacts of contacts). To unveil
this mechanism, we build all network links through patent citations, and implement a novel identifi-
cation strategy to show the influence of the network on the probability that a link forms. We provide
evidence that firms are more aware of knowledge originating from firms they are linked with (their
contacts), and are prone to linking with the contacts of their contacts. This diffusion process is remi-
niscent of the physics phenomenon of percolation, approaching knowledge as a fluid making its way
from one inventor to another along network paths.
   We causally test the influence of existing contact links on the network formation between inno-
vators. Using previous patent citations to build contacts, we show that a firm is more likely to cite
either a patent originating from a contact or cited by a contact than a similar patent from outside
its close network. For identification, we exploit the fact that some citations are added by applicants
while others are added by the office examiners, the union of which provides us with a group of
counterfactual citations under frictionless knowledge circulation. We estimate the effect of a direct
or indirect link on the likelihood of being cited by the applicant itself (versus the likelihood of being
cited by the examiner). We find that firms are 1.5 times more likely than examiners to cite patents
owned by their contacts, yet hiding some heterogeneity between small and large firms. Moreover,
firms are 35% more likely to cite patents that were cited directly by their contacts. These effects are
robust to a wide range of checks.
   In a second part of the paper, we show the aggregate consequences of this network formation
process, and in particular how it can explain the effect of distance on knowledge flows. To do so,
we incorporate the above diffusion process into a model, in which firms grow over time as their
network spreads step by step, implying that firms are less and less affected by distance as their size
and age increase, simply because of the time they have had to expand their network. This model
delivers two predictions, relative to the firm size distribution and the relation between firm size and
the distance of citations, which naturally lead to an aggregate effect of distance. Firstly, the size
distribution of innovators should be Pareto. Secondly, an increasing power function should link the
average (squared) distance at which firms cite to their size.
   We find that these features hold remarkably well in the data. On top of being sufficient conditions
to generate a constant negative distance elasticity, these two predictions of the model are interesting
stylized facts in their own right. Indeed, we show that, beyond being well-described by a Pareto
distribution, the size distribution of innovators actually enters the class of economic objects following
a Zipf law. Similarly, the systematic relationship between an innovator’s size and the distance at
which it is able to access to knowledge is a novel finding, which we find to hold very well in a variety
of settings, both in cross-section and over time.
   An important takeaway of this paper is that small firms are the main contributors to the aggregate
effect of distance. Innovators start off relying on knowledge produced by contacts located close to
them, and get links with innovators located further away as they grow through network search. We
find that while the overall effect of distance remained constant over time, the relationship between
size and distance of citations weakened in our period of study: we show that this was caused by
small innovators accessing more distant knowledge. Although this should have implied a decrease

in the overall effect of distance, it seems to have been offset by an increased share of small innovators
versus large ones.
   Interestingly, the network formation mechanism put forward is general enough to encompass
many of the usual explanations of the localization of knowledge spillovers: it is consistent with formal
R&D collaboration agreements and the natural network they generate, but also with explanations
based on cultural proximity and common ethnicity (Agrawal et al., 2008; Kerr, 2008), as well as
inter-firm mobility of engineers (Almeida and Kogut, 1999; Breschi and Lissoni, 2009; Serafinelli,
2019), and input-output linkages (Carvalho and Voigtländer, 2014).


Chapter 2: Information in the First Globalization: News Agencies and
Trade

   Just as knowledge, information does not flow frictionless across borders. These constraints on
the international diffusion of information are likely to impede trade, since knowledge of the foreign
market characteristics (market size, price, trade costs, demand shifters) is of prime importance for
the exporters, while for the importers, the sourcing choice is determined by the information available
on price and quality from different markets.
   The specific context of the XIXth century provides a unique opportunity to document the im-
portance of information in shaping trade patterns. Indeed, this period witnessed the birth of global
news agencies, which systematically collected and transmitted information across borders, so that,
for the first time, news became widely available from almost all parts of the globe, with sharply
reduced delays. News agencies are wholesalers of information: they gather news and sell them to
governments, businesses, and newspapers. The three largest news agencies quickly syndicated into
an efficient cost-sharing organization: each of them was given a monopoly over a set of countries,
and in exchange committed to share information on these countries with the other news agencies.
The sharing of information among the three global news agencies was truthfully enforced, since it
ensured that they would stay ahead of the competition. Therefore, being covered by a global news
agency meant becoming part of an international network of news sharing, including commercial
news.
   The development of international news agencies was deeply intertwined with the construction
of an international telegraph network: news agencies relied on the telegraph to communicate and
often contributed to its expansion. The telegraph was a considerable improvement upon previous
technologies (physical transport of the mail on steamships, railways or horses) which had a consid-
erably lower speed (sometimes months) and more volatile delivery times. It made communications
easier, but it did not provide a centralized and reliable source of business information. In other
words, in the absence of a global news agency, telegraphs reduced only the communication frictions,
without affecting much the amount of information available to the public. Typically, communica-
tion was private and only benefited to the users of the telegraph themselves. On the other hand,
news agencies collected, gathered and sold information that could then be accessed by anyone at a
low cost. Our analysis disentangles the effects of reduced communication costs from the effects of
improved information access, a distinction that previous studies were unable to make.
   These two major innovations did not affect all pairs of countries simultaneously. The success

of the telegraph was immediate, but the cost of the infrastructure and technical factors meant that
not all countries could be quickly connected. Similarly, the global news agencies did not cover
the entire world immediately. They started by sharing Europe and then extended gradually the
scope of their syndication agreement through contracts struck in 1859, 1867, 1876, 1889 and 1902.
This sequential entry of country pairs into the telegraph and news agencies networks is key for our
identification strategy, because it allows us to estimate a panel data version of the gravity equation,
meaning that on top of the usual origin and destination time varying fixed effects, we can include
country-pair fixed effects, which control for any time-unvarying characteristic of the two countries.
   To identify the information channel, we focus on the interaction between telegraph connections
and news agency coverage: while the effect of the telegraph alone can be attributed to the sole
decrease in communication costs, the interacted term specifically isolates the contribution of an
improved access to news on the potential trade partner. The effect is sizable: our estimates imply that
trade increases by an additional 30% when two countries are included in the global network of news
diffusion, on top of being connected by a telegraph. Additionally, we corroborate previous studies
that documented a positive effect on trade of the telegraph. We find that, even in the absence of
coverage by a global news agency, trade flows increase by 40% when two countries become connected
by a telegraph. However, news agencies, in the absence of telegraph, do not trigger any significant
increase in trade, suggesting that they were unable to operate at full efficiency without an appropriate
communication technology.
   We then analyze the time dynamics of the effect through an event-study, and find a progressive
increase in its magnitude, which slowly rises up to thirty years after the dyads are connected, a picture
consistent with a slow constitution of business networks between the countries that benefited from
an improved mutual access to information. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis
that the trade effect is indeed driven by an increase in the quantity of information available on foreign
countries. First, we document an increase in trade volatility after the connection, in line with the
findings of Steinwender, 2018. This is consistent with a better ability of traders to adapt to market
conditions. Second, using data on French newspapers, we find an increase in the presence of a
country in the articles once this country benefits from a telegraph connection and from news agency
coverage.
   While estimated from a historical event, the results are relevant to understand contemporary
trade flows, since exporters still may lack the necessary information, despite considerable improve-
ment in communication technologies. This chapter does not take a stance on the precise mechanisms
through which better access to information on foreign countries affects trade. The fact that the effect
keeps growing over a relatively long time horizon suggests that improved information may have af-
fected trade through long-run channels, such as Foreign Direct Investment, human migration flows
or even a convergence in cultural tastes.


Chapter 3: Trade and Transport Costs: Evidence from Hurricane Sandy

   International trade flows decrease strongly when distance increases, and only part of this de-
crease can be attributed to transport costs. This points to the existence of other, large, “dark” trade
costs, not observable but whose presence is necessary to rationalize the observed gravity patterns

of trade flows (Head and Mayer, 2013). Potential sources for these frictions are diverse. They in-
clude, for example, differences in culture and tastes, a lack of mutual trust, and the spatial decay of
information (as evidenced in the first two chapters). We could expect these additional dark trade
costs to be lower within countries: culture and tastes are arguably more similar within a country
than between countries, the spatial decay of information should be lower, and mutual trust should
be higher. Additionally, tariffs and the “grey” trade costs of crossing borders (non-tariff barriers to
trade) are absent. Nevertheless, in this chapter we show that only part of the distance elasticity of US
intra-national trade flows can be attributed to transport costs, pointing to the existence of additional
trade costs even within each country.
   More precisely, we find that while the total distance elasticity of within-US trade flows is -0.84,
this distance elasticity would be significantly smaller, around -0.06, if there were no other trade costs
than transport costs. This result is established by making use of a natural experiment: hurricane
Sandy, that hit the North-East of the US at the end of October 2012. The hurricane caused massive
disruptions on the transport infrastructure, leading to a sizable increase in transport costs in the
affected areas. Depending on the optimal path between each origin and destination, some dyads
were more affected by these disruptions than others: dyads for which a large share of the usual
optimal route goes through the affected region experienced a larger increase in transport costs than
dyads for which the usual optimal path avoids the damaged area. For instance, transport costs
between Los Angeles and Seattle were not affected at all, unlike transport costs between Boston and
Miami, among others. We obtain a lower bound for the road distance equivalent of this change in
transport costs and regress trade flows on this time varying distance. The distance effect obtained
doing so is much lower than its cross-sectional counterpart, which confirms that the cross-sectional
distance elasticity of trade flows captures trade costs unrelated to transport costs.
   We compute the change in transport costs induced by Sandy using a least cost path algorithm. We
decompose the american highway network into a grid of cells, each cell corresponding to a certain
cost, and look for the path between two points that minimizes the cost. A key parameter we have to
feed this algorithm with is an “overcost parameter”, which indicates by how much the cost increases
in areas affected by the hurricane. This parameter is estimated using an indirect inference method,
meaning that we minimize the distance between observed and predicted moments based on the
structural gravity model.
   The fact that the distance elasticity is not entirely attributable to transport costs still holds true
when we exclude dyads for which the bilateral change in transport costs that we compute might have
been less accurately determined. It also remains valid if we choose a more restrictive perimeter for
the areas affected by Sandy, or if we consider different durations for the disruptions caused by the
hurricane. Additionally, we provide evidence that firms did not advance or postpone their shipments
because of the hurricane, which would have resulted in a downward bias of our results. However,
we leave for future research the precise identification of channels through which these dark trade
costs operate.

This paper sheds new light on the negative effect of spatial distance on knowledge flows. We show
that it is rooted in the dynamics of the innovation network formation over firms’ life-cycles: young
and small firms have contacts near them, and progressively expand their network. Using patent
citations, we show that knowledge percolates: firms disproportionately cite new patents from prior
contacts, and form links with contacts of their contacts. A network formation model that builds on
these facts yields two predictions which are met in the data: firm sizes follow a Pareto distribution,
and larger firms cite further away. Combining these two facts naturally explains an effect of distance
and implies that small firms are its main contributors.



1       Introduction

    Despite considerable improvements in information and communication technologies in the past
three decades, geographical distance remains a serious hindrance to knowledge diffusion. As Figure
1.1 shows, the elasticity of international patent citation flows with respect to geographical distance
has remained very stable around −0.3, meaning that a 10% increase in the distance between two
countries is associated with a 3% decrease in citations between them over the whole period. This
is surprising as most conventional distance-related costs, such as transport costs or tariffs, do not
apply to ideas. Even more puzzling is the fact that digitization and communication technologies
such as online patent search tools seem to have had no effect on knowledge diffusion as a whole.
Several papers have argued that space hampers knowledge diffusion because knowledge travels
through social links, which are spatially clustered:1 these papers typically find that controlling for
social distance decreases the effect attributed to spatial distance.
    This paper shows that the dynamics of network formation over firms’ life-cycle are key to under-

standing the aggregate effect of distance: young and small firms have spatially close contacts, and
gradually expand their network as they grow. Our contribution is twofold. In a first part, we identify
how links form: we document a phenomenon called “triadic closure” in the economics of networks
literature,2 in which firms disproportionately form links with firms two steps away from them (i.e.
with contacts of contacts). To unveil this mechanism, we build all network links through patent
citations, and implement a novel identification strategy to show the influence of the network on the
probability that a link forms. We provide evidence that firms are more aware of knowledge origi-
nating from firms they are linked with (their contacts), and are prone to linking with the contacts
of their contacts. This diffusion process is reminiscent of the physics phenomenon of percolation,
approaching knowledge as a fluid making its way from one inventor to another along network paths.
In a second part of the paper, we show the aggregate consequences of this network formation pro-
cess, and in particular how it can explain the effect of distance on knowledge flows. To do so, we
incorporate the above diffusion process into a model, in which firms grow over time as their network
spreads step by step, implying that firms are less and less affected by distance as their size and age
increase, simply because of the time they have had to expand their network. This model delivers two
predictions, relative to the firm size distribution and the relation between firm size and the distance
of citations, which are met in the data and naturally lead to an aggregate effect of distance.
   Having a precise understanding of the forces underlying the imperfect dissemination of knowl-
edge is of prime importance. Innovation and technology diffusion are essential for growth as well
as convergence patterns between countries (Aghion and Jaravel, 2015; Akcigit et al., 2018; Buera
and Oberfield, 2020). Since only a small group of high income countries achieves a disproportion-

ate share of technological knowledge production,3 productivity growth in other countries depends
considerably on knowledge flows from those few highly innovative economies which are likely to
condition technology adoption.4 While the focus of the current paper is on international knowl-
edge flows, the extreme spatial concentration of innovation means this reasoning can be extended
at smaller scales such as regions or urban areas.
    Our first contribution is to document important facts on the network formation process between
innovators. We design a test for diffusion along the network links, relying on the use of examiner-
added citations to build a counterfactual for what innovators would cite if they knew every relevant
patent. When applying for a patent, innovators are required to give a list of all the patents on which
their invention builds. This list is completed by experts from the patent office, who add 60% of
all citations. Therefore, the union of applicant and examiner citations allows to construct an almost
ideal group of counterfactual citations in a world with frictionless knowledge diffusion. Patents cited
by examiners are indeed relevant to the patented invention and are observably similar to applicant
citations, but were not known by its applicant (otherwise she would have cited them). We use a
snapshot of the network using patent citations made by applicants in a given year, which indicate
a set of innovations they knew about, and control extensively for other citations that could have
occurred in the past between two applicants. By looking at whether, among our group of relevant
references, patents from linked firms are found disproportionately often in applicant-added citations,
we can identify the effect of the network of innovators on the use of knowledge.
    We estimate that firms are 1.5 times more likely to cite a patent belonging to one of their contacts
than if it originated from outside their network. This is however strongly heterogeneous, since firms
belonging to the bottom 99% of the size distribution rely twice as much on their existing network
as the 1% largest innovators. Moreover, percolation really operates since this effect expands beyond
direct links: we also find that the citation of a patent is 35% more likely when this patent had previ-
ously been cited by at least one of the firm’s contacts than when it was unknown from its contacts.
Our estimates are robust to the introduction of a range of control variables, as well as to a variety of
robustness tests. In particular, we address the facts that citations could be strategic, that applicant
and examiner-added references could have systematically different levels of relevance or that cita-
tions could be occurring within economic groups. Since the existing literature has put an emphasis
on spatial proximity rather than network connection, we build a similar strategy to the above one
but where search for new knowledge could be spatial. That is, firms could cite disproportionately
often the innovators located around them, as well as the innovators located around their contacts.
We find support for the above mechanisms, but show that that the effects are much weaker and less
robust.
    Our second contribution is to bridge the above findings with the aggregate distance effect. The
fact that distance negatively affects bilateral flows of goods has been widely studied in trade eco-
nomics (Head and Mayer, 2014a), through gravity equations. Interestingly, recent developments in
trade gravity models provide insights on the determinants of such spatial frictions for knowledge
flows, even though the nature of the object they apply to is different in many aspects (knowledge is
    3
      For instance, in 2011, roughly 80% of triadic patent families (patents applied for in USPTO, EPO and JPO) were
achieved by applicants residing in only 5 countries (Japan, the US, Germany, France, Korea). Source: http://stats.

      Along these lines, Comin and Hobijn (2010) estimate that cross-country variation in the timing of technology adoption
accounts for 25% of per capita income differences.

often assumed to be non-rival and non-excludable, in contrast with traded goods). Abstracting from
trade costs, Chaney (2018a) builds a dynamic model of network formation with search for inter-
national trade partners through the network, adapting the established idea of triadic closure in the
social networks literature, i.e. the disproportionately high likelihood to make friends with friends of
friends (Jackson and Rogers, 2007). The model describes an economy in which firms get knowledge
from contacts located further and further away as they grow older, but in which a constant growth
rate in the number of firms generates a large population of new and small firms relative to old and
large ones. This model generates predictions which connect directly to the distance feature of grav-
ity equations. As we have shown empirically, an analogous phenomenon takes place for knowledge
flows: firms initially access knowledge from spatially clustered contacts, and sequentially obtain
new sources of spillovers through their existing contacts. Since we also find empirical support for a
purely spatial search of knowledge, we extend Chaney (2018a)’s model to allow for the possibility
of “spatial search”,5 which we model as the possibility for firms to find new partners in the places
where they already have a contact.
    We bring to the data the two key theoretical predictions of the network formation model, which
are sufficient to explain the observed negative distance elasticity. Firstly, the size distribution of inno-
vators should be Pareto. Secondly, an increasing power function should link the average (squared)
distance at which firms cite to their size. We find that these features hold remarkably well in the data.
On top of being sufficient conditions to generate a constant negative distance elasticity, these two
predictions of the model are interesting stylized facts in their own right. Indeed, we show that, be-
yond being well-described by a Pareto distribution, the size distribution of innovators actually enters
the class of economic objects following a Zipf law. Similarly, the systematic relationship between an
innovator’s size and the distance at which it is able to access to knowledge is a novel finding, which
we find to hold very well in a variety of settings, both in cross-section and over time.
    An important takeaway of this paper is that small firms are the main contributors to the aggregate
effect of distance. Innovators start off relying on knowledge produced by contacts located close to
them, and get links with innovators located further away as they grow through network search. We
find that while the overall effect of distance remained constant over time, the relationship between
size and distance of citations weakened in our period of study: we show that this was caused by
small innovators accessing more distant knowledge. Although this should have implied a decrease
in the overall effect of distance, it seems to have been offset by an increased share of small innovators
versus large ones.
    This paper relates to several other strands of the literature. Micro evidence of spatial frictions in
the diffusion of knowledge were first brought out in Jaffe et al. (1993), comparing the colocation
rates of realized vs non realized citations, and was later discussed and refined by Thompson and
Fox-Kean (2005) and more recently by Murata et al. (2014). Thompson (2006) and Alcácer and
Gittelman (2006) contributed to this literature by using citations added by examiners to set forth
the local bias of applicants in their citations. We use the same tool in our identification strategy, this
time neutralizing the network bias of applicants rather than their spatial bias. The other main ap-
proach has used aggregate bilateral flows between geographical units and measured whether these
aggregated flows were affected by geographical variables (mostly administrative borders and dis-
    5
      Note that Chaney (2014) studies the network formation at the individual level and allows for an analogous type of
spatial search.

tance). This approach was pioneered by Maurseth and Verspagen (2002), and later used by Peri
(2005) and Li (2014). These papers also found a decay in the probability of a patent citation with
distance. Additionally to being less intense, knowledge spillovers between remote locations also take
longer to occur, as evidenced by Griffith et al. (2011), who showed that there exists a home bias in
the speed of citation, meaning that domestic institutions are quicker to cite domestic patents than
foreign institutions, a finding later confirmed by Li (2014).
   The effect of social networks on the diffusion of technological and scientific knowledge was first
studied using specific types of links. Singh (2005) studied interpersonal links through coinvention
within patents (which our analysis largely excludes by removing applicants’ self-citations) and found
that controlling for ties diminishes greatly the effect of geographical variables on the probability of a
citation. Similarly, Breschi and Lissoni (2009) found that controlling for mobility of skilled workers
between firms reduced the effect of distance. Agrawal et al. (2008) and Kerr (2008) proxied social
proximity with ethnicity as revealed from names and found it increased the probability of citation.
Head et al. (2019) studied citations between research articles in mathematics, and controlled for
social ties in a more elaborate way, building connections based on past acquaintances (working in
the same institution, being one’s PhD supervisor, etc.), and reached a similar conclusion. In the same
vein, Iaria et al. (2018) found that, by disrupting encounters and exchanges between scientists of
both sides of the conflict, WWI greatly reduced international knowledge flows, while Catalini et al.
(2018) showed that the opening of a low-cost airline increased collaboration between scientists at
both ends, implying that travel costs were an important friction to knowledge diffusion. Hypothe-
sizing that social interactions between adopters and non-adopters of a technology are at the root of
technology adoption, Comin et al. (2012) studied how a set of important technologies diffused in
space, exploring an hypothesis relying on traveling routes and social interactions.
   In contrast with the above strand of the literature, we do not restrict our attention to a partic-
ular type of links. This flexible approach is allowed by the fact that we use past patent citations
to construct the network of innovators: rather than constructing links based for instance on R&D
collaborations, we initialize the contacts of an applicant using the citations made in a given year. We
ask how likely it is that knowledge will flow again along a link, either through the citation of another
of the contact’s patents, or through the citation of a patent previously cited by the contact. This
provides an asymmetric measure of links which is general enough to encompass many of the usual
explanations of the localization of knowledge spillovers: citations could capture links as diverse as
formal R&D collaboration agreements, linkages with geographical neighbors (e.g. inside clusters),
inter-firm mobility of engineers, input-output linkages, acquaintances from college between inven-
tors, etc. While we lack information on the nature of these links, such generality is a major advantage
if one wants to explain phenomena observed in aggregate.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the data and repli-
cates the stylized fact that distance negatively affects the intensity of international knowledge flows.
Section 3 provides micro evidence of knowledge percolation from actual link formation between
contacts, while section 4 builds a theoretical framework linking dynamic network formation with
the effect of distance. Finally, section 5 empirically shows that the aggregate theoretical predictions
hold on patent citation data.

2       Data and Stylized Fact

2.1     Data

Patent Citations.        The standard approach in the literature to track knowledge flows has been the
use of patent citations: when applying for a patent, the applicant is required to cite the relevant prior
art on which its invention builds. Therefore, the widespread assumption made by this literature is
that a patent citation reflects a knowledge transfer from the cited patent to the citing patent. Surveys
have given some empirical support to this assumption: surveying patent applicants at the USPTO,
Jaffe et al. (2000) found that a sizable share of citations did lead to a knowledge transfer. In the same
spirit, Duguet and MacGarvie (2005) surveyed French applicants at the EPO and found that citations
indeed correlate with ways for inventors to learn about new knowledge such as R&D collaboration
and technology licensing.
      Yet, patent citations are not a perfect proxy of knowledge flows. Reasons include the fact that
many patents are valueless, that citation rules vary across offices, that citations can be handled by
lawyers rather than inventors, include some strategic considerations (Lampe, 2012), or that inven-
tions are rarely patented in some industries. In a nutshell, assimilating patent citations to knowledge
flows could both introduce many citations having led to no knowledge transfer at all and miss knowl-
edge transfers which did not lead to a citation. In particular, a long-standing criticism towards the
use of patent citations as a proxy for knowledge flows has been the statistical noise and the potential
bias induced by the presence of examiner-added citations among the citations.
      Applicant and examiner citations are added according to the following procedure. At the time
of the application, patent assignees are asked to cite the relevant prior art, which helps judge the
patentability of the invention, and notably its novelty relative to the existing technological back-
ground. The exact nature of this requirement varies slightly across offices: for instance, applicants
at the USPTO have the obligation (called “duty of candor”) to do so for the patent to be enforceable
once granted, while the requirement is softer at the EPO.6 The application is then assigned to an
office examiner in the relevant group called art unit. To assess novelty of each of the claims that the
patent contains, the office examiner looks for relevant prior art and typically produces a comprehen-
sive search report which has to be thorough and exhaustive, making use of the variety of tools at
her disposal.7 It contains the documents that she considers to be relevant prior art and patents with
potentially overlapping claims. Based on this exhaustive search, the examiner adds references to the
patent.
      Fortunately, our database (Patstat, Fall 2016 edition) includes, for patent applications made in the
early 2000s onward, a variable indicating whether the citation was added by the applicant itself or by
the examiner during prosecution time. This piece of information was made available by the USPTO
in 2001 and in 1978 for the EPO. Consequently, it becomes widely available in the database for
patents applied for in the years 2000s (as shown in Figure 1.10 in the Appendix). In the population
from which we draw our samples (USPTO patents posterior to 2000), each patent has on average 5
    6
      Yet, as Akers (2000) explains, applicants at the EPO have incentives to cite the relevant patents when they file their
application.

      “Upon creation of a European search report [...], a pre-search algorithm generating a list of documents to be inspected
by the examiner is triggered.[...] The examiner should start the search process by formulating a search strategy, i.e. a plan
consisting of a series of search statements expressing the subject of the search, resulting in sections of the documentation
to be consulted for the search.” (EPO, 2016)

applicant-added citations, and 12 examiner-added citations (see Figure 1.12).
    An interesting fact is that the sequentiality of the citation procedures (applicant then examiner)
does not make overlapping citations impossible: indeed, out of the 73 million citations made within
the USPTO from 2000 on, 13% of citations are made by the examiner even though the applicant
had already made them, and this share rises to 20% when only the 47 million citations from patents
with at least one applicant-added citation are considered. This strongly suggests that examiner-
citations are chosen completely independently of the list of patents selected by the applicant. Note
that another very common phenomenon is self-citation, i.e. a citation pointing to a previous patent
of the assignee applying for the patent. Because these citations are by nature unable to reflect
knowledge transfers from outside the firm, we exclude them throughout the paper.8


Applicant and examiner citations’ characteristics.                Before exploiting differences between appli-
cant and examiner-added citations for identification, it is natural to compare their observable char-
acteristics. Figure 1.2 plots the distribution of four important observable characteristics for appli-
cant and examiner added citations. These characteristics are expressed as differences between the
citing and the cited patent: geographical distance (panel a), age (panel b), quality measured as
citations within a technological class (panel c), and technological distance measured as the Maha-
lanobis distance between patents’ IPC 3-digits technological classes (panel d). More detail on how
these variables are constructed is provided in Appendix A.
    While both types of citations could potentially exhibit very different characteristics, Figure 1.2
shows that they are in fact quite similar. Patents cited by applicants are a bit more likely to originate
from places geographically close to them, and are very slightly older. They are also of higher quality,
yet technologically further away from their invention than patents chosen by examiners. This sug-
gests that applicants tend to cite more salient references in the field, while examiners really look for
very close references even though they may not be as good nor as well-known. For the subsequent
analysis which compares both groups of citations, these slight differences are not a concern since we
can control for such systematic differences. Section 3.1 discusses the assumptions we make about
potential differences in unobservable characteristics between groups.


Patent Applicants. Patent applications distinguish between the people who actually developed the
claimed invention (called the inventors) and those who will obtain the legal rights over the invention
if the application is successful (equivalently called the applicants or the assignees throughout this
paper). Notably, inventors are usually employees of the institution which obtains the legal rights
over the invention. Therefore, inventors are always private individuals, while the vast majority of
assignees are firms. Since our focus is on firms, we determine the country of a patent through the
country of its assignee. However, for large firms, the country indicated on the patent may correspond
to the location of the headquarters, instead of the location where the innovation process actually took
place. In this case, using the country of the inventors would give a more accurate information on the
place where research was conducted. Thus, we also present results obtained using the inventors to
determine the patent’s country as a robustness check. Finally, 11% of the applications have several
assignees, potentially based in different countries. In such case, we consider the application to be
    8
    We consider an outward citation to be a “self-citation" as soon as the cited and the citing patent have at least one
common applicant or inventor.

located in the country that appears most frequently among the assignees (the mode), and if there is
no mode, we assign randomly one of the assignees’ countries to the patent.
            Patents do not include unique firm identifiers, therefore the allocation of a patent to a firm can
be made only through the assignee name indicated on the patent. A common issue is that the appli-
cant’s name may be different even for patents belonging to the same firm due to spelling mistakes,
spelling variations, and national units of large companies. Therefore, some algorithms were devel-
oped to harmonize applicant names. Patstat contains several name harmonizations, of which we use
the Patstat Standardized Name (PSN) applicant identifier.9 Note also that along with name harmo-
nization, Patstat contains information on the type (firm, university, etc.) of each applicant. Unless
specified otherwise, we keep only the applicants that are signalled as firms in this harmonization.
As a robustness check (shown in subsection 3.3), we also go a step further and conduct our analysis

           9

largest patentees, which is crucial when estimating a size distribution. Moreover, it is available for assignees at all offices
represented in Patstat, while the HAN harmonization conducted by the OECD is mostly for the EPO.

after matching names with the firm database Orbis, to check the consistency of the identifier and run
robustness checks at the group level.
      The information on the country of the assignee is only available for about half of the patents.
Nevertheless, there is a simple way to improve this figure by making use of the name harmonization
work performed by Patstat. Suppose the country is missing for a patent, but is available for another
patent granted to the same assignee: we consider that the country of the former patent is also the one
of the latter patent. Thanks to this method, we infer geographic information for an additional third
of the patents, which leaves us with only few patents without country information, as illustrated in
Figure 1.11.


Contacts. Our definition of contacts, which section 3 will use extensively, is the following. The set
of contacts f of a given firm is defined as all the assignees of patents truly cited (i.e. cited by the
applicant) in a given year which we use for initialization of the network. Unless specified otherwise,
contacts are initialized on citations made in year 2000, for the coverage reason mentioned above. For
this measure to remain an acceptable proxy of an existing link between two applicants, we exclude ci-
tations towards very large applicants (i.e. applicants belonging to the top 1% of the size distribution,
where size is measured as the total number of patent applications in the database). Our assumption
underlying this restriction is that industry leaders are too widely visible for a citation towards them to
be meaningful, and for differences of informational frictions between examiners and applicants to be
exploitable. Additionally, it makes the construction of the database considerably lighter (otherwise
all the citations made by all their patent applications would have to be constructed). We however
provide a sensitivity analysis to changes in this arbitrary threshold.
      We then build citation links of distance 2 in the network of any given applicant A, meaning that
such patents are two steps away from applicant A, having been cited by an applicant B which is
a contact of applicant A. Distance 2 links therefore consist of all the applicant citations made by
contacts, and define the contacts of contacts. These links are said to be directed: the fact that A cites
B implies a knowledge transfer from B to A, but has no implications for transfers from A to B. Building
these distance 2 links is computationally demanding. To alleviate the analysis conducted in section
3 while keeping high statistical power, we randomly select a third of all firms which would enter
our analysis, which amounts to more than 7,000 firms applying for 650,000 patents and citing more
than 10 million patents. Our analysis includes evidence that resampling has no effect on measured
coefficients.


2.2     Stylized Fact: the Persistent Effect of Distance on Knowledge Flows

      As an introductory exercise, we use patent citations to study the effect of geographical distance on
aggregate citation flows, in order to replicate findings by previous papers (Maurseth and Verspagen,
2002; Peri, 2005; Li, 2014). We therefore test for the existence of spatial frictions in the diffusion
of knowledge by studying the sensitivity of the flows of outward patent citations (citations made
by a patent, in contrast with the ones it might later receive) to distance. Our aim is to determine
whether, after accounting for countries’ heterogeneity in size and technology levels, distance still
affects the intensity of knowledge flows between two countries. This can be done using so-called
gravity equations, a very standard and widely used specification in international economics. The

citation flow from country o to country d (denoted Yod ) is the product of an origin specific component,
Ωo , a destination specific component, ∆d , and a bilateral resistance term, related to the geographical
distance between the countries (distod ) and to unobserved factors (ηod ).

                                        Yod = ∆d · Ωo · distod ζ · ηod                               (1.1)

   This equation can be estimated through OLS or through Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood
(PPML). All the country-specific elements, which make a location more likely to cite or be cited, are
accounted for by a set of origin and destination fixed effects. Most notably, the fixed effects account
for the “knowledge stock" of a country, without imposing any assumption on the functional form of
this stock, but also for the propensity to patent and the propensity to cite. Data on the geographical
distance between countries comes from the CEPII GeoDist.10 There are several ways to compute such
bilateral distances. The distance between the most populated city of each country is our baseline
measure of distance, but we additionally report results obtained with a “weighted distance” between
the main cities of each country provided in the above-cited database in the Appendix (Figure 1.16).
   The first exercise we conduct is to estimate the elasticity with respect to distance of bilateral
citations flows aggregated from 1980 to 2010. As Table 1.1 shows, distance significantly and strongly
affects citation flows between countries. The first column of the table indicates the distance elasticity
estimated on the complete sample of citations using OLS, while column 2 shows the same estimation
using only citations added by the applicants. Columns 3 and 4 show the corresponding estimates
using PPML regressions.
   The second exercise consists in running a series of yearly cross section estimations. This sheds
light on how the spatial decay of knowledge flows evolved over time. In order to ensure that the set
of dyads used in the PPML estimation does not vary over time, we balance our database by ensuring
that each potential pair of country is present at every point in time, potentially with a zero citation
flow. The results of these estimations were provided in the introduction (Figure 1.1) for the PPML
estimates. The distance elasticity hovers around −0.3 and is remarkably stable over time. The OLS
estimates provide a similar picture (see Figure 1.14 in the Appendix).
   The negative effect of distance on the intensity of international knowledge flows is a very robust
finding. In particular, as shown in Appendix B, it holds when the sample is disaggregated between the
three main patent offices (EPO, JPO and USPTO), and between wide technological sectors (sections
of the International Patent Classification, hereafter IPC). We also estimate equation (1.1) using a
different distance measure, a different estimator (OLS or Mixed Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood) and
considering an alternative way to determine the country of each patent. In all cases, the distance
elasticity of citation flows remains clearly negative (see Figures 1.15 and 1.16 as well as Tables 1.6,
1.7, 1.8 and 1.9 in the Appendix for further explanations and results).

3        Micro Evidence of Networked Knowledge Search

      Building on the fact that distance negatively affects knowledge flows in aggregate, we now delve
into its determinants through a micro-level analysis of applicants’ citation behaviour. This section
aims at explaining how the network is formed between inventors. Such analysis requires informa-
tion on the network of innovators. As described in section 2.1, we recover this network from past
knowledge flows. Based on this definition of the network, we ask two questions:

    1. Is an innovator more likely to cite patents of one of its contacts (than a similar patent owned
           by an applicant it is not linked to)?

    2. Is an innovator more likely to cite a patent known by at least one of its contacts (than a similar
           patent unknown from its contacts)?

The first test aims at providing evidence of the role of networks in the circulation of knowledge. The
second one unveils a network formation process, by looking at the existence of triadic closure, i.e.
links being formed between an innovator and a contact of one of its contacts.
      These two tests are depicted graphically in Figure 1.3, as well as through the following example.
Consider patent a, which was applied for by firm A, with priority year11 2000. This patent cited patent
b1 applied for by applicant B. Our first test assesses whether in its subsequent patent applications,
firm A is more likely to cite patent b2 , the other patent of its contact B, than similar control patents.
Furthermore, in an earlier application, B had cited patent c owned by applicant C. Our second test
investigates whether firm A is also more likely to cite patent c than similar control patents.

choices. In other words, the full set of patents which are relevant to an applicant’s invention is
unobserved. Therefore, we need to proxy it and restrain the set of potential alternatives to a set of
patents with characteristics such that they had a high probability of being cited. To achieve this, we
argue that patents added by the patent office during the examination process constitute a credible
set of potential yet non-realized citations.
    As shown in section 2.1, while there is no reason to expect that applicant and examiner-added
citations should be observably similar, the distribution of four important characteristics (spatial dis-
tance, age, quality difference and technological distance) of these citations are quite close and make
these sets observably comparable. Moreover, the remaining differences between these two groups
can easily be controlled for. Regarding unobservable characteristics, the identifying assumptions we
make are the following. We think of two key unobservable features: relevance to the citing patent,

and awareness of the person making the citation. In a nutshell, our identification strategy relies
on the assumption that the only unobserved characteristic along which patents in the two groups
(applicant and examiner-added) differ is whether the applicant was aware of them or not.
    Specifically, our first assumption is that all patents cited through either channel are relevant to
the patented invention, and that there are no systematic differences of relevance between examiner
and applicant citations. The first requirement that this assumption poses if for examiners to be
experts in their field, carry an extensive and independent search on relevant existing patents, and
to be little influenced by past searches they may have done. To validate our approach, we match
our sample with the PatEX database from USPTO’s Public PAIR data, which records information
about the examination process at the USPTO, notably the examiner in charge.12 Section A.3 in the
Appendix shows facts supporting our assumption: on average, examiners seem to be specialized in
fields, display little persistence in their behavior, and do not lose accuracy when they do cite a patent
several times.13
    There are however several ways in which the relevance of the cited patent could actually differ
between the examiner and applicant citations. Indeed, one could imagine that, if incentives for
citations to be accurate are not high enough on the applicant side, they might be tempted to add
irrelevant citations simply to validate their application. At the exact opposite, one could imagine that
applicants systematically cite all the major references, while the set of patents cited by the examiner
but not by the applicant (our set of control citations) would simply be a complement to these major
references with a lower relevance. If these major references were also more likely to have been
cited by the applicants in the past, we would only observe the process repeat itself, without any
implications on network formation. Nevertheless, because (as mentioned in Section 2.1) citations
often overlap, meaning that examiners cite patents that have already been cited by the applicant,
we can conduct the very same tests as in the baseline comparing only the overlapping set to the
rest of examiner-citations. In this setup, we compare the intersection of applicant and examiner
citation sets to its complementary in the set of examiner citations, rather than comparing the set of
applicant citations to its complementary set in the union of examiner and applicant citations. The
approach taking advantage of the overlap therefore neutralizes potential differences in the relevance
of citations made by examiners and applicants.14
    Our second identifying assumption is that if a patent is not cited by the applicant, this means
the applicant did not know about it. This is equivalent to assuming that applicants always have an
incentive to cite any relevant patent they know, because it strengthens their application and that
the examiner would find other relevant patents in any case. This is of course a simplification, and
neglects the possibility for applicants to strategically withhold some citations. Lampe (2012) notably
showed evidence that strategic withholding is frequent, using patents already cited by applicants in
the past, and cited by the examiner but not by the applicant in a subsequent application. If such
phenomenon is present in our data, it should however bias our estimates downwards. Indeed, a
   12
       We match approximately 5 million USPTO applications with examiner information.
   13
       Moreover, as shown by Lei and Wright (2017), the fact that a thorough search has been conducted is true even for
objectively weak patents, which tend to receive more attention even when they are eventually granted.
    14
       An important point to bear in mind is that the sequentiality of the citation procedure does not per se threaten our
identification. Indeed, we do not strictly compare applicant citations to examiner ones, but really applicant-added citations
to patents cited by the examiners but not cited by the applicant. Therefore, our strategy is not affected by the extent of
overlapping citations between the two sets such that the influence that applicant citations may have on the decision by
the examiner to cite these patents again or not is irrelevant for our purposes.

citation in the past would make the cited applicant a contact, who would later receive an examiner
citation but no applicant citation, going against the network effect we intend to estimate.15 We
however provide a robustness check where we reclassify as applicant citations all the citations made
by examiners toward patents or firms which had been cited by the applicant in the past.
    Expressing these assumptions in coherence with a discrete choice framework (the canonical Mc-
Fadden, 1973, conditional logit model), this means that applicants face a set of N relevant patents,
and are aware of k of them. Citing a patent they know costs 0 and is worth ε (for instance because
it increases the grant probability, or because it protects it from subsequent litigation). Searching
for unknown patents has a prohibitive cost η  ε, such that applicants always cite the k patents
they know out of N . Examiners complement the citations list with the N − k remaining patents (or
equivalently with any random subset of m out of the N − k remaining patents both observably and
unobservably similar to the non-cited ones).


Specification. We model the citation decision of patent o towards patent d as resulting from vari-
ations of an unobserved latent variable, Vod , which combines both the relevance of the (potentially)
cited patent d for the citing patent o, and the awareness of o for d (as in Head et al., 2019). A
citation occurs as soon as the value of Vod exceeds a given threshold, denoted κ. In other words,
defining a dummy variable Cod taking value 1 when patent o cites patent d:

                                               P(Cod = 1) = P(Vod > κ)

The value of the latent variable depends on Xod , a set of variables affecting the relevance of patent d
for patent o, and on our variable of interest, L od , the existence of a link between patent o and patent
d’s applicants:
                                           Vod = exp(ψL od + β 0 Xod + "od )

Taking logs, the probability of o citing d writes:

                                  P(Cod = 1) = P(−"od < ψL od + β 0 Xod − ln κ)

Assuming that "od follows a logistic distribution with location parameter 0 and scale parameter 1,
and denoting F the CDF of this distribution, this equation rewrites:

                                       P(Cod = 1) = F (ψL od + β 0 Xod − ln κ)                                         (1.2)

with F (x) = (1 + e−x )−1 , which can be estimated through maximum-likelihood. In order to neu-
tralize any characteristics specific to the origin patent (the o specific components of Xod ), we use a
conditional logit estimator. Nevertheless, there are still potential confounding factors that we need
to control for, as shown in Figure 1.2: the geographical distance between patent o and patent d,
their technological distance, the quality of patent d, and the age of patent d at the time patent o was
invented, as well as the persistence in citation behaviour.
    15
       More generally, it is difficult to imagine a mechanism which would bias our estimates upward. It would imply for
the patents originating from the applicant’s network to be always relevant yet unable to limit the claims of novelty in any
of the applications in the eyes of the examiner, and to be issued by firms unlikely to enter litigation. While this knife-edge
alignment may occur, it seems far too restrictive to play a first-order role in our effects.

      To truly identify the effect of the network, we also control extensively for potential persistence
in the citation behavior of applicants. We build a full set of dummy variables indicating in different
ways whether a patent has already been cited: if patent d was cited by at least one of the assignees
of o; if patent d was cited by at least one patent of one of the assignees of o before 2000 (at a
time where we do not know whether the citation originates from the applicant herself or from an
examiner). Similarly, we account for the fact that the assignee of the cited patents may be known to
the citing firm: we create a dummy equal to one when at least one of the assignees of d was cited
by at least one of the assignees of o, and another one indicating that at least one of the assignees of
d appears on at least one patent of at least one of the assignees of o before 2000. Finally, the cited
patent may already be cited by another patent of the Inpadoc family16 of o, which is accounted for
by another dummy variable.
      We keep only patents applied for at the USPTO to ensure consistency of the group of potential
alternatives across patents (different offices may have different behaviors in terms of examiner-added
citations and have different rules for applicant-added citations).17 Some citing patents could appear
more than once in our sample, because they have several assignees belonging to the set of studied
firms. We drop these duplicates and record L od = 1 as soon as at least one of the co-assignees is
linked with the destination patent. This ensures that we are left with one single observation per
patent dyad (combination of citing and cited patent).
      To summarize, our sample is made of the whole set of citations by our randomly selected ap-
plicants posterior to 2000 (applicant-added and examiner-added citations). Some of these citations
correspond to actual knowledge transfers (the applicant-added citations), others to patents that were
relevant but did not give rise to any knowledge transfer (examiner-added citations). Our dependent
variable is a dummy equal to one if patent o cites patent d through an applicant-added citation, zero
if d is cited only by the examiner. To test reliance on contacts’ patents, we include as a regressor a
dummy indicating whether an applicant of patent d is a contact of the applicant of patent o, where
contacts are defined as applicants (outside of the 1% largest) cited for the first time in year 2000. To
test dependence on citations from contacts, we include a dummy indicating whether patent d had
already been cited by a contact of the applicant of patent o. Table 1.10 in the Appendix presents
some summary statistics.


3.2     Results

      Table 1.2 presents the results for our two tests of network effects, looking at the set of randomly
selected firms having applied for a patent in year 2000, with coefficients expressed as odds ratios.
The first column of Table 1.2 shows the result of a simple binary logit regression without controls.
Column 2 displays logit coefficients but introduces all the control variables; column 3 is similar but
is estimated with conditional logit, which amounts to adding fixed-effects for citing patents to the
first column adds a set of control variables. Column 3 is our preferred specification: it accounts for
the fact that some citing patents have more applicant-added citations than others, as well as for any
feature depending only on the citing patent: size of the applicant, etc. The coefficient associated to

       The Inpadoc family identifier is a variable provided in Patstat, which clusters patent applications referring to the
same innovation, either because of renewals, resubmissions, submissions to several offices, etc.

       Note however that, to construct the network of firms, we use patents from all patent offices to ensure that the network
is as comprehensive as it could be.

         Note: Logit and conditional logit (when Orig. Pat. FE is checked) estimations of the determinants
         of knowledge transfers (equation (1.2)). The sample is the set of citations of the randomly selected
         applicants after 2000, from and to USPTO patents. The dependent variable is a dummy equal to 1 when
         there is an applicant-added citation of patent d by patent o. Contact is a dummy equal to 1 when
         patent d belongs to a contact of the firm. Cited by Contact is a dummy equal to 1 when patent d has
         been cited by a contact of the firm. “Orig. Patent FE” refer to conditional logit specifications. “Dest.
         patent Controls” include the logs of the age of the cited patent, the log of its quality, as well as of the
         geographical distance and the technological distance to the citing patent. “Persistence Controls” include
         dummy variables indicating whether a patent has already been cited by the applicant, either through
         an applicant citation or in general, whether the applicant has already been cited, and whether a patent
         of the same INPADOC patent family has already been cited, as well as a dummy accounting for whether
         a patent has been cited by a contact before information availability on AA and EA citations. In columns
         (4) and (5), the sample is halved according to the size of origin patents’ largest applicant, measured
         as the number of applications in the sample: “Small” refers to patents applied for by applicants below
         the median size, “Large” refers to patents applied for by applicants above the median size. Coefficients
         are exponentiated, standard errors refer to these exponentiated coefficients (i.e. coefficients are odds
         ratios). Standard errors are clustered at the citing patent level in all regressions. Significance levels:

           p<0.01 b p<0.05 c p<0.1.


contacts’ patents shows that belonging to a contact makes applicants around 1,5 times more likely
to cite a patent: this implies that applicants do rely on their network links in their citation behavior.
Incidentally, this test confirms that applicant citations are a meaningful tool to proxy contacts. Fo-
cusing on links of distance 2, column 3 shows that the fact of being cited by a contact increases the
probability of a citation by around 35%. This means that we do indeed observe triadic closure in the
formation of the innovators networks: applicants are disproportionately likely to form links towards
contacts of contacts.18 This property is key if one wants to link the network features to the overall
effect of distance on citations.
    Columns 4 and 5 estimate the test separately for two parts of the sample: we sort origin patents
according to the size of their largest applicant and split the sample at the median. Patents belong-
   18
     Interestingly, Carayol et al. (2019) find a negative effect on the probability of triadic closure in co-invention links
and argue it is due to choices of avoiding redundant connections. Their paper is focused on collaborations rather than
knowledge diffusion, it contradicts in no way the above result but rather complements it.

ing to firms below the median size are tagged as belonging to “small” firms, while above average
ones are tagged as “large” firms patents. These estimates show an interesting fact: small firms rely
substantially more on existing contacts, since they are 65% more likely to cite their contacts’ patents
than examiners, compared to 32% for large firms. In other words, small firms rely twice as often
on their contacts’ patents as large firms. This suggests that small firms are actually much more con-
strained in terms of the knowledge they have access to, therefore learning about a firm which has
produced a patent relevant to one of their applications makes them much more likely to rely on other
inventions from that same innovator in the future. In contrast, large firms access to different sources
of knowledge with less frictions, and are therefore less likely to rely on existing links. In contrast, the
coefficient on patents cited by contacts has a similar magnitude across size groups: this means that,
although the share of citations made up by contacts may decrease when firms get larger, they have
the same propensity to rely on their contacts’ contacts as a stepping stone to find novel sources of
knowledge. Therefore, the pace of network formation seems to be uniform over firms’ life-cycle, but
the breadth of the existing network strongly conditions firms’ citations. Sections 4 and 5 elaborate
on the differentiated roles of small and large firms, and their respective contribution to the aggregate
effect of distance.
      The fact that the coefficient associated to contacts’ patents is in the same order of magnitude as
the one for patents cited by contacts in our preferred specification is driven by several factors. First,
the coefficient on the former is strongly reduced by the various controls we introduce for persistence,
notably for repeated citations to the patent on which the link has been initialized. It is therefore a
very conservative estimate of the effect of links of distance 1 on citations. Second, as columns 4 and
5 of the above table show, it hides substantial heterogeneity: large firms are much less likely to rely
on contacts, but only a few of these firms constitute a very large share of patents and citations, hence
driving the coefficient down. Firm-level estimates shown in Table 1.17 in the Appendix confirm that
the absolute and the relative magnitude of coefficients varies a lot depending on what is considered to
be the relevant unit of observation, and on weights it implies. While the baseline unit of observation
is a citing - cited patent dyad, switching to a firm - year unit of observation weights small firms more
and increases coefficients, while switching to a citing - cited firm definition seems to weight large
firms more and drives coefficients down. Moreover, the contact variable is defined at the applicant
level, which largely dilutes the effect compared to the cited by contact variable, which is defined at
the patent level.


3.3     Robustness

      This subsection conducts a variety of robustness checks on our test for network search. These tests
can be divided in two categories: the majority of them consists in estimating coefficients on either the
same or a very similar sample as in the baseline with the same specification, which makes coefficients
comparable to the baseline. However in our alternative strategy and our firm-level estimates, the
tests are very close in spirit to the baseline but are they are conducted on samples with a different
structure which does not allow to compare the magnitude of the coefficients we obtain. For all the
tests delivering coefficients that can be compared with the baseline, Figure 1.4 plots the coefficients
and confidence intervals associated to the variables Contact and Cited by Contact for our preferred
specification (column 3 in Table 1.2).

Overlapping citations.      As mentioned above, a potential threat to the identification we propose
could be that patents cited by applicants and by examiners have systematically different levels of rel-
evance. For instance, it could be that while examiner-added citations are indeed relevant, applicant-
added citations may be somewhat fictitious references. This may be particularly problematic if firms
cite patents made by their contacts or cited by their contacts not because their discoveries are based
on them, but only to avoid making a thorough search to find the accurate references. Yet, because it
happens frequently that examiners cite a patent which was already in the list of applicant citations,
it is possible to conduct the exact same test on the examiner-added citations only, which means that
our dependent variable will take the value 1 only when a cited patent belongs to the overlapping
set of examiner and applicant added citations. The underlying assumption is that, contrary to our
baseline strategy in which all applicant patents are considered relevant, only patents eventually cited
by examiners are actually relevant.
   Table 1.11 displayed in the Appendix shows results similar to the baseline but defining our de-
pendent variable as being both an examiner and an applicant citation, and dropping all patents
which do not contain such citation. It shows that the coefficients on our variables of interest are very
similar to the ones we have in the baseline regression, which alleviates the potential concern that
our coefficients of interest might be biased if applicant citations were less relevant to the patented
invention than examiner citations.


Strategic citations The idea that citations could be strategic instruments, as shown by Lampe
(2012), is a valid point of concern for our identification strategy and deserves scrutiny. Lampe (2012)
spots such citations through the fact that applicants have cited a patent in the past, showing that the
applicant knew about it, but do not cite it in a further applicants even though the examiner cites it.
In such case, this patent meets both the awareness and the relevance conditions that should perfectly
predict a citation, yet it is not cited by the applicant. To handle this, we reclassify all patents meeting
this criterion (having been cited by an applicant in the past and being cited by the examiner only
later on) as patents cited by the applicant. This is denoted “patent definition” of strategic citations.
We also go one step further, and tag as strategic any citation made by the examiner but not by the
applicant toward a firm which had been cited in the past (we denote it “firm definition”).
   Table 1.12 in the Appendix shows coefficients calculated similarly to the baseline regressions
but reclassifying citations suspected to be strategically omitted as applicant-added citations. Note
that the fact of having been cited in the past, defined either at the applicant or at the firm level,
is part of the set of persistence controls introduced in all the regressions we display, but has to be
excluded here for collinearity reasons. This exclusion combined with the reclassification seems to
slightly inflate the estimates for the second test (use of contacts of contacts) at the expense of the
first one (use of contacts), but largely confirms the findings shown in the baseline regressions.


Group level results. A critical point in the interpretation of our results is the extent to which
assignees are correctly identified, in order to fully remove self-citations. Moreover, if firms have
subsidiaries, this may mean that citations occurring between a parent company and its subsidiaries
should be included in our analysis. This is a matter of concern, since links within the multina-
tional firm have been found to be important for knowledge flows (Keller and Yeaple, 2013; Bilir and
Morales, 2020), and that we want our mechanism to be valid beyond the borders of MNEs. Appendix

accounted for, shown in Table 1.13 in the Appendix, are very similar to the baseline ones.

Alternative Strategy. An alternative strategy can be pursued to conduct similar tests comparing
applicant-added citations to examiner-added ones, using the examiner-added citations to build false
links rather than as counterfactual citations. To test the reliance on contacts’ patents, one may com-

                                                                    35


pare the probability that this group cites patents developed by applicants truly cited in 2000 (actual
contacts) relative to applicants cited by examiners in 2000 (control group of contacts). Similarly, to
test for indirect links, rather than assessing whether the group of interest is more likely to cite patents
previously cited by contacts than its examiners, one may assess whether this group is more likely to
cite patents actually cited by its contacts than patents cited by its contacts’ examiners (i.e. examiners
for its contacts’ applications). This implicitly assumes that if a patent from a given applicant was
relevant once to a firm’s citing patent, then other patents of the former applicant should be relevant
in future citing patents.
      As shown in Table 1.14 in the Appendix, although coefficients are not comparable with the base-
line ones (mostly because we cannot control for characteristics of the origin patent, which is why
we do not include these coefficients in Figure 1.4), results largely confirm the effect of the network.
They show that contacts’ patents are more likely to get recited than their comparison group. Similarly,
patents cited by contacts get recited more than patents cited by examiners on contacts’ applications.


Other robustness checks.        We conduct a wider range of robustness checks: we change the initial-
ization year (Table 1.15), the maximum size of contacts (Table 1.16), measure our effects at the firm
level (Table 1.17), decompose our effect by size quartile (Table 1.19). We also run Placebo regres-
sions initializing contacts with examiner citations (Table 1.18). Additional explanations and result
tables for these tests are provided in Appendix C.


3.4     Spatial search of knowledge

      An alternative way of approaching our test can be to mix our study of network formation through
citations with the more traditional method used to emphasize local knowledge spillovers, originating
from Jaffe et al. (1993). Indeed, firms could be practising spatial search for knowledge parallel to
network search, looking for new relevant patents with a spatial bias from their existing knowledge
stock. This spatial search could include various mechanisms: firms could for instance have language
or cultural biases in contact formation, be more likely to go to tech fairs and shows where their con-
tacts are located, get biased internet search results from search engines based on their past searches,
follow some specialization operating within clusters. This means that a firm may have higher chances
to form links with geographical neighbors of its contacts, without its contacts being linked to these
geographical neighbors.
      In such setting, a first test is similar to the initial idea of Jaffe et al. (1993), and the way of
conducting it is conceptually equivalent to that of Alcácer and Gittelman (2006) and Thompson
(2006). It tests whether applicants are more likely to cite patents developed geographically close
to them than office examiners. A point of enquiry is whether this mechanism is different from the
mechanism we test above, or whether one dominates the other when both are introduced jointly
in a regression. Moreover, the approach can be followed one step further, testing if citations to
geographical neighbors of contacts are more likely. Indeed, while having a purely spatial approach
only allows to proxy links of distance 1 (being close to A who is close to B means one is also close to
B), looking at applicants close to contacts formed through citations gives a proxy for links of distance
2 with a spatial dimension. This test therefore proposes an alternative and more flexible proxy of
link formation than the one used above based purely on patent citations.

        Note: Conditional logit estimations of the determinants of knowledge transfers (equation (1.2)). The
        sample is the set of citations of the randomly selected applicants after 2000, from and to USPTO patents.
        The dependent variable is a dummy equal to 1 when there is an applicant-added citation from patent
        o to patent d. Contact is a dummy equal to 1 when patent d belongs to a contact of the firm. Close
        Firm indicates that patent d belongs to an applicant located less than 5 kilometers away from the origin
        applicant, Cited by Contact that patent d has been cited by a contact of the firm, and Close To Contact
        that the applicant of patent d is located less than 5 kilometers from a contact of the citing applicant.
        “Dest. patent Controls” include the logs of the age of the cited patent, the log of its quality, as well
        as of the technological distance to the citing patent. “Persistence Controls” include dummy variables
        indicating whether a patent has already been cited by the applicant, either through an applicant citation
        or in general, whether the applicant has already been cited, and whether a patent of the same INPADOC
        patent family has already been cited, as well as a dummy accounting for whether a patent has been cited
        by a contact before information availability on AA and EA citations. In columns (4) and (5), the sample is
        halved according to the size of origin patents’ largest applicant, measured as the number of applications
        in the sample: “Small” refers to patents applied for by applicants below the median size, “Large” refers
        to patents applied for by applicants above the median size. Coefficients are exponentiated, standard
        errors refer to these exponentiated coefficients (i.e. coefficients are odds ratios). Standard errors are
        clustered at the citing patent level in all regressions. Significance levels: a p<0.01 b p<0.05 c p<0.1.


    For each firm in our randomly selected sample, we select the set of patents developed by neighbor
firms as patents in which the location of all applicants is less than 5km away.19 We then define a
dummy variable Close Firm taking value one if the cited patent was made by a neighbor firm of the
citing patent’s assignee. We proceed in exactly the same way to define the dummy variable Close
to Contact, meaning we select patents applied for by applicants located less than 5km away.20 The
variable is equal to one when the assignee of the cited patent is close to a contact of the citing firm(s).
    Table 1.3 displays coefficients associated with the variables indicating if applicants are geograph-
ically close to our set of firms (through the dummy variable Close Firm), or geographically close to

     Note that this step is computationally quite demanding, which explains why we select a distance of 5km, which is
lower than what is usually used in this literature.

their contacts (through the dummy variable Close to Contact). As the color association indicates,
these tests are the respective spatial equivalent of the network tests run through the variables Con-
tact Firm and Cited by Contact. It shows that firms are indeed between 5 and 10% more likely
than examiners to cite patents from assignees located less than 5 km from them depending on the
specification. This replicates the results of Alcácer and Gittelman (2006) and Thompson (2006), yet
with a slightly lower coefficient, which decreases once we introduce measures for network links. As
columns 2 to 4 show, applicants also seem 5% more likely to cite patents from assignees located close
to their contacts, and this does not seem to depend as much on origin applicants’ size as the first
effect. Indeed, the effect making applicants more likely to cite neighboring firms hides substantial
heterogeneity in terms of size of origin applicants: while below median size patents are 15% more
likely to cite patents from neighbors, this effect is null for above median size patents. Albeit con-
sistent with our findings in the network test, i.e. that larger firms are less affected by distance, this
may also reflect the fact that the address used for large applicants is likely to be less precise: many
applications are made by headquarters or dedicated entities, hence a spatial disconnect between the
patent’s citations and the applicant’s environment. Excluding very large firms, the coefficient of 1.15
we obtain for the increased likelihood of citations towards neighbors indicates a 15% increase in
probability, which seems reasonably close to the 25% increase obtained by Thompson (2006), con-
sidering the differences in samples and methods used. Surprisingly, the introduction of spatial links
does not really affect the estimated coefficients for network links.
    Contrary to the baseline network results, the estimates presented above do not include the log
of geographical distance between the citing and the cited patent as a control variable. This would
indeed make the test considerably more demanding, as it would test for the existence of non log-
linearities in distance conditional on network measures in applicants’ citation behaviour. Results
shown in Table 1.20 in Appendix indeed show that no such effect exists on average. This however
has to be contrasted, since large firms seem to drive the effect down, while below median size patents
do indeed seem to disproportionately cite close patents relative to examiners. As an additional
robustness check, we conduct a strategy close to the alternative strategy for network search: we use
examiner citations to construct false contacts, and compare subsequent citations towards firms close
to the true contacts relative to the false ones. Table 1.22 in the Appendix shows support for the
existence of link formation toward geographical neighbors of contact firms using this strategy.


4    Theory: Network Origins of the Distance Effect

    To interpret the aggregate consequences of the micro-level empirical findings of section 3, a
model featuring network formation along firms’ life-cycle is warranted. This section develops a
dynamic model able to bridge our finding that knowledge percolates through a network of innovators
from section 3, with the fact that distance hinders aggregate knowledge flows shown in section 2.
    To do so, we adapt a model developed in Chaney (2018a) to the context of knowledge and build
it around the empirical findings shown in section 3. The mechanics are as follow: agents can access
knowledge through their contacts, and start off with initial contacts distributed close to them. Firms
then gain some new contacts as time passes, which are either the contacts of their own contacts

(network search), or agents located close to their contacts (spatial search).21


Model.      We extend the model featured in Chaney (2018a) to introduce some “spatial search” in
addition to the “network search”, consistently with the empirical evidence provided in section 3.4 that
pure spatial forces may be at play. The model is the following. Time is continuous, and infinitely-lived
firms are born with a growth rate γ. Space is infinite and one-dimensional (R), so that coordinates
of any location are a scalar x. When they are born, firms are endowed with a set of contacts of mass
K0 , born at the same time, and distributed around them according to the distribution k0 (x), which
is assumed to be symmetric and to admit a finite second-moment. Each contact provides a firm with
one unit of knowledge. The set of contacts of a firm of age a evolves in three ways:

    • Gain via network search: a firm’s existing contact may reveal one of its own contacts through a
        random Poisson shock of parameter β. This revealed contact joins the set of the firm’s contacts.
        A technical constraint requires that firms can only gain contacts with firms of their cohort. This
        corresponds to the coefficient associated to the variable Cited by Contact in Table 1.2 showing
        that innovators do form links toward contacts of contacts.

    • Gain via spatial search: the firm can directly find new contacts, through a random Poisson
        shock of parameter ρ, in each location where it already has contacts. This means that, going
        from age a to age a + da, the firm picks some new contacts with the exact same spatial dis-
        tribution as the contacts it already has. This corresponds to the coefficient associated to the
        variable Close To Contact in Table 1.3 in our estimations of the spatial test, showing that firms
        get new contacts with the same spatial distribution as their existing contacts.

    • Loss of a contact, also through a Poisson shock of parameter δ.

Based on these three channels, the evolution of ka , the mass of contacts at point x of an aged a firm
writes:

     Note that the idea that young and small firms initially start with localized contacts (as assumed in the model developed
below) has received some empirical support: Almeida and Kogut (1997) looked at innovators in the semi-conductor
industry in the US, and found that small firms were more prone to cite patents developed closer to them than big firms
were.

Proof. See Appendix E.

    These predictions are very intuitive. In a nutshell, this model describes an environment in which
firms will gradually be less and less affected by distance as they grow old: their average contact
is further and further away. In aggregate however, because new firms are born every period with
a constant growth rate and that increases in size are generated by random shocks, this model will
imply a Pareto size distribution, meaning that small firms are considerably more numerous than large
ones. Moreover, because new contacts are further away than old ones, the distance from contacts
will be an increasing function of size.


Comparative Statics.      Partial derivatives of the parameters of interest with respect to ρ are as
follow:

                                          ∂λ       −γ
                                             =              <0
                                          ∂ρ   (ρ + β − δ)2
                                          ∂µ       −β
                                             =              <0
                                          ∂ρ   (ρ + β − δ)2

This means that, when spatial search increases, this generates a decrease in λ, i.e. an increase in the
proportion of large firms relative to small ones. It also generates a decrease in µ, implying that the
difference between the distance at which big and small firms cite drops. In other words, adding this
force to the baseline Chaney (2018a) model predicts a lower value for λ than if network search was
the only way to gain new contacts, as well as a reduced relation between firm size and distance of
citations.
    Similarly, partial derivatives of the parameters of interest with respect to β are:

                                          ∂λ       −γ
                                             =              <0
                                          ∂β   (ρ + β − δ)2
                                          ∂µ      ρ−δ
                                             =              ≶0
                                          ∂β   (ρ + β − δ)2

Thus, the effect on the distribution of firms sizes of an increase in network search is exactly equivalent
to the magnitude of the effect of an increase in spatial search: it makes the tail of the size distribution
thicker, by increasing the rate at which firms get new contacts while leaving unchanged the entry
rate of newborn firms. The sign of the effect of a change in β on µ is, however, undetermined, and
depends on the relative importance of spatial search versus contact destruction. If the latter does less
than compensate spatial search, then the last partial derivative is positive and an increase in network
search would have the consequence of increasing µ, i.e. increasing the sensitivity of citation distance
to innovator size. If, however, δ is large enough in front of ρ such that gains of contacts through
spatial search do not compensate contact losses, then an increase in network search would negatively
affect µ, similarly to an increase in spatial search. In other words, in a context in which spatial search
is too weak to compensate contact loss, an increase in network search will make the distance of firms
citations less dependent on the innovator sizes, while the opposite effect will occur if spatial search
is strong enough to compensate contact loss. This compares with the baseline model without spatial
search in which an increase in network search has an unambiguous negative effect on µ.

Gravity equation Similarly to trade flows in Chaney (2018a), citation flows will exhibit a negative
distance elasticity as long as the following two main conditions hold:

    • Condition 1: Innovator sizes follow a Pareto distribution of shape parameter λ with λ > 1.

    • Condition 2: An increasing power function of parameter µ links the average squared distance
         of a firm’s citations to its size.

These two conditions are exactly the predictions of the above network formation model, therefore
connecting directly our micro findings of section 3 with the motivating fact that distance negatively
affects aggregate knowledge flows shown in section 2. Under these two sufficient conditions,22
knowledge flows are negatively related to distance.
      Under these two conditions, as stated above, small innovative firms are considerably more nu-
merous than large firms, and there is a systematic relation between a firm’s size and the distance of
the citations it makes. In other words, if large firms cite on average further away than small firms,
then citations at long distances mostly come from large firms (firms applying for many patents).
This means that the greater the number of large firms compared to small ones (smaller λ), and the
quicker the distance at which firms cite increases with size (larger µ), the lower the negative impact
of distance on patent citations is in aggregate.


5        Estimation of Aggregate Predictions

      The network formation model presented in the previous section (section 4) provides sufficient
conditions for a negative elasticity of knowledge flows with respect to distance to emerge. These
predictions can be directly tested in the data. We find that they hold well empirically, which gives
credit to the idea that the network formation mechanism that we described underlies the spatial
decay of knowledge flows.


5.1      Pareto distribution of innovator sizes

     The network formation model predicts that the distribution of innovator sizes will be Pareto,

i.e. that F (K) = 1 − KK0 , with λ = ρ+β−δ . We therefore check that a Pareto distribution fits our
data well, and we estimate the shape parameter of this distribution, using the method introduced by
Axtell (2001). We rank innovators by increasing order of size, where size is the number of patent
applications in a given year23 and distribute them in 20 bins of equal log width.24 We compute the
    22
                                                                                                   elasticity

                                                                                          µ    .
   23
      Measuring size in our context is not obvious: although the closest to the model would be to assess it through the
number of outward citations, the information on citations is missing for many patents, the number of citations should be
very correlated with the number of patents, is very dependent on the office rules, and overall yields very noisy results.
Thus, our aim is to find the best measure of innovator size: we use a patent count, where all applications are included,
and not only the first one, to weight “quality” in (Lanjouw et al., 1998).
   24
      There seems to be no established consensus regarding the number of bins that should be used: while Axtell (2001)
uses 30 bins, Chaney (2018a) uses 50. The specificity of patent data is that most firms in our sample have 1 or 2 patent
applications in a given year; thus, if we use too many bins, some bins are actually empty because firms having 1 patent
application fill more than one bin. This leads to some bins being dropped, and may lead to λ and µ being estimated with
a different number of bins.

    The slope of the regression line shown in Figure 1.5 corresponds to our baseline estimate of λ.
The Pareto distribution fits very well our innovator size data (considering the very high R-squared).
Table 1.23 in the Appendix confirms this finding and shows results display little sensitivity to the
number of bins used or the selected patent office. This makes the measured distribution enter the
specific case of a Zipf law, a Pareto distribution with shape parameter equal to 1. In the model,
this implies that the net growth of the mass of contacts should equate the growth rate of the firm
population.
    The economic literature has uncovered a wide class of objects following a power law, which are
as diverse as city sizes, innovator sizes, income distribution, the number of trades per day (Gabaix,
2016), or closer to our object of study the productivity of innovations (Ghiglino, 2012). We add
the size distribution of patenting firms to this class. From the empirical standpoint, the distribution
of firm sizes in general has been shown to follow a Zipf law by Axtell (2001). Moreover, while the
assumption that productivities are Pareto distributed is common in the trade literature, Nigai (2017)
has shown that the left-hand side of the distribution of productivities is closer to log-normal while
the right-hand side fits the Pareto distribution better. In our context, if more innovative firms are also
more productive, it is sufficient to posit that only firms above a certain productivity threshold are able
to innovate, which means left-truncating the productivity distribution, to obtain an innovator sizes
distribution well described by a Zipf law. From the theoretical standpoint, random growth in size
typically generates log-normal distributions (Gibrat, 1931), while it is common to generate power
laws from scale-free network formation processes (e.g. from the model of Albert and Barabási, 2002),



                                                                    42


which also features growth in the number of nodes, and link formation through preferential attach-
ment (which takes the form of network search in the model we use, growth alone being insufficient
to generate a scale-free network).
      If we disaggregate our sample and count patent applications in each year, the Pareto distribution
still provides an excellent fit. Figure 1.7a shows the estimated coefficient of the Pareto distribution
for each year from 1980 to 2010. Note that Zipf law cannot be rejected for almost all of the period
we study. As shown in Figure 1.17 in the Appendix, innovator sizes are also found to be Pareto
distributed when measured using only the patents from one single office, be it the EPO, the JPO or
the USPTO. Similarly, within a given technological field (IPC section), the distribution is also Pareto,
but the shape parameters exhibit some mild differences across sectors.


5.2     Distance of citations as an increasing function of innovator size

      The network model generates a second, more specific feature. It predicts that larger firms are able
to access knowledge generated further away than smaller firms. More precisely, there is a positive
constant elasticity of the average squared distance at which firms cite with respect to their size. To
test whether this holds in our data, we rank firms in increasing order of size,25 and construct 20 bins
of equal log width. We compute the average size of firms in each bin K b and the average squared
distance,26 denoted ∆ b , at which firms in bin b cite. µ is estimated from:


                                              ln[∆ b ] = a + µ ln(K b ) + " b                                           (1.6)

      Figure 1.6 shows that the relationship between the average squared distance at which a firm cites
and its size is well described by an increasing power function (i.e. increasing linear in logs). To the
best of our knowledge, this systematic relationship between a innovator size and its ability to access
more distant ideas is a novel finding in the analysis of patent citations. Tables 1.24, 1.25 and 1.26
in the Appendix show that this positive relationship still holds with a very good fit, when the sample
is restricted to USPTO patents, to applicant citations, and when the number of bins is increased.
      The positive link between innovator size and their ability to access more distant knowledge does
not disappear when we disaggregate the sample by patent office (see Figure 1.18). When running
separate regressions for each IPC section, µ is always found to be positive, and significant for 7
sections out of 8 (see again Figure 1.18). Additionally, the estimated µ is robust to alternative ways
of measuring distance (notably to switching to city to city distances instead of country distances
between their capital cities). Note that the elasticity with respect to innovator size of the average
squared distance for citations is around half of its counterpart for exports. In other words, the ability
to create links with distant firms is less sensitive to size for ideas than for exports.
      A complementary exercise which we conduct is to estimate µ within firms over time, meaning that
we run a simple two-way fixed effects regression at the firm × year, such that µ is estimated from time
variations in innovator size and distance of citations. Using this specification, we also find a positive
significant relationship between these two variables, as shown in Table 1.27 in the Appendix. This
   25
     Size is again defined as the number of applications of the firm.
   26
     In our baseline estimations, the distance of a citation is defined as the distance between the largest city of the country
of each applicant, and intranational citations are excluded, but we show that our results hold for alternative geographic
choices.

(columns 1 and 3) or restrict our attention to applicant-added citations (column 2 and 4), and is
not driven by a time trend, since the inclusion of year fixed effects does not change the estimated
µ. This means that firms getting bigger also tend to cite further away, while firms shrinking would
tend to cite closer. Consistently with the model, we also find a positive link between the age of a
firm and its size. We define age as years since the first patent, and regress the log of innovator size
on its age, with a set of firm fixed effects. We find a semi-elasticity around 0.03 (see Table 1.28 in
the Appendix), meaning each additional year makes an innovator on average 3% larger.
      Taken together, these two findings are consistent with the dynamics of the model: as firms grow
older, they become larger and are able to build links with more distant firms. Interestingly, the
economy described here shares similar features with ones emanating from the Schumpeterian growth
theory (Aghion et al., 2015): the size distribution of firms, where size is assimilated to the number
of their innovations, is highly skewed, and larger firms are older.

order to understand the changes undergone during our period, in an attempt to explain why these
have not implied a decrease in the aggregate distance effect. The context of innovation does not
meet the conditions expressed by Chaney (2018a) to give a closed firm expression of the elasticity of
flows with respect to distance as a function of λ and µ (notably, λ is not always above 1 as required).
However, changes in one parameter keeping the other constant can be interpreted in terms of changes
in the resulting ζ. For instance, decreasing µ all other things equal (including the initial distance of
contacts k0 ) means that the link between distance of citations and size is less stark, therefore large

               the number of patent applications of the firm during the year. The distance is the geographical distance
               between the largest city of the countries of the citing and the cited patent. Standard errors are obtained
               using 100 bootstrap replications.


firms do not cite at much larger distances than small firms do, and the elasticity of flows with respect
to distance should increase.
         Figure 1.7a shows that the shape parameter of the innovator sizes distribution has remained quite
close to 1. Yet, point estimates seem to have increased slightly, going from values clearly below 1 to
values close or above 1. This implies a relative increase in the number of small innovators relative
to large ones. Figure 1.7b shows that the strength of the link between innovator size and distance of
citations has varied a lot over time. µ has strongly decreased over the years: while the elasticity was
around 0.1 in the 80s, it hovers around 0.04 in the 2000s, with a strong decline occurring during
the 90s. This means that the distance at which firms cite has become less and less sensitive to size.
         This drop in the value of µ could be an effect of ICTs: while small firms were very constrained to
get new knowledge in the 1980s, they can now find a share of the new knowledge they need through
internet searches, which makes distance of citations less sensitive to size. In such a case, this would be
associated with a structural change in the spatial distribution of newborn firms: the k0 in the model
would then have higher variance in later years. The alternative explanation of such a decrease in
the magnitude of µ would be that big firms are now less able to access to distant knowledge, which
seems hard to rationalize unless the geography of innovations has changed. Figure 1.8 argues in
favor of the former: on the left-hand side of the graph, the distance at which the small firms cite
has increased in the years 2000s compared to the 1980s and 1990s (while the right-hand side is
estimated with some noise and difficult to interpret with certainty).
         Explaining the stability of the aggregate distance coefficient displayed in Figure 1.1 then requires
an increase in the share of small firms, i.e. an increase in the shape parameter of the Pareto distri-
bution λ. This seems to be verified in Figure 1.7a, although standard errors are too large to reject
equality of these parameters over time. The explanation for the fact that the gravity coefficients on

Predictive power Among other reasons, the changes over time exposed above also have implica-
tions on the predictive power we can gain on the value of ζ, the elasticity of flows with respect to
distance. Several reasons indeed make the model unfit to convincingly predict ζ.
   The first reason originates in the convergence conditions imposed on λ and µ for the model to
deliver a prediction on an asymptotically constant elasticity of flows with respect to distance, as
shown in Chaney (2018a). Indeed, this constant elasticity equal to 1 + 2 λ−1
                                                                          µ arises only under the
conditions that λ > 1 and λ < 1+µ. While the latter condition is often met in our data, the former is
not: λ is generally not significantly different from unity, but λ > 1 can be rejected in many contexts.
Additionally, since λ has to be greater than 1, the predicted value of ζ can only be larger than 1,
which is both conceptually very large and at odds with what we measure.
   A second reason for the poor predictive power is the fact that predicted values of zeta are condi-
tional on a value of k0 , the dispersion of contacts for newborn firms. Yet as stated above, a decrease
in µ in the data could stem either from the fact that large firms cite closer than before, or from the
fact that small firms cite further away. The model fixes k0 , therefore imposing the first interpretation
of a decrease in µ (resulting in an increase in the predicted effect of distance). It is however quite
likely that measured variations in µ will also reflect changes in k0 , which should in contrast decrease
the effect of distance. Therefore, testing the correlation between the predicted and the measured
values of ζ over a dimension of variation (e.g. technological classes) would require homogeneity in
k0 across sectors. This condition is not met in the data, as Figure 1.9 shows: the intercept of µ, which
should correspond to k0 (the squared distance at which the smallest firms cite on average) is very
heterogeneous across technologies. For instance, chemistry and construction appear to have very

similar values of µ, but have very different intercepts, showing that small innovators in chemistry
use knowledge from more distant places than innovators in construction. Similarly, large innova-
tors in operations and transport appear to cite as far as their counterpart in physics and electricity,
but the latter technological classes exhibit a much lower µ because the small innovators in these
technologies already use knowledge generated very far from them. This is noticeable since these
two classes include all innovations relative to semiconductors, electric communication, digital and
optical computing, meaning that small innovators in ICTs manage to escape the negative effect of
distance more easily than innovators in more traditional technologies. The rise of these technologies
may therefore explain the changes observed in the value of µ shown in Figure 1.8. Because of the
changes shown in k0 over time and across sectors, we are however deprived of the two most natural
leeways to test the predictive power of the model on the measured values of ζ.


6    Conclusion

    This paper shows that the negative effect attributed to distance on international knowledge flows
can credibly be explained by the spatial pattern in the dynamics of network formation between
innovators.
    First, we causally test the influence of existing contact links on the network formation between
innovators. Using previous patent citations to build contacts, we show that a firm is more likely to
cite either a patent originating from a contact or cited by a contact than a similar patent from outside
its close network. For identification, we exploit the fact that some citations are added by applicants
while others are added by the office examiners, the union of which provides us with a group of
counterfactual citations under frictionless knowledge circulation. We estimate the effect of a direct
or indirect link on the likelihood of being cited by the applicant itself (versus the likelihood of being
cited by the examiner). We find that firms are 1.5 times more likely than examiners to cite patents

owned by their contacts, yet hiding some heterogeneity between small and large firms. Moreover,
firms are 35% more likely to cite patents that were cited directly by their contacts. These effects are
robust to a wide range of checks.
   Based on this finding, we use and extend the network formation model developed by Chaney
(2018a) to draw aggregate implications from the above phenomenon. In this model, the initial
spatial clustering of an innovators’ contacts tends to vanish over time since innovators gain new, more
distant contacts through network search, i.e. through a contact’s contacts, and spatial search, i.e. gain
of new contacts that are geographically close to an existing contact. Nevertheless, the continuous
arrival of new firms, which are not able to access distant knowledge, maintains an aggregate negative
relationship between distance and knowledge flows.
   We then show that the theoretical aggregate predictions of the model hold remarkably well in
the data. The sizes of innovators - measured as the number of patent applications - are Pareto-
distributed (and even Zipf distributed), and the average squared distance at which innovators cite
is an increasing power function of their size. Moreover, we find the latter relationship to hold both
across firms and within firms over their lifetime. The Zipf distribution of innovator sizes, as well as
the systematic increasing relationship between size and distance at which firms are able to cite, are
novel findings. They allow generating a negative effect of distance on aggregate citation flows: if
small firms are far more numerous than big ones and if they cite relatively closer, the intensity of
flows will naturally depend negatively from distance.
   Interestingly, the network formation mechanism put forward is general enough to encompass
many of the usual explanations of the localization of knowledge spillovers: it is consistent with
formal R&D collaboration agreements and the natural network they generate, but also with expla-
nations based on cultural proximity and common ethnicity (Agrawal et al., 2008; Kerr, 2008), with
linkages with geographical neighbors (e.g. inside clusters), as well as inter-firm mobility of engineers
(Almeida and Kogut, 1999; Breschi and Lissoni, 2009; Serafinelli, 2019), and input-output linkages
(Carvalho and Voigtländer, 2014).

A.3                                     Description of examiner citations

                                   This section examines the PatEX database from USPTO’s Public PAIR data, which records infor-
mation about the examination process at the USPTO, matched with our sample of USPTO patent
applications from Patstat. It reveals the following findings.
                                   Time spent on a patent application by an examiner is substantial: after dropping very occasional
examiners (the ones with less than 5 applications), the average examiner handles 40 patent appli-
cations per year, with the 95th percentile being slightly above 100, meaning that even very busy
examiners deal with two applications in an average working week. This suggests that the citations
added in the process of examination should have been cautiously analyzed. Similarly, examination
is conducted by one person only.
                                   Examiners appear to be very specialized in their field: keeping only the eight technological cen-
ters as they exist today (to avoid counting organizational changes as movements), 78% of examiners
remained their whole career in one of the centers, while 86% of examiners handled patents for less
than 4 of the 589 technological divisions called art units27 over their career.

                                   There appears to be limited habit formation in examiners’ behavior. As Figure 1.13 shows, patents
cited several times by the same examiner also tend to be cited many times by other examiners, even
when we consider only the ones outside the examiner’s art unit (to exclude potential peer-effects).
Looking at the technological distance between the patent application assessed by the examiner and
the patents she cites, as shown in Table 1.5, we find that the first time an examiner cites a patent, the
technological distance is only 1% of a standard deviation lower, or equivalently that each additional
time a patent is cited by a given examiner implies an average increase of technological distance
of .4% of a standard deviation. This means that, while habit formation in the way examiners cite
may exist, it implies very small losses in the accuracy of citations as evidenced by our measure of

Note: The sample is composed of all citations to destination patents cited more than once by the same USPTO examiner.
The dependent variable is the standardized technological distance between the citing and the cited patent (Mahalanobis
distance calculated on IPCs 3 digits). “First citation by examiner” is a dummy variable taking value 1 when a patent is cited
for the first time by an examiner. “Rank of examiner citation” is a variable taking value n when a citation corresponds to the
n th time an examiner cites a patent. Standard errors are clustered at the citing patent level in all regressions. Significance
levels: a p<0.01 b p<0.05 c p<0.1.




A.4     Description of the variables used in Section 2.1.

Age.    Age is simply the difference between the priority date of the citing patent and the priority
date of the cited patent.


Quality. We build a proxy for the quality of each patent by regressing the number of citations this
patent received on a set of fixed effects absorbing the effects of technological classes (IPC 3 digits),
priority year and office.28 In order to use log-transformed values in the regressions, we shift all
values by the absolute value of the minimum to have only positive values. This is not a problem
since it is a control variable and that we do not interpret the associated coefficient.


Geographical Distance. Spatial distance is determined based on the cities of the assignees of o
and d. In the case where there are several applicants located in different cities, we take the mode of
the different cities, or we randomly choose the city of one of the applicants if there is no mode.


Technological Distance. Additionally to the previous variables, we build a measure of technolog-
ical distance between the citing and the cited patents based on the IPC classes in which it has been
filed. The origin of this approach can be traced back to the seminal paper of Jaffe et al. (1993).
   28
      To include IPC 3 digits fixed effects, we need to assign a single IPC3 digit of each patent (a patent may belong to
several IPC 3 digits, whereas our strategy requires that each patent is associated with one single IPC3 digit). To determine
the main IPC 3 digit of a patent, we consider all the IPC 6 digits of this patent, each of which corresponding to a single
IPC 3 digits, and find the mode of IPC 3 digit based on this.

It has later been refined by Thompson and Fox-Kean (2005) and Murata et al. (2014). The use of
Mahalanobis distance between patents as a way to calculate technological distances between them
is a valid approach, as confirmed by the work of Bloom et al. (2013).

Note: Logit and conditional logit estimations of the determinants of knowledge transfers (applicant-added citations),
considering only citations found in the set of examiner-added citations. The sample is the set of examiner citations of
the randomly selected applicants after 2000, recorded on USPTO patents only, from patents containing at least a citation
in the overlap of examiner and applicant citations. The dependent variable is a dummy equal to 1 when there is an
applicant-added citation of patent d by patent o. Contact is a dummy equal to 1 when patent d belongs to a contact of
the firm. Cited by Contact is a dummy equal to 1 when patent d has been cited by a contact of the firm. “Several Cit.”
is a dummy equal to 1 when patent d is cited several times by the origin applicant from the init. year on. Coefficients
are odds-ratios (exponentiated), standard errors refer to these exponentiated coefficients. Standard errors are clustered
at the citing patent level in all regressions. Significance levels: a p<0.01 b p<0.05 c p<0.1.

The sample is the set of citations of the randomly selected applicants grouped by Orbis head of group identifier, recorded
on USPTO patents only. The dependent variable is a dummy equal to 1 when there is an applicant-added citation of patent

of the names we enter to firms in the database.29 The matched firms are a priori the largest ones,
thus the ones which are most likely to have subsidiaries. We spot within-group citations through
firms which have the same parent company as their contacts (as of September 2018). We find that
remaining within-group citations are indeed rare: we find only 0.2% of links to be within group.
We also conduct the same regressions as in the baseline merging applicants and their contacts when
they belong to the same group. Table 1.13 shows that consolidating assignees and contacts at the
group level does not harm our results.

Alternative Test. The sample is the set of patents that could potentially be cited, i.e. patents
granted after 2000 to the true or fake contacts. The dependent variable is a dummy variable taking
value one if the patent was actually cited by the random set of firms, zero otherwise. We want to
know whether this binary choice is affected by the fact that the patent belongs to a true contact as
opposed to a fake one, i.e. whether a dummy variable indicating that the patent belongs to a true
contact has a positive and significant effect. This dummy variable is defined at the citing firm ×
destination patent level, which is therefore the unit of observation we adopt for our analysis.
    This strategy has some drawbacks compared to the baseline one. Since citations are only observed
when these patents cited either by applicants or examiners get cited after 2000 by origin applicants,
the sample is composed of all the cited patents rather than all the citations, which does not allow

to run a conditional logit as before. Indeed, it implies conducting the tests at the citing applicant-
cited patent pair level rather than at the citing patent-cited patent pair level. For this reason, we
run a simple logit, with standard errors clustered at the citing applicant level. Another drawback,
although minor, is that it implies conducting both tests on very different samples (all patents from
contacts, either true or control for Test 1, and all citations, either applicant or examiner added, in all
contacts’ applications in Test 2). To be consistent with the baseline identification strategy, in which
running a conditional logit implies dropping any citation without at least one applicant added and
one examiner added citation, we drop the citations which do not meet this criterion in the following
tests.

in the left panel of Table 1.14, and are also about 30% more likely to cite patents truly cited by their
contacts than patents cited by examiners of their contacts, as shown in the right panel of Table 1.14.


Initialization year.       Table 1.15 provides results similar to the baseline, changing the initialization
year from 2000 to 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2005. Results hold in all these situations, and coefficients
show little sensitivity to changes in initialization year as well as to the implied re-sampling (since
the random selection of a third of all applicants is conducted again for each year).

Firm level results for network search. Because large firms display lower direct network effects
and make the bulk of citations, we conduct the same tests at the firm level, to provide average
effects on firms rather than on patent applications. To do so, we take the mean of all our variables
(dependent and independent) by firm over the whole period and by firm-year. We add two variables
for the number of patent applications and the number of citations made. We then run a fractional
logit regression, which is adapted to dependent variables resulting of a mean of realizations of a
binary variable. We present results as odds ratio, which can therefore be interpreted like other
robustness results, in Table 1.17.

Note: Fractional Logit estimations of the determinants of knowledge transfers (applicant-added citations), aggregated at
the firm or firm and year levels. The sample is the set of randomly selected firms with patents in and after 2000, recorded
on USPTO patents only. The dependent variable is the share of applicant-added citations over the period considered. Nbr of
patents and Nbr of citations are sums of patent applications and citations by the firm over the period considered. All other
covariates are similar to the ones found in the baseline test shown in Table 1.2, yet averaged at the relevant observation
unit level. Coefficients are odds-ratios (exponentiated), standard errors refer to these exponentiated coefficients. Standard
errors are clustered at the citing patent level in all regressions. Significance levels: a p<0.01 b p<0.05 c p<0.1.



Placebo tests. Since the two different types of citations (AA and EA) exist at three different levels
in our tests (contact initialization, citations by contacts, citations after 2000), it is easy to run Placebo
tests, building false contacts or false citations by contacts. We invert applicant and examiner-added
citations: this way, we build a false set of contacts as the applicants cited in 2000 by examiners, and
a false set of patents cited by contacts as the patents cited by the examiners of these false contacts.
We then make sure that none of these false links overlaps with the true links constructed in the
above baseline strategy, which would naturally make our tests spuriously positive. We run the same
regressions as the ones presented in Table 1.2. Table 1.18 shows that the effects of our network
variables disappear once controls on observable characteristics are introduced, which is the desired
result.

Note: Conditional logit estimations of the determinants of knowledge transfers (applicant-added citations), considering
only citations found in the set of examiner-added citations. The sample is the set of examiner citations of the randomly
selected applicants after 2000, recorded on USPTO patents only, from patents containing at least a citation in the overlap of
examiner and applicant citations. The dependent variable is a dummy equal to 1 when there is an applicant-added citation
of patent d by patent o. Contact is a dummy equal to 1 when patent d belongs to a contact of the firm. Cited by Contact
is a dummy equal to 1 when patent d has been cited by a contact of the firm. “Several Cit.” is a dummy equal to 1 when
patent d is cited several times by the origin applicant from the init. year on. Coefficients are odds-ratios (exponentiated),
standard errors refer to these exponentiated coefficients. Standard errors are clustered at the citing patent level in all
regressions. Significance levels: a p<0.01 b p<0.05 c p<0.1.

Note: Conditional logit estimations of the determinants of knowledge transfers (equation (1.2)). The sample is the set of
citations of the randomly selected applicants after 2000, from and to USPTO patents. The dependent variable is a dummy
equal to 1 when there is an applicant-added citation from patent o to patent d. Contact is a dummy equal to 1 when
patent d belongs to a contact of the firm. Close Firm indicates that patent d belongs to an applicant located less than 5
kilometers away from the origin applicant, Cited by Contact that patent d has been cited by a contact of the firm, and
Close To Contact that the applicant of patent d is located less than 5 kilometers from a contact of the citing applicant.
“Dest. patent Controls” include the logs of the age of the cited patent, the log of its quality, as well as of the geographical
distance and of the technological distance to the citing patent. “Persistence Controls” include dummy variables indicating
whether a patent has already been cited by the applicant, either through an applicant citation or in general, whether the
applicant has already been cited, and whether a patent of the same INPADOC patent family has already been cited, as well
as a dummy accounting for whether a patent has been cited by a contact before information availability on AA and EA
citations. In columns (4) and (5), the sample is halved according to the size of origin patents’ largest applicant, measured
as the number of applications in the sample: “Small” refers to patents applied for by applicants below the median size,
“Large” refers to patents applied for by applicants above the median size. Coefficients are exponentiated, standard errors

Alternative strategy for the spatial search test This version of the spatial search test mimics the
alternative strategy pursued for the network search test: it compares the frequency of citations after
2000 toward patents developed by applicants located close to true contacts, to those toward patents
developed by applicants located close to false contacts, defined as applicants cited by examiners in
2000. The sample is therefore a set of origin applicant - cited patent dyads, with the dependent
variable being a dummy variable taking value 1 when the patent is located close to a true contact,
and the covariate of interest being a dummy variable taking value 1 when the patents gets cited by
the origin applicant after 2000.

Using the Fourier transform of f a yields a simple product instead of a convolution product, which
yields that f a converges towards a Laplace distribution when age grows large (Proposition 2 in
Chaney, 2018a).
    One can then derive the endogenized conditions allowing to get a constant elasticity of flows
with respect to distance. The distribution of innovator sizes is simply derived from the ODE: Ka =
                                                                        1

the firm population being equal to γ, this means that the fraction of firms having less than K contacts
writes:                                                                             γ
                                                                         −

Thus, the distribution of innovator sizes is Pareto, with a shape parameter λ =                       ρ+β−δ .
    The average squared distance at which firms cite others, ∆a , is the second moment of the nor-
malized density of contacts f a . Following exactly the steps of the demonstration in Chaney (2018a),
                                                                                    1
∆a = ∆0 eβ a . Plugging the previous expression e a = ( K0a ) ρ+β−δ , this yields:

This paper documents the effect of information frictions on trade using a historical large-scale im-
provement in the transmission of news: the emergence of global news agencies. The information
available to potential traders became more abundant, was delivered faster and at a cheaper price
between countries covered by a news agency. Exploiting differences in the timing of telegraph open-
ings and news agency coverage across pairs of countries, we are able to disentangle the pure effect
of information from the effect of a reduction in communication costs. Panel gravity estimates re-
veal that bilateral trade increased by 30% more for pairs of countries covered by a news agency and
connected by a telegraph than for pairs of countries simply connected by a telegraph.



1       Introduction

    Over the course of the XIXth century, international trade flows experienced an unprecedented
rise. Recent contributions (Steinwender, 2018; Juhász and Steinwender, 2018) highlighted the key
role of the telegraph in explaining this “First Globalization” (on top of the “usual suspects”, namely
changes in trade policy and lower transport costs1 ). However, an improvement in the communica-
tion technology, such as the one studied in these papers, could affect international trade through
two channels. Firstly, it reduces search frictions: it’s less costly to find buyers or sellers for a specific
product, and to coordinate with them. Secondly, it increases the quantity and quality of informa-
tion available to potential traders. This information channel seems to have been overlooked by the
literature, despite its expected relevance as a determinant of export and import decisions: for the
exporters, knowledge of the foreign market characteristics (market size, price, trade costs, demand
shifters) is of prime importance, while for the importers, the sourcing choice is determined by the
information available on price and quality from different markets.

    The specific context of the XIXth century provides a unique opportunity to disentangle the two
above-described mechanisms. Indeed, this period witnessed the birth of global news agencies, which
systematically collected and transmitted information across borders, so that, for the first time, news
became widely available from almost all parts of the globe, with sharply reduced delays. News
agencies are wholesalers of information: they gather news and sell them to governments, businesses,
and newspapers.2 On top of more conventional subjects such as diplomacy and politics, providing
their customers with commercial news was an important part of the business model of these news
agencies. Moreover, the three largest news agencies quickly syndicated into an efficient cost-sharing
organization: each of them was given a monopoly over a set of countries, and in exchange committed
to share information on these countries with the other news agencies. The sharing of information
among the three global news agencies was truthfully enforced, since it ensured that they would stay
ahead of the competition. Therefore, being covered by a global news agency meant becoming part
of an international network of news sharing, including commercial news.
    The development of international news agencies was deeply intertwined with the construction
of an international telegraph network: news agencies relied on the telegraph to communicate and
often contributed to its expansion. The telegraph represented a considerable improvement upon
previous communication technologies,3 allowing for shorter and less volatile transmission delays.
Even though it made communications easier, it did not provide a centralized and reliable source of
business information. Indeed, telegraphic messages were private, and it was therefore possible to
restrict access to some chosen users. On the other hand, news agencies collected, gathered and sold
information that could then be accessed by anyone at a low cost: the end of XIXth century was the
period of penny papers and mass media consumption. In other words, in the absence of a global news
agency, telegraphs reduced only the communication frictions, without much effect on the amount of
information available to the public. We use this distinction between easily enforceable restrictions
of access on the telegraph communications and the quasi-public nature of newspaper information
to disentangle the effects of reduced communication costs from the effects of improved information
access, a separation that previous studies were unable to make.
    The telegraph and the news agencies did not cover all pairs of countries simultaneously. The suc-
cess of the telegraph was immediate, but the cost of the infrastructure and technical factors implied
that not all the countries could be quickly connected. Similarly, the global news agencies did not
expand their operations to the entire world immediately. They started by sharing Europe and then
gradually increased the scope of their syndication agreement through contracts struck in 1859, 1867,
1876, 1889 and 1902. This sequential entry of country pairs into the telegraph and news agencies
networks is key for our identification strategy, because it allows us to estimate a panel data version
of the gravity equation, meaning that on top of the usual origin and destination time varying fixed
effects, we can include country-pair fixed effects, which control for any time-unvarying characteristic
of the two countries.
    News agencies collected and sold information in a country based on the expected profits from
    2
       Newspapers were the main channel of information at the time, they became widely available, and relatively cheap,
so that any information published in a newspaper can be considered as public information. In the very competitive
environment that prevailed on the press market, it would have been too expensive for these numerous newspapers to
collect news from abroad on their own, so they had to rely on news agencies to obtain these news.
     3
       Before the invention of the telegraph, mail had to be transported carrying on steamships, railways or horses, which
in some situations implied months of delay

serving this country, which in turn may be related to future trade flows. To alleviate the concerns
arising from this situation, we use the inclusion of the country into the global news agencies syn-
dication agreement as our measure of news agency coverage. We argue that it accurately reflects
the entry in the global news sharing network, since it creates a clear incentive for a global news
agency to start covering the country: before being granted exclusivity on a market, a global news
agency could decide to sell and collect news, but the exploitation was less likely to be profitable in
a competitive situation than in an organized monopoly. Moreover, the extensions of the agreement
never concerned one single country, they always included groups of countries, usually of the same
geographic region, which suggests that the date of entry into the agreement had more to do with
negotiations between the news agencies than with expected trade flows, and that many countries
started being covered as a by-product of the agreement rather than for their anticipated economic
importance.
   Our approach to capture the effect of the information channel is therefore to focus on the inter-
action between telegraph connections and news agency coverage: while the effect of the telegraph
alone can be attributed to the sole decrease in communication costs, the interacted term specifically
isolates the contribution of an improved access to news between the two covered countries. The
effect is sizable: we estimate the value of trade flows to increase by an additional 30% when two
countries are included in the global network of news diffusion, on top of being connected by a tele-
graph. Our results also corroborate estimates from previous studies that documented a positive effect
on trade of the telegraph: we find that, even in the absence of coverage by a global news agency,
trade flows increase by 40% when two countries become connected by a telegraph. However, news
agencies, in the absence of telegraph, do not trigger any significant increase in trade, suggesting that
they were unable to operate at full efficiency when an appropriate communication technology was
not available.
   These results hold when we control for colonial ties, and data on French tariffs suggest that
they are not driven by correlated changes in trade policy. Moreover, we use indirect connections
as sources of plausibly more exogenous variations in our explanatory variables. For country pairs
that became indirectly linked after the opening of a telegraph line, as for instance Chile and Egypt
in 1874, the timing of opening is unlikely to be related to bilateral expected trade flows. Similarly,
for the news agencies, if potential traders lobby to include some countries in the cartel agreement
based on a perceived high trade potential, it should mostly happen in country pairs in which one of
the countries is the headquarter of the news agency, since it is easier to influence a domestic firm
than a foreign one. Coverage of other country pairs, as for instance Argentina and New-Zealand in
1876, can be seen as an unintended by-product of the expansion. Leaving aside the direct telegraph
connections and the country pairs where one country hosts the headquarter of the news agency, we
still find a significant positive trade effect of the interaction between news agency and telegraph.
   We then analyze the time dynamics of the effect through an event-study, and find a progressive
increase in its magnitude, which slowly rises up to thirty years after the dyads are connected, a
picture consistent with a slow constitution of business networks between the countries that benefited
from an improved access to information on each others. Finally, we provide evidence supporting the
hypothesis that the trade effect is indeed driven by an increase in the quantity of information available
on foreign countries. First, we document an increase in trade volatility after the connection, in line

with the findings of Steinwender, 2018. This is consistent with a better ability of traders to adapt to
market conditions. Second, using data on French newspapers, we find an increase in the presence
of a country in the articles once this country benefits from a telegraph connection and from a news
agency coverage.
   This paper builds on a large literature documenting the effect of information frictions on various
economic outcomes, starting with a reduction in price dispersion (Jensen, 2007; Ejrnæs and Persson,
2010). Linking this literature with international trade, Allen (2014) shows that, on top of the usual
effect on price dispersion, a decrease in information frictions positively affects the volume of trade.
More recent approaches to incorporate information frictions in trade models include Dasgupta and
Mondria (2018) and Lenoir et al. (2020). Empirically, a negative link between trade flows and
communication costs is established by Malgouyres et al. (2020), who make use of the sequential
arrival of high speed internet in French cities. Unlike our approach, these papers however think of
information frictions either as search costs or as a mixture of search costs and constrained information
set, and do not attempt to distinguish these two dimensions.
   Our work highlights the importance in explaining export decisions of the information set available
to firms, a dimension that the literature recently started exploring. Indeed, trade decisions crucially
rely on the expectation the firm forms about the profits it will earn by serving the foreign market.
While perfect foresight is commonly assumed (firms perfectly predict the profits from exporting),
Dickstein and Morales (2018) acknowledge that firms actually use only a restricted set of observable
variables to assess their expected profits, and study the consequences of enlarging this set of variables.
Consistently with our results, they find that more information results in more exports.
   Other contributions have explored the economic consequences of the expansion of the telegraph
network in the XIXth century. Our results complement the work of Juhász and Steinwender (2018),
who document an increase in trade flows following the opening of telegraph lines, especially for
goods whose characteristics are easily codifiable, suggesting that these openings decreased commu-
nication costs. They are also in line with recent work by W2020, who finds a positive effect of
telegraph lines connecting the UK with other countries on financial capital flows from the UK to
these countries. He shows that this effect is mainly driven by the “newspaper channel”, without
explicitly considering the role of news agencies. We also build on the seminal paper of Steinwender
(2018), who demonstrates that the transatlantic telegraph led to price convergence in the cotton
market, and to a better adaptation to demand shocks. She mentions the importance of the “Reuter’s
telegram” provided to traders in the exchanges, but is unable to separate the contribution of these
telegrams from the one of other communications allowed by the telegraph. Additionally, her work
focuses on UK-US flows while we adopt a broader scope, which allows to further control for potential
endogeneity by separating direct and indirect connections.
   The importance of the press as a vector of public information is the subject of a large litera-
ture. However, to our knowledge, there is no previous work on the importance of news agencies as
providers of valuable economic information. The literature on news agencies has focused on indus-
trial organization aspects of the news agencies syndication agreement. Wolff (1991) describes the
historical evolution of the news agency industry. Bakker (2014) explains how their business model
was designed to answer the specificity of the news market: it provided a solution to the Arrow in-
formation paradox (buyers want to know the information in order to determine how much they are

willing to pay, but once the information is revealed, they don’t need to pay anymore).
      In the next section, we present the historical context of our analysis, and our data. Section 3
details our main results, followed by some robustness checks in section 4. In section 5, we pro-
vide evidence that the effect we find can indeed be attributed to an increase in the circulation of
information.


2       Context and data

2.1     Context

The creation of an international telegraph network The first telegraph system implemented at a
significant scale is the optical telegraph of Claude Chappe, which used blades or paddles to transmit
information between towers (semaphore telegraph). It was mostly adopted in France where, in the
first half of the XIXth century, all major cities were linked together, but had little commercial use
and international connections. This is why we focus on the electrical telegraph, that appeared in the
1830s.4 , and quickly became the dominant communication technology, as witnessed by the spectac-
ular growth of the network, both domestically5 and internationally. The total length of telegraphic
wires reached 7 millions km in 1913, and the number of messages exchanged followed a similar
pattern, rising sharply from 28 millions telegrams sent in 1865 to 528 millions in 1913.
      For long-distance lines, the preferred technology was the submarine cable, because it avoided
having to negotiate with countries crossed by the line. The first successful international submarine
cable linked France and the UK in 1851. Governments quickly recognized the importance of the
telegraph for international communications and soon started cooperating within multinational in-
stances: the German-Austrian Telegraph Union in 1851, the Western European Telegraph Union in
1855, and finally the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 1865, that still operates today
as a UN agency. International conventions were adopted to ensure the smoothness of transmissions.
For instance, in 1865, the Morse code was chosen for all international communications.
      The telegraph was a major improvement upon the former communication technologies. It was
therefore immediately adopted by private agents to conduct their business operations, as highlighted
by Wenzlhuemer (2013, p.84): “from its very inception, the telegraph was intimately connected with
the world of business, finance and trade”. Nevertheless, its use was very expensive, and therefore
reserved to wealthy individuals and firms, governments, and news agencies.


The rise of global news agencies The emergence of news agencies is intimately linked to the
sharp rise in newspapers diffusion, that made the press the dominant channel of information at the
time. The first news agency appeared in 1832 and was named after its creator, Charles-Louis Havas.
The success of Havas, which quickly established a monopoly on its domestic market (France)6 and
started expanding its activity to foreign markets, triggered the creation of competing news agencies.
Two former Havas employees, Bernhard Wolff and Paul Julius Reuter, started their own business,
creating respectively the Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau (1849) in Germany (henceforth referred to
    4
     The first functioning line, by Cooke and Wheatstone, was built in 1839 between London and a suburbs town.
    5
     For instance, in France, the length of the domestic telegraph network was 3540 km in 1852 and 42986 km in 1870.
   6
     In 1860, 9 out of 10 Parisian newspapers were subscribers of the French international news agency Havas and for
almost all of them it was the most important source of content (M1997).

as “Wolff”) and Reuters (1851) in the UK, which quickly gained contracts with newspapers outside
of their domestic market. In the 1850s, the market for international news is therefore an oligopoly
with three major players : Havas, Reuters and Wolff. These three incumbents quickly understood
that more profit could be made by colluding, i.e. by avoiding duplicate costs of news production in
some countries, and avoiding competition in some markets. This led to the birth of the international
news cartel in 1859.
   The main component of the 1859 agreement is that each agency was granted a monopoly position
in some countries, meaning that no competitor could sell news to the press (or to local news agencies)
in these countries. For instance, Havas was the only agency allowed to sell news in Spain, Reuters
and Wolff agreed to voluntarily restrain from contracting in this country. However, a key dimension
of the agreement is that the news agencies committed to share without fees information coming from
their exclusivity zone. Coming back to the Spanish example, this means that Havas had to send the
news coming from Spain to the two other cartel members. Moreover, to prevent the appearance of
any serious competitor, the three colluding news agencies agreed to communicate only with each
other, they could not sell news to another competing news agency. Finally, they pledged to develop
the telegraphic infrastructure.
   This first agreement mostly concerned only European territories, the rest of the world remained
fair game. News agencies were free to collect and sell information in the neutral territories, but there
was no systematic exchange of information between them for these territories. But over time, the
agreement was reshaped to incorporate new markets that the news agencies deemed profitable. The
main extensions occurred in 1867, 1876, 1889 and 1902. On each occasion, new countries were
added to the cartel. Table 2.5 (in the appendix) indicates the countries that were added by each
cartel agreement. Additionally, two news agencies joined the cartel: AP in 1876 and the Korrbureau
in 1889. The cartel slowly dislocated in the aftermath of WWI. After the conflict, Wolff lost its
territories, which were shared between the still highly cooperative duo Reuters-Havas. But AP and
the other US news agencies (United Press and International News Service) put more pressure on the
historic European duo. In the 1927 cartel agreement, many countries became shared territories. The
early 1930s were the final blow to the cartel, which officially ceased to operate in 1934. Nowadays,
the market is still an oligopoly, with Reuters and AP by far the biggest players and AFP (former
Havas) as the third player.
   With the news agency cartel, for the first time, a systematic collection and transmission of infor-
mation across countries is in place. Even though the cartel reduced competition in each local market,
it made the coverage of the country profitable (A2013; Bakker, 2014). The cartel organization also
implied a level of information sharing across the global news agencies that arguably would not have
been reached under a more competitive system. Indeed, news agencies really shared the news col-
lected in their exclusive geographical areas. In some cases cooperation was even higher, Reuters and
Havas entered into a joint-purse agreement in 1870. According to Bakker (2014) and A2013, this
organization allowed for an increase in the coverage area, quality and quantity of information. The
formal inclusion in the cartel matters since, even though a neutral territory could be served by a
news agency, this situation was unlikely given that the market was less likely to be profitable.
   It is important to keep in mind that the news agencies were private businesses, under no gov-
ernment mandate. Even though there may have been pressures from their domestic governments,

especially during periods of conflict, profit maximization remained their primary objective. As none
of the news agencies was State-owned, the decision to add a country in the cartel was not directly
taken by governments. This does not mean that countries are added independently from diplomatic
or economic considerations, but it implies that the costs and benefits for the news agency is likely to
be a key driver of the decision. The case of South-America is a particularly good example: South-
America, at the time more economically and politically linked to Great-Britain, was given to Havas
to compensate for Reuters getting large territories in Asia.

    As figure 2.1 illustrates, newspapers used the global news agencies as their main, and often sole,
source of foreign information. Indeed, it was too costly for each newspaper to collect foreign news
on its own.7 They could either be direct subscribers to the international news agencies services, or
clients of a national news agency which in turn relied on a global news agencies for foreign news.
Government or private organizations could also subscribe to foreign news services from the global
news agency serving their country.


News agencies and telegraph complement each other The reduction in information friction is
fully realized when two countries are both covered by a news agency and linked by a telegraph. In
the absence of a telegraph line, news agencies do not have the possibility to send news swiftly from
one country to another. Conversely, in the absence of news agencies, information can flow among
privileged users, but not systematically and with the large audience reached by the newspapers.
    Because the telegraph was at the core of the news agency operations, the geographic extensions
of the cartel coincided with the development of the telegraph network. The motto of Paul Julius
Reuter was clear: “Follow the cable”.8 The cartel started by dividing Europe where the telegraph
network was quite dense. Then South America and Australia were included in 1876, a few years after
being linked to Europe by submarine cables (in 1874 for South America and 1872 for Australia). It
does not however imply that all countries added to the cartel were already connected by a telegraph.9

      Even though a handful of newspapers had foreign correspondents in some specific locations for which they believed
their readership would ask for very detailed reports, the cost was too high for this practice to be common. Only a few
newspapers could afford foreign correspondents and these correspondents were often sent temporarily to cover big events
(A2010b).

The telegraph provided the speed, reliability and privacy necessary to the news agencies. The link
between news agencies an the telegraph is so tight that they were often referred to as “telegraphic
news agencies”, and sometimes even played an active role in the construction of new telegraph
lines.10
      Without the news agencies, a systematic and efficient transmission of information cannot take
place, and the impact of the telegraph is restricted to its use as a communication device for those
that can afford it. Indeed, sending telegrams was very expensive11 and therefore de facto reserved to
the most important and well established traders, while the press was relatively cheap and accessible
to any potential trader. The role of newspapers as provider of public information is explicitly ac-
knowledged by Ejrnæs and Persson (2010): “A flourishing commercial press turned what used to be
exclusively or privately held knowledge into publicly accessible information. While the larger mer-
chants’ houses had access to telegraph transmission directly, others relied on ‘cable news’ reported
in the press.”
      In fine, thanks to the telegraph, news agencies were able to transmit information considerably
faster than before, especially for very distant countries. In figure 2.2, we plot the average delay be-
tween the date of an event and the date of publication of this event in the Time, a London newspa-
per. The dramatic drop in transmission times between London and South America coincides with the
opening of the 1874 telegraph between Europe and South America. Australia was finally connected
with Europe in 1872. Both South America and Australia entered the coverage of news agencies in
1876. From 1880 onwards, information is shared within days, compared with months a few decades
ago.


2.2     Data

Trade data: Information on historical bilateral trade flows comes from the TRADHIST database
(Fouquin and Hugot, 2016), which combines data from previous databases with novel information
extracted from primary sources (manuscripts from the customs archives). It also contains several
bilateral variables linked to trade frictions, such as distance. On top of its extensive coverage of
past trade flows, TRADHIST has the desirable feature that it gives preference to importer reported
data, when available, which ensures higher accuracy. We nevertheless had to make two substantial
modifications to the original data. First, because our analysis relies heavily on time variation, it was
crucial to ensure consistency over time of the countries, so we grouped them according to the largest
existing legal entity over the period. For instance, Sweden and Norway formed a single Kingdom
until 1905, at which point Norway became an independent country, so we gathered them into a
single entity, “Sweden-Norway”. We obtained the trade flows of the so-formed entities by summing
the trade flows of their components: trade flows between “Sweden-Norway” and Denmark after
1905 are the sum of trade flows between Sweden and Denmark, and trade flows between Norway
and Denmark. Second, we re-coded the variables indicating bilateral colonial ties to ensure higher
   10
       For instance, the transatlantic telegraph was built with the guarantee by Reuters to bring a “considerable volume of
business” (Unesco, 1952, p.153.), and Bielsa (2008) explains that news agencies “have been instrumental in the creation
of the material infrastructures for the production and circulation of information and in the development of worldwide
networks, starting with the telegraph, which, in the second half of the nineteenth century became the first system for
global communications”
    11
       For instance sending a 10 word transatlantic telegram in 1866 corresponded one fifth of the annual wage of a US
skilled worker.

accuracy.
   Our analysis starts in 1850, nine years prior to the first cartel agreement (1859) and fifteen years
after the creation of the first news agency (Havas, 1835). It ends in 1914, since World War I is
known to have significantly disrupted the trade patterns, and the cartel agreements were de facto
less binding after 1918, even though they still formally existed. Over this period (1850-1914), five
cartel agreements were struck : in 1859, 1867, 1876, 1889 and 1902. Our baseline unit of analysis is
a directed pair of countries, i.e. a combination importer-exporter (France -> Uruguay for instance).
Throughout the paper, we often refer to these pairs of countries as dyads. The country of origin is
indexed by o, and the destination country by d.


News agency data:                   We hand-coded the geographic coverage of the news agency cartel based on
information provided in Wolff (1991). More precisely, we defined a dummy variable N ewsAg enc yod t
taking value 1 when the importer and the exporter are covered by a news agency participating to the
international news exchange agreements. This bilateral variable is not directed: if N ewsAg enc yod t =
1, then N Ad ot = 1. Colonies are not systematically mentioned in the cartel agreements, so that it’s
hard to tell whether they were actually covered by a news agency or not. Therefore, in our baseline
specification, we adopt the conservative approach of setting our N A dummy to 1 only for countries
whose status is explicitly stated in Wolff (1991). In figure 2.3, we plot the number of countries
mentioned in the cartel agreements, and the number of dyads in which both countries are covered
by a news agency. As expected, the coverage increases over time, and more specifically rises sharply
after each extension of the cartel agreements. We notice a big jump after the 1876 agreement, easily
explained by the fact that at this date many countries were added to the cartel (South America
and large parts of Asia). More descriptive statistics on news agency coverage are available in the
appendix, figure 2.14.

Telegraph data: Data on international telegraph links comes from two sources. For the submarine
telegraph cables, we rely on the Journal Télégraphique, a monthly publication by the International
Telegraph Union (ITU). In some issues, an appendix is available with an exhaustive list of the sub-
marine cables in use and the date at which they started operating12 . This data was collected by
Roland Wenzlhuemer, who kindly accepted to share it with us. The last nomenclature dates back to
1903, before the end of our sample, but at this time the main submarine cables had already been laid
down, and most of the countries were already telegraphically connected. Regarding the terrestrial
telegraphic lines, no such nomenclature is available, so we had to rely on the visual analysis of maps
from the “Bureau international des administrations télégraphiques”, digitized and made available by
the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). The list of the maps we used is available in the appendix,
along with one example of such maps (figure 2.9). The first map dates back to 1856 and the last
one to 1912. Finally in order to start our sample in 1850, we use the list of the first international
telegraphic lines from Wolff (1991).
                  We define a dummy variable Di r ec t Tel e g r aphod t taking value one if a telegraph links directly
country o and country d at date t. For the submarine cables, we know for sure the first year in which
the two countries are linked since the construction dates are given in the nomenclatures. For the
terrestrial cables, we assume that Di r ec t Tel e g r aphod t = 0 until the first time we see the telegraph
on a map. To clarify, the first telegraph between Chile and Argentina was built in 1871.13 We first
see it on the 1875 map, so we code Di r ec t Tel e g r aphARG,C H L,t = 0 until t = 1874. Nevertheless,
given the relatively small time span between each map, the imprecision should be small. Since
telegraphs can always be used in both directions, the link is symmetric, so Di r ec t Tel e g r aphod t =

Di r ec t Tel e g r aphd ot . Based on the direct connections data, we build a dummy variable indicating
whether any pair of countries is indirectly connected, meaning that the two countries are connected
either directly or via one or many intermediary countries, i.e. they belong to the same connected
sub-graph. For instance, if Di r ec t Tel e g r aphok = 1 and Di r ec t Tel e g r aphkd = 1, then Tel od = 1
even if Di r ec t Tel e g r aphod = 0. In more formal terms, two countries o and d are considered as
indirectly connected if there exists at least one path of any length n that connects o to d.
                    Figure 2.4 depicts the number of countries with at least one international telegraph connection
(left-hand side) and the number of dyads connected by the telegraph (right-hand side). We distin-
guish between the dyads connected by a submarine cable, the dyads directly connected (by land or
submarine cables) and the dyads that are directly or indirectly connected. In all cases, the number
of connections increases, but the number of direct connections lags far behind the total number of
connections. This is due to the network structure: adding a new direct link is likely to create more
than one indirect link. Appendix figure 2.13 provides more descriptive statistics on the evolution
over time of the number of telegraph connections.
                    This measure of telegraphic connection within a dyad has some drawbacks. First, it does not
give any idea of the quality, and speed of the telegraphic connection between countries. It does not
tell us about the speed at which information can be exchanged, we can calculate the shortest path
but this not necessarily the fastest one as cables are not all of the same quality. Second, this measure
tells us whether or not two countries are connected, but it does not tell us how much information is
(and can be) exchanged between them. Nevertheless, we believe it is a valid proxy of the ability of
two countries to communicate in a fast and reliable manner through this new technology. It differs
considerably from the measure used in the first attempt to assess the effect of telegraph on trade (Lew
and Cater, 2006), namely the product of the number of telegraphs sent by each country. This variable
is not bilateral in essence, two countries may indeed send a lot of telegraph but are not connected
and therefore cannot communicate with each other. Moreover it does not allow the inclusion of
destination-year and origin-year fixed effects, that are now standard in gravity equations.

3      Main results

3.1     Estimation

      To determine the effect of news agencies and telegraph on bilateral trade, we estimate the panel
version of gravity equations. As recalled by Head and Mayer (2014b), a gravity equation for bilateral
trade flows can be obtained from all the main models of international trade, so that our results do
not require any assumption on the most appropriate way to model trade flows in the XIXth century.
The gravity equation of trade flows refers to a multiplicative structure of the type:


                                             Yod t = Oot Dd t φod t ηod t

where Yod t denotes the bilateral trade flow between the origin o and the destination d during year
t. Oot is a measure of the capability of country o to export, whatever the destination, and Dd t
captures the general propensity of country d to import, whatever the origin of these imports. φod t
is a bilateral resistance term incorporating the effect of all the trade frictions between the importer
and the exporter. Finally, ηod t is an error term with mean zero. Among the factors determining the
bilateral resistance term, φod t , some are fixed over time, others do vary over time :

                          φod t =             Bod               ×          exp(β 0 Xod t )
                                             |{z}                          |   {z       }
                                    Fixed bilateral frictions       Time-varying bilateral frictions


Plugging this into the gravity equation, and taking the expected value of trade flows:

                          E(Yod t ) = Oot Dd t φod t
                          E(Yod t ) = exp(ln(Oot Dd t φod t ))
                          E(Yod t ) = exp(ln(Oot ) + ln(Dd t ) + ln(Bod ) +β 0 Xod t )
                                          | {z } | {z } | {z }
                                                 FEot           FEd t         FEod


This leaves us with the following conditional expectation for the bilateral trade flow:

                              E(Yod t ) = exp(FEot + FEd t + FEod + β 0 Xod t )                        (2.1)

Equation (2.1) shows that if we include sets of importer × year, destination × year and country pair
fixed effects, and if the vector of time varying frictions Xod t is complete, then each component of the
vector β can be recovered without bias. The variables we are interested in are part of Xod t , since
they are bilateral and time varying, so that obtaining unbiased estimates of β is what we desire.
Estimating equation (2.1), any country specific variable, such as the quality of institutions, GDP,
or productivity is fully captured by the origin-time or destination-time fixed effects. Similarly, the
specific nature of a relationship between two trade partners, i.e. the fact that two countries may
trade more together because of cultural or historical factors, or for any other idiosyncratic reason, is
captured by the dyadic fixed effects as long as it is not time varying.
      As explained in the previous section, we constructed two dummy variables proxying for the
bilateral coverage by a global news agency (N ewsAg enc yod t ) and the connection by a telegraph
(Tel e g r aphod t ). Because the bilateral information flow should be higher when these two dummy


                                                            86


variables both take value 1, we are especially interested in their interaction term, N ewsAg enc yod t ×
Tel e g r aphod t . If news agencies and telegraphs are complementary, because the telegraph allows
for a more efficient communication among the network of global news agencies, while news agen-
cies provide content that can be shared with a wider audience than private telegrams, the effect of
N ewsAg enc yod t × Tel e g r aphod t is expected to be positive: the importer and the exporter get more
information on each other, which is expected to increase trade between them. N ewsAg enc yod t ×
Tel e g r aphod t is not captured by the fixed effects since its value changes over time within a dyad
and over trade partners within a country-year. The sign of the coefficients on N ewsAg enc yod t and
Tel e g r aphod t could be either positive or null. It would be positive if the sole fact of being covered
by a news agency (or benefiting from a telegraphic connection) increases the amount of information
transmitted, or null if only the conjunction of the two matters.
   News agency coverage and telegraphic links could be correlated with changes in the colonial ties
linking both countries14 , which are in turn linked to trade flows, so that failing to account for those
ties may result in an omitted variable bias. Therefore, in our baseline specification, the vector of time-
varying variables, Xod t , also includes three controls for colonial ties: BothC ol onizedod t indicates
whether both countries currently are colonies (not necessarily of the same empire), SameC ol onizerod t
takes value 1 if the importer and the exporter belong to the same colonial empire, i.e. are currently
colonized by the same country, and finally M et r opol eC ol on yod t captures the specific metropole-
colony ties (the importer is the colonizer of the exporter, or vice-versa).
   To summarize, the panel data gravity estimation allows us to get rid of potential confounding
factors at the dyadic level and at the country-year level. The estimates are identified from time
variations in trade flows, and therefore rely solely on dyads whose status changed over time. Con-
cerning news agencies, the overwhelming majority of these changes consists in entering the cartel
agreements. Very few countries are reassigned to another news agency, and no country is dropped
out of the cartel agreements. For telegraphic connection, the changes comes from telegraphic links
creations.
   To estimate equation (2.1), two methods can be used. The first one consists in log-linearizing.
Then, the trade friction coefficients β can be estimated through OLS:


                                   Ln(Yod t ) = FEot + FEd t + FEot + β 0 Xod t + "od t

   Nevertheless, this OLS estimator is biased under heteroskedasticity (Silva and Tenreyro, 2006).
To overcome this, one can use a pseudo maximum-likelihood estimator, assuming either a Poisson
distribution for the density function (Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood, henceforth PPML), or a
Multinomial distribution (Multinomial Pseudo Maximum Likelihood). Both assumptions yield iden-
tical estimates as long as destination fixed effects are included (Sotelo, 2017), which is the case in all
of our specifications. Besides the fact that it corrects for the heteroskedasticity driven bias affecting
the OLS estimator, the PPML estimator essentially differs from its OLS counterpart on two accounts:

1. The weight put on large trade flows : PPML gives more importance to large trade flows than
   OLS (Head and Mayer, 2014b). To ensure that countries are treated more equally, Sotelo (2017)
   proposes to use market shares, i.e. trade flow between the two countries divided by total imports
   of the destination country.
  14
       The colonial ties are not absorbed by the dyadic fixed effects since they vary over time during our period of interest.


                                                              87


2. The ability to handle zero trade flows : because it relies on a log-linearization, OLS requires to
   drop the zeros, while PPML does not, allowing for the incorporation of an extensive margin in the
   estimates (by extensive margin, we mean the switch from zero trade to strictly positive trade for
   a given dyad). Whether this is a desirable feature or not depends on the (unknown) true nature
   of the zero trade flows: are they true zero trade flows or unrecorded trade flows?

      Because of its ability to correct for the heteroskedasticity driven bias, PPML is our preferred
estimator. Nevertheless, we provide additional results based on OLS estimations, that are not qual-
itatively different from the ones we obtain from the PPML estimations. When estimating PPML
models, we use as dependent variable trade shares instead of trade levels, to ensure that the weight-
ing scheme is more comparable to the one from the the OLS estimations. These trade shares are
denoted Sod t in the rest of the paper, and are defined as the share of imports of country d coming
from country o:

                                                       Yod t
                                           Sod t = P
                                                       o6=d   Yod t

      In our dataset, some zero trade flows are recorded, which correspond to cases in which the
creators of TRADHIST considered that there was indeed a null trade flow between the two countries,
i.e. that the missing trade flows was not due to a lack of data. However, this is necessarily based
on assumptions on a threshold above which the data is deemed sufficiently complete to confidently
attribute the absence of a recorded flow to an absence of transaction. Moreover, we merge some
geographical entities to ensure the consistency of each country included in our dataset over the
whole period of study, and zero trade flows are not defined for these newly created country pairs.
Our approach is therefore to use the information on zero trade flows in our preferred specification,
but to provide as robustness checks estimates from specifications in which we either drop all the
zero trade flows, or assume that all the non strictly positive trade flows between any existing pair of
countries actually are zero trade flows, i.e. forcing the sample to be perfectly balanced.


3.2     Results

      Table 2.1 presents our main results. We estimate the panel gravity model from equation (2.1)
using alternatively an OLS estimator, in columns (1) and (2), and a PPML estimator, in the other
columns, (3) to (6). We also present results with or without controlling for colonial ties, and with
different approaches in dealing with non strictly positive trade flows.
      Column (4) is in our view the most appropriate specification: it corrects for the potential het-
eroskedasticity driven bias of the OLS estimates, while incorporating information from the most
reasonable zero trade flows (the ones included in TRADHIST) and giving an equal weight to all
countries thanks to the use of trade shares as dependent variable. With this specification, we find
that the telegraph on its own increased trade by 38%, news agencies by 33% (although this esti-
mate is not significant, a point we comment below) while the combination of the two resulted in a
magnified increase, 30% additional trade. The variable identifying the improvement in information
sharing between the two countries is the interaction term, and the fact that its effect is positive and
significant confirms that improving the access to public information fosters trade.
      In columns (1) and (3), we present results obtained when omitting the variables controlling for

          Note: Data is aggregated at the country pair × year level. The dependent variable is the log of the

          country o (Sod t ) in the remaining columns, (3) to (6). All estimations include destination × year,
          origin × year and country-pair fixed effects. N ewsAg. × Tel. is a dummy indicating that both
          countries are covered by a news agency and linked by a telegraph. “Balanced” sample refers to
          the case in which we form all the possible combinations dyads × year and assign a zero trade flow
          if nothing was recorded in TRADHIST. In brackets are the standard errors, clustered by country-
          pair. Significance levels: a : p < 0.01; b : p < 0.05; c : p < 0.1.


colonial ties. These controls include three dummy variables: one indicating that both countries are
colonized (potentially by a different country), the other one that they are colonized by the same
country (they belong to the same colonial empire) and the last one that a country is a colony and
the other one is its colonizer. When comparing these estimations to their counterpart with colonial
ties controls (columns (2) and (4) respectively), we see that the estimates are remarkably close,
suggesting that the correlation between our variables of interests and the colonial status is low.
   The results are qualitatively unchanged when we use an OLS estimator. The presence of both
a news agency and a telegraph in both countries still has a positive and significant effect on trade,
which is even a bit larger than the one found with a PPML estimation (a 53% increase), but is also
slightly less precisely estimated. For the telegraph, the effect as is remarkably close to the PPML
estimate (38% more trade).
   In columns (5) and (6), we experiment different assumptions on the appropriate way to treat
zero trade flows. Column (5) presents our estimates after dropping all the zero trade flows. While
the magnitude of the interaction term is left almost unchanged, the effect of the telegraph is reduced,
suggesting that communication technologies per se have an important effect on the extensive margin
of trade, i.e. on the probability that a dyad has a positive trade flow. In the last column (6), we con-
duct a different experiment, assuming that all the potential dyads for which we have no information
in TRADHIST actually have a zero trade flow. With this balanced sample, the point estimates of the

telegraph effect and of the interaction term grow, but the interaction term is less precisely estimated,
and its effect is therefore not significant anymore.
     The contribution of this paper is to establish the positive effect of a shock on information, identi-
fied by the joint presence of a news agency and a telegraphic link between the two countries. On top
of being positive and significant, this pure effect of information is relatively large (a 30% increase
in trade in our preferred specification). Interestingly, this magnitude is in line with the results of
Dickstein and Morales (2018), who find that, for contemporary trade on chemicals, switching from
minimal information to perfect foresight would result in aggregate exports rising by 25.1 to 33.5%.
With a value of −5 for the trade elasticity of trade flows with respect to trade costs,15 this 30%
increase in trade value corresponds to a 5 percentage points decrease in the iceberg trade cost.16
     The positive effect of telegraphs on trade is not a novel finding of this paper, but it confirms in
a larger sample and over a longer time-horizon the results of Steinwender (2018). Her estimates
imply an increase by 87%17 of cotton exports from New-York to Liverpool after the opening of the
transatlantic telegraph, an effect that incorporates both the reduction in communication costs and
the more efficient provision of information, and that should therefore be compared to the one we
find when summing the effects of the telegraph and of the interaction term.
     The effect of news agencies per se (i.e., in the absence of telegraph) on trade is always positive, but
never statistically significant. This suggests that in the absence of a telegraph connection, the news
agencies were not able to efficiently share information. “Important news travelled along telegraph
lines. And wherever there were such lines, there was also the latest news.” (Wenzlhuemer, 2013,
p.91). The corollary is that wherever there was no telegraph line, the news agencies were not able
to operate in a fully satisfactory manner.
     In appendix table 2.6, we introduce alternatively in the regression each of our variables of inter-
est, i.e. we estimate one specification with news agencies as the sole explanatory variable of interest,
one with telegraph only, and one with the interacted term only. The effects of both the telegraph and
the news agencies appear a bit larger when the interaction is not properly accounted for, highlighting
the necessity to consider simultaneously these two determinants of trade.


4        Robustness checks

     All our specifications include time-varying origin and destination fixed effects, which rule out
the hypothesis that our effect is driven by the general tendency of trade flows to rise over the period
we study. These fixed effects also ensure that our estimates are isolated from channels not directly
related to a decrease in bilateral trade frictions, such as an increase in GDP of the countries benefiting
    15
       This value of the trade elasticity parameter comes from Fouquin and Hugot (2016), who estimate the elasticity of
trade flows with respect to trade costs during the period we study and find it to be around −5, a value remarkably close
to the median of the estimates obtained on more recent data (Head and Mayer, 2014b)
    16
       The trade effects we estimate are the product of the semi-elasticity of trade costs with respect to our information
shock and the elasticity of trade flows with respect to trade costs:

                                          ∂ ln(Yod t )   ∂ ln(Yod t ) ∂ ln(τod t )
                                                       =              ×
                                            ∂ X od t     ∂ ln(τod t )   ∂ X od t
where τod t denotes the iceberg trade cost. Plugging in our estimates: 0.26 = −5x, hence x = −0.052. Hence the 5
percentage points decrease in iceberg trade costs.

from news agency and telegraph coverage, or more openness to trade in general. Indeed these two
factors depend solely on the origin or destination, and are therefore fully absorbed by the set of fixed
effects.
      We also include dyadic fixed effects which control for time-unvarying specific bilateral relation-
ships. These dyadic fixed effects control for observable factors like distance or language proximity,
but also for factors that would be harder to measure in a satisfactory manner, such as diplomatic
or cultural proximity between the two countries. Therefore, the positive effect we find cannot be
attributed to a cross-sectional positive correlation between our variable of interest and any omitted
variable that would positively affect trade. In order for our identification to be biased, an unac-
counted factor has to vary over time within a pair of countries and be correlated with news agency
coverage and telegraphic connections.
      We identify two such threats to our identification. The first one is that the date at which a
telegraph is built between a country pair or at which the country pair is included in the syndication
agreement may be driven either by anticipation of large trade flows or respond to observed past large
trade flows. The second one is that it may be driven by diplomatic factors that would correlate with
the bilateral trade policy, i.e. two countries may have a more favorable relationship that would be
associated both with telegraph & news agencies link and lower trade barriers.
      Our first robustness check is to isolate the sub-sample of the treated units for which the treatment
date could be endogenous, in order to focus on the treated units for which it is exogenous. This is
done in sub-section 4.1, where we present results estimated solely from indirect connections, and
find that the positive trade effects we identified still do exist when relying on the most exogenous
source of variation. To address more specifically the second threat, we check in sub-section 4.2
whether our variables of interest are correlated with tariffs on a subsample of our dataset (the dyads
for which we do have tariff rates, that are unfortunately not available for our complete universe). We
find no significant correlation, which suggests that trade policy is not closely tied with telegraphic
and news agency linkages. Finally, in sub-section 4.3, we present the results of an event-study. They
confirm the absence of pre-trend in trade for the dyads that will be connected in the future.


4.1     Separating direct and indirect connections

      The timing of construction of a telegraphic line may be linked to anticipated trade flows, or to
past trade flows between the two countries that would become connected. Even though the technical
difficulties of the construction process made the precise timing of a successful telegraph opening hard
to predict, especially for submarine cables, as argued by Steinwender (2018), our approach is relying
on long-run time variations, which means that this short-run randomness in opening date may not
be sufficient to ensure exogeneity of our explanatory variable. Our coefficient on the trade effect of
telegraph could be either upward or downward biased, depending on the source of endogeneity. If
telegraphic lines are built between countries for which it is expected that the trade relationship will
deepen in the future, then we would overestimate the trade benefits of the telegraph. Conversely, if
telegraphic lines are built between countries that already have a deep trade relationship and therefore
a demand that is already very high for telegraphic services, then there would be less room for future
trade growth and we would underestimate the trade effect of the telegraph.
      To alleviate these concerns, we focus on indirect connections. While countries may broadly con-

trol the date at which a direct telegraphic link is established between them, they have less power
in deciding when the last missing segment to create a telegraphic path between them will be built.
For instance, Brazil and China became indirectly linked in 1874, after the completion of a transat-
lantic telegraph between Portugal and Brazil (with relays in Madeiras and Cabo Verde). Arguably
trade between China and Brazil had little influence on the timing of this connection. Therefore,
we estimate separately the effect of direct and indirect connections, by adding a dummy variable
Di r ec t Tel e g r aphod t that indicates a direct telegraph link. The coefficient on Tel e g r aphod t then
captures exclusively the effect of indirect links, and should provide a more accurate estimate of the
causal effect.
   Endogeneity concerns on the date of inclusion in the news agencies’ syndication agreement are
addressed with a similar strategy. The decision to add a country is linked to the expected profits from
selling news in this country, which in tun may be linked to trade flows. Note however that the link
has to be truly bilateral: the fact that countries are added based on their total economic size is not
an issue for our identification since we include time varyin origin and destination fixed effects in our
estimations. Also, we underline again that additions to the news agencies’ syndication agreement
occurred by waves: groups of countries were added in five staggered extensions, so the precise date
of inclusion is unlikely to be at the hands of the concerned countries. If there was nevertheless a
link between the date at which a pair of countries is included in the syndication agreement and
bilateral trade flows, it could lead either to over- or underestimation of the causal effect. If two
countries are included because of the prospect of large trade flows (and high demand for bilateral
information), then we would overestimate the information effect. Conversely, if two countries are
included because they faced an idiosyncratic positive shock on their past trade flows, we would
underestimate the information effect.
   We make use of the fact that the news agencies were not national but global operators. It is
unlikely that a country would be able to exert pressure on a large foreign company to curb its choices
towards covering certain areas. Lobbying efforts are easier when the firm is domestic. For instance,
it would be harder for Spain than for France to influence the choices of Havas, the French news
agency. Our strategy is therefore to decompose the country pairs between those in which one of
the countries is the headquarter of the news agency, and the ones in which none of the countries
is. The date of treatment is more likely to be endogenous in the former group, in which the news
agency is a domestic firm for one of the countries than in the latter one, in which the news agency is
a foreign operator for both countries. For instance, Argentina and Australia started being included
in the news agency network in 1876, arguably an exogenous timing since the country pair became
linked without any particular intent as a by-product of the agreement’s extension. To isolate the
dyads in which we could fear endogeneity, we add a dummy H eadquar t er N ewsAg enc yod t , taking
value 1 when both countries are covered by the same news agency and one of the countries is the
headquarter of the news agency. Havas is considered to be based in France, Reuters in the UK, and
Wolff in Germany.
   Figure 2.5 presents the results of this estimation. We use our preferred specification: PPML
estimator, with trade shares as dependent variables, on the complete sample (including the zero
trade flows provided in TRADHIST). However, in this graph the reference situation is the absence of
both a news agency and a telegraph, i.e. the interacted terms do not correspond to additional effects

as in table 2.1, but rather to total effects on trade. Additional effects are harder to interpret and are
therefore presented later, in table 2.2.
   We find that, in the absence of a telegraph, the trade effect of news agencies is not very different
whether or not one of the countries is the headquarter of the news agency (a 17% vs a 16% increase in
trade flows). This confirms that the endogenous timing of news agency coverage is not a big concern.
Coefficients are a bit less similar when we compare direct and indirect telegraphic links: a 25%
increase in trade for direct telegraphic lines vs a 30% increase for indirect telegraphic connections.
This is consistent with the scenario in which direct telegraphic lines are built across countries that
already had high trade levels before the construction, and for which there is less room for trade
growth.
   Most importantly, the trade effect of being indirectly connected both by a telegraphic line and
a news agency largely exceeds the sum of the two effects taken separately (108% (e0.73 ) vs 51%
(e0.15+0.26 )), which confirms that, even when focusing on the dyads for which the connection date
is more exogenous, we do find a positive and significant contribution of our information shock.
However, the additional trade effect of being covered by a news agency is significantly lower for
the country pairs that were directly connected by a telegraph than for those that were indirectly
connected, suggesting that these country pairs already had abundant information on each other, and
therefore benefited less from the arrival of a news agency. For these country pairs whose coverage
date is more endogenous, there seems to be no magnified effect in presence of both a news agency

   In table 2.2, we present results for a variety of specifications. The setup is slightly different from
the one used in figure 2.5, since effects can now directly be interpreted as additional marginal effects,
while they were total marginal effects in the graph. For instance, the coefficient on the interaction
term “News Agency × Telegraph” denotes the additional effect of being both indirectly covered by
a news agency and indirectly connected by a telegraph. This formulation allows to test directly our
hypothesis of interest, i.e. whether the positive shock on information corresponding to this scenario
increases trade.
   In column (1), we remind the results of our preferred baseline specification, corresponding to
column (4) of table 2.1. Column (2) corresponds to exactly the same specification as the one plotted
in figure 2.5. The interaction term purged from direct connections remains positive and significant,
with a magnitude close to our baseline estimate (trade increases by an additional 37% in presence

of both a news agency and a telegraph). This also confirms what we were able to visualize from
the graph: no difference in trade effect when one of the countries is the headquarter of the news
agencies, a slightly lower (but not significantly lower) effect when the telegraph link is direct, and
a significantly lower additional trade effects of news agencies when the telegraphic link is direct,
suggesting that these country pairs started from high trade levels and therefore benefited less from
the increase in information available.
      Column (3) confirms that the colonial ties controls do not play a large role in our estimation, since
the estimates are barely affected by their omission. In column (4), we use an OLS estimator and find
that the results are essentially unchanged, except on two accounts: the additional effect of news
agencies appear larger, and direct telegraphic links now appear to have a positive and significant
effect on trade.18 In column (5), we switch back to PPML but restrict the sample to strictly positive
trade flows: the additional trade effect of news agencies and telegraphs is now very close to our
baseline estimate from column (2), suggesting that the high magnitude observed in column (4) had
more to do with the use of an OLS estimator than with the omission of the extensive margin.
      The results in table 2.2 are consistent with the picture obtained by running a series of cross-
sectional gravity estimations, one for each year of the sample. We define a dummy variable identify-
ing the countries that are covered by a news agency for the first time in the 1876 cartel agreement,
and check year after year whether, in cross-section, these countries trade more together. Similarly, we
estimate the cross-sectional trade effect for the headquarter dyads that entered the cartel agreement
in 1876. The evolution over time of these cross sectional estimates is plotted in figure 2.6.19
      On the right hand side graph, we see that the headquarter dyads tend to trade more together
than what would be predicted by a standard gravity equation, even before the news agency coverage
actually starts for them, i.e. before 1876. This suggests the existence of a privileged relationship that
is not improved by the additional information, and even seems to fade away in the long-run. The
pattern is very different for the “indirect” news agency connections (left hand side of the graph):
the coefficients are never significant before the start of the news agency coverage, suggesting that
there is no special relationship between these pairs of countries before 1876. After this date however,
their trade relationship starts improving and a decade later they trade significantly more than the
benchmark from the gravity equation.


4.2     Proxy trade policy with tariffs

      Another approach to circumvent the issue of potential endogeneity of coverage by telegraph
and news agencies is to have a look at the most easily quantifiable measure of trade policy: tariffs.
TRADHIST provides information on the average customs duties for 8000 dyads-year. This measure
is far from exhaustive, and has some well-known limitations.20 Nevertheless it is likely to remain a
    18
       This suggests that direct telegraph lines did not induce dyads with zero trade flows to trade, but rather intensified
trade between dyads that already used to trade (in other words, direct telegraphic lines mostly affected the intensive
margin). This hypothesis is comforted by the fact that, when we switch back to PPML but restrict the sample to strictly
positive trade flows the coefficient on direct telegraphic lines again appears positive and significant (see column (5)).
    19
       For the curious reader, similar plots are available for the other variables included in our regressions, namely the
colony control variables and the geographic distance (figure 2.17 in the appendix). Of particular interest is the fact that
the so-called “distance puzzle” (i.e. the idea that the distance coefficient remains remarkably stable despite deep changes
in the trade environment) is as vivid during the XIXth century as during the XXth century.
    20
       If tariffs are very high on a given product, imports should decrease, therefore the weighted average of tariff is likely
to be biased downwards.

good proxy for the bilateral openness between two countries.21
       Ideally, we would include tariffs in the baseline regression as a robustness check. This is however
not feasible given that we have tariffs only for a small subsamble of the dyads. The estimation would
therefore be performed on a very different sample than in the baseline specification. However, if
tariffs were correlated with our variables of interest in a way that may affect our estimates, then we
would expect a within-dyad link between tariffs and news agency / telegraph coverage on the sample
for which we have tariff data. To test this, we regress bilateral tariffs on our variables of interest and
a set of dyadic and year fixed effects (table 2.3). We find no significant correlation between tariffs
and our news agency / telegraph coverage dummies, which suggests that trade policy is not a major
threat to identification.


4.3           Event study

       The construction of the telegraph network and the extension of the global news agencies cartel
were progressive over time, so that the first year in which the country is “treated” (i.e when both a
telegraph link and a news agency coverage is available) differs across pairs of countries. There is
a wide dispersion in treatment dates (plotted in figure 2.11, in the appendix). The fact that not all
units in the panel receive treatment at the same time, and that some units are never treated allows
estimating a dynamic model (event-study) to describe the evolution over time of the outcome before
and after the treatment, yielding insights on the duration and the evolution of the treatment effect.
       This is done by constructing a set of dummy variables, each corresponding to a certain number of
years separating the dyad from its treatment date. Let Kod t denote the number of years to treatment
   21
      We are especially reassured by the way this tariff measure correlates with our main variables of interest in a series of
cross-sectional regressions (table 2.8, in the appendix). This confirms our priors, without threatening our identification
strategy, which relies on time-variations.

France and Brazil are covered by a news agency and a telegraph is 1876. Therefore, for this obser-

take value zero (1{Kod t = k} = 0 ∀k 6= −6). Our aim is to estimate the marginal effects of each of
these dummy variables, that we denote γk . If a dyad is never treated, as is the case for 77.84% of

                treatment date is the first year in which both countries of the dyad are covered by a news agency
                and connected by the telegraph. The complete specification is provided in eq. (2.2)


          Figure 2.7 shows how the treatment effect evolves before and after the treatment date. Before
the treatment (left hand-side of the graph, with “years to treatment < 0”), we see that there is
no particular trend, i.e. that pre-treatment trade never significantly differs from its treatment date
level. In other words, dyads that are going to be connected by a news agency and a telegraph do
not seem to be on an increasing or decreasing time trend before actually being connected. The
picture is very different after the treatment (right hand-side of the graph): the dyads immediately
start trading more, the increase is steady up to 30 years after the treatment, at which point the trade
effect stabilizes at a rather high level.
          The magnitude of the effect is comparable to the one found in our baseline estimations. The
fact that it is long lasting is consistent with the permanent nature of the treatment: once a dyad is
connected by a telegraph and a news agency, it never switches back to non coverage, so the additional
flow of information never stops. Moreover, the long-run persistence of the effects of a shock on trade
costs has been documented in other contexts (X2021). The slow increase suggests that, on top of
direct knowledge of the foreign market conditions, our information shock affected trade through
long-run channels, potentially an increase in Foreign Direct Investments, international migrations,
or even a convergence in cultural tastes.


5          Testing the information channel

          The previous section identifies a positive and significant impact of the telegraph and news agency
coverage on trade. We attribute this effect to an improved access to information. However, our


                                                              98


variables of interest are only proxies for the increase in the quantity and quality of information. To
rule out other channels through which they may have affected trade, we test for the presence of
effects that that are more specific to the information channel.
      In the first sub-section, we document an increase in the volatility of trade flows after coverage by
a news agency and a telegraph, consistent with a better ability of traders to adapt to varying market
conditions. In a second sub-section, we provide quantitative evidence of an increase in the coverage
of foreign countries in the press when they become connected by a telegraph and a news agency.
This shows that the delivered information is indeed more abundant between the countries after they
benefit from the positive shock we rely on.


5.1     Trade volatility

      In this sub-section, we test a prediction of the Steinwender (2018) model linking trade and infor-
mation: a reduction in information frictions increases trade variance. Indeed, exports and imports
react to changes in expected demand from other countries. In the extreme case without any informa-
tion, exporters ship every year the same amount, corresponding to the expected demand. With more
information, exporters can respond faster and better to demand fluctuations. With perfect informa-
tion the variance of exports should be equal to the variance of demand as the exporting country can
perfectly adapt to the local demand.
      We assess whether trade flows between two countries become more volatile after these two coun-
tries are covered by a news agency. To this end, we use several measures of volatility. The first one
(column (1) in table 2.4 is the usual sample standard deviation. We compute for each dyad the
standard deviation of trade flows before and after the dyad is covered by a news agency. We then
regress this sample standard deviation on a dyadic fixed effect and a dummy taking value 1 if both
countries are covered by a news agency:

                                1/2
                    V ar p (Yod )
                    Ö                 = FEod + β1 Tel od p + β2 N Aod p + β3 N Aod p × Tel od p + "od p

      The second measure is the absolute value of the deviation of the trade flow at time t to the
mean trade flow in each period (before and after news agency coverage): |Yod t − Ȳod p(t) |. The
advantage of this measure is that it allows having several observations within each dyad for the two
time periods (before and after being covered by a news agency). Its drawback is that it can be very
noisy, especially with historical datasets that may contain more errors than recent ones. We regress
this absolute deviation on destination-year, origin-year and dyadic fixed effects, and a dummy taking
value 1 if both countries are covered by a news agency:

         |Yod t − Ȳod p(t) | = FEod + FEot + FEd t + β1 Tel od t + β2 N Aod t + β3 N Aod t × Tel od t + "od t

      The level of our volatility measure does not have any meaningful interpretation, we are mostly
interested in its change over time. For all possible versions of the outcome variable, we observe a
significant and positive impact of the news agency coverage on the volatility of trade flows. This
result is consistent with the idea that more information is available thanks to the news agencies,
which allows trade partners to adapt to the demand shocks.

5.2     Text analysis

      In this section, we provide evidence of an increase in the coverage of foreign countries in French
newspapers when these countries benefit from a telegraph connection with France or are included
in the news agencies’ syndication agreement. This analysis relies on a corpus of articles from the 16
main French newspapers, processed during the Europeana Newspapers project.22
      For each newspaper and country, we count on a yearly basis the number of days in which the
country appears at least once in the newspaper’s articles. We define an occurrence as the presence
in the text of either the country name or the capital name. We then create five distinct groups of
countries, based on their date of accession to the news agencies’ syndication agreement (1859, 1867,
1876, 1889 or 1902), and estimate separately in each of these groups the effect of news agencies
and telegraph on the number of days of presence:

country’s telegraph and news agency status switches from “not included” to “included”, allowing

for heterogeneous effects depending on the wave of news agencies coverage extension to which the
country belongs. Note that by construction the coefficient on news agencies alone is not identifiable
since within a group all countries have the same accession date, so that the time fixed effects fully
capture the news agencies effect.
   An important limitation to this exercise is that the sample is entirely made of French newspapers,
which only allows us to estimate the effect by relying on on the different coverage dates with respect
to France, instead of the more diverse set of bilateral coverage dates used to obtain the estimates on
trade flows in the two previous sections. In other words, the sample is much more limited in terms of
geographical scope, which limits the sources of variations we can use to identify the potential effect.
   Our results are plotted in figure 2.8. We find that the extensions that triggered the largest effect
are the 1876 and 1889 agreements. This is probably due to the fact that these extensions included
countries on which France likely had fewer information. On the contrary, earlier agreements covered
either direct neighbors of France, or other European countries, for which it is likely that French
newspapers already had more information. Moreover, we have a lower number of newspapers in
our sample at the start of the period, leading to noisier estimates. This may explain why, even though
they are always positive, the estimates are very low for the two first extensions, and not significant.
Interestingly, the telegraph effect is always positive and significant in all but one group of countries.
This implies that the telegraph was also a key determinant of the amount of public information
available, but as argued in previous sections it also had a massive effect on private communication
costs and can therefore not be used to isolate the pure effect of information on trade.

6    Conclusion

    We use the joint expansion of the telegraph and the news agencies to disentangle the pure infor-
mation effect from the effect of reduced communication costs. The positive trade effect of linking
two countries through the telegraphic network is magnified when these two countries are also both
part of a news agency syndication agreement facilitating the exchange of information. We estimate
that the decrease in coordination costs allowed by the telegraph raised the value of trade by 40%,
while the increase in the flow of information associated with the coverage by one of the global news
agencies resulted in an additional 30% growth of trade.
    The positive and significant effect of the telegraph and news agencies interaction subsists when
focusing on indirect connections, which are less likely to suffer from the potential endogeneity bias
linked to expectations of the operators. Additionally, we document patterns consistent with an in-
crease in the flow of information: the variance of trade increases after the connection by a telegraph
and a news agency, suggesting an improvement in the ability to adapt to demand shocks, and the
presence of a foreign country in French newspapers increases after this country is linked to France
by a telegraph and a news agency.
    While estimated from a historical event, the results are relevant to understand contemporary
trade flows, since exporters still may lack the necessary information, despite considerable improve-
ment in communication technologies.

   This paper does not take a stance on the precise mechanism through which better access to
information on foreign countries affects trade. On top of the improved knowledge of foreign market
conditions, news agencies and telegraphs may have affected other outcomes such as Foreign Direct
Investment, human migration flows or even cultural tastes. We leave for future research to delve
into these potential channels.

Trade and Transport Costs: Evidence
from Hurricane Sandy

This chapter is co-authored with Emanuele Mazzini (OECD)



                                                        Abstract

The fact that international trade flows are approximately inversely proportional to distance and that
this distance elasticity cannot be entirely explained by transport costs is well-established. This paper
investigates the situation of intra-national trade costs, and reaches a similar conclusion: we find that
the total distance elasticity of trade flows within the USA is around -0.84, while if transport costs were
the only source of spatial frictions, this distance elasticity would be approximately 14 times lower
(around -0.06). We establish this result by using hurricane Sandy as a natural experiment shifting
upwards transport costs in some areas of the US. Pairs of origin and destination are heterogeneous
in their exposure to the hurricane since the share of the usual route between them going through
the affected areas varies. This provides us with a set of bilateral changes in transport costs, whose
effect on trade can be estimated.



1    Introduction

    The fact that distance impedes trade flows is one of the most robust findings in the empirical
trade literature. The most recent meta-analysis (Head and Mayer, 2013), including 1835 estimates
of the distance elasticity of trade flows, reveals that this elasticity hovers around -1. While transport
costs appear as a natural explanation to rationalize this distance effect, their elasticity with respect to
distance would have to be well above the current estimates to be consistent with a distance elasticity
of trade flows of -1. Moreover, the distance elasticity did not decrease during the last decades, while
transport costs experienced a dramatic fall over the same period. This points to the existence of
some other types of spatial frictions, which Head and Mayer (2013) named “dark trade costs”, in an
analogy with the “dark matter” in cosmology.1
     1
       Dark matter in astrophysics is an hypothetical type of matter, non observed but whose existence is inferred from its
gravitational effects. The same applies to “dark trade costs”: although they are hardly observable, they may be responsible
for up to 85% of the distance effect on trade (Head and Mayer, 2013).

    Potential sources for these frictions are diverse. They include, for example, differences in culture
and tastes, a lack of mutual trust, and the spatial decay of information. Intuitively, we expect these
mechanisms to affect less trade within countries than trade between countries. Indeed, culture
and tastes are arguably more similar within a country than between countries, the spatial decay
of information should be lower, and mutual trust should be higher. Additionally, tariffs and the
“grey trade costs” of crossing borders (non-tariff barriers to trade) are absent. Therefore, we may
wonder whether “dark trade costs” do exist within countries, or whether the only substantial source
of spatial frictions is the transport cost. Our work sheds light on this question, focusing on the case
of the USA. We provide an upper bound for the part of the distance elasticity of trade flows that is
due to transport costs. We find that while the total distance elasticity of internal trade flows is -0.84,
this distance elasticity would be significantly smaller, around -0.06, if there were no other trade costs
than transport costs. This allows us to unambiguously reject the hypothesis that there are no “dark
trade costs” within the US.
    We obtain this result by making use of the massive disruptions on the transport infrastructure
caused by hurricane Sandy in October 2012. These disruptions led to a sizable increase in transport
costs in the affected area (the North-East of the US). Dyads for which a large share of the usual
optimal route goes through the affected region are more affected than dyads for which the usual
optimal path avoids the damaged area. This supplies us with a set of bilateral variations in transport
costs. Our specification controls for the numerous potential side-effects of the hurricane that may
have affected trade, such as the decrease in production or the operational issues faced by the firms.
    Although the question of the nature of the “dark trade costs” is out of the scope of this paper,
we see a promising explanation in the recent contribution of Chaney (2018b), who shows that the
constant distance elasticity of trade can be rationalized by a model in which firms trade only through
a network of contacts, and this network is spatially clustered. With this explanation, the distance
elasticity of trade flows is not primarily linked to transport costs, and its magnitude depends on the
structural parameters underlying the network formation dynamics. The scarcity of business links over
large distances may be an important component of the “dark trade costs”. This scarcity is confirmed
by Bernard et al. (2019) who, studying buyer-supplier relationships among Japanese firms, find that
distance strongly reduces the probability of forming a business link.
    The second aspect of our contribution is methodological : we show how an indirect inference
estimator can be applied to structural gravity models in order to estimate the local effect of Sandy
on transport costs in the affected region. The intuition of this estimation method is that we find the
value of the increase in transport costs for which the change in trade patterns we observe in real data
matches the one we obtain in data simulated from a structural gravity model. More precisely, we use
the fact that the bilateral changes in trade costs due to Sandy result in variations of the origin and
destination specific multilateral resistance terms. We find the value of the local change in transport
costs for which the variations of the multilateral resistance terms in simulated data are the closest to
their empirical counterparts.
    To the best of our knowledge, Feyrer (2011) was the first paper to use a natural experiment in
order to isolate the role of transport costs in explaining the distance elasticity of trade from the role of
other trade costs. He computed the change in bilateral sea distances that resulted from the closing of
the Suez Canal in 1967 and its reopening in 1975 and found a distance elasticity comprised between

-0.5 and -0.2, much lower than the total distance elasticity (-1), which he interpreted as evidence
that transport costs were not sufficient to explain the whole distance elasticity of international trade
flows. His work was deepened by Hugot and Umana Dajud (2016), who added the Panama canal to
the analysis and improved the estimation method. They found a distance elasticity of -0.15, again
significantly below -1. These two papers however are not able to conclude on the existence of “dark
trade costs” within countries, since they only consider maritime international trade flows. The idea
that natural disasters may locally and temporarily increase transport costs in some areas of a given
country was confirmed by Volpe Martincus and Blyde (2013), who showed that the 2010 earthquake
in Chile had a negative effect on the exports of firms for which the optimal route was passing through
affected regions. However, they did not attempt to relate their estimates to the distance elasticity of
trade, unlike our work.
      While some papers highlighted the existence of spatial frictions within countries, on top of trans-
port costs, their approach yields more restrictive results than ours. For instance, Hortaçsu et al.
(2009) studied eBay transaction within the 48 continental states of the US and found that distance
had a negative effect on trade, even after controlling for shipping costs. Nevertheless their data cov-
ers only a small subsample of internal US trade flows, that may not be representative. Wrona (2018)
identifies a border effect between East- and West-Japan, which is less general than our finding, in the
sense that we show that internal trade flows are systematically more distance sensitive than what
would be expected when taking only transport costs into account, not only when they cross a border.
      The paper proceeds as follows. We start with a quick description of hurricane Sandy and its
effects on transport infrastructure and trade flows (section 2). We provide some evidence of the dis-
ruptive effects of the hurricane, using data we obtained from states’ Department of Transportation,
and we explain how we computed the bilateral changes in transport costs induced by Sandy. Section
3 presents the theoretical framework we use, especially the way we model trade costs and their de-
composition. It also details our identification strategy, which exploits the time variations in bilateral
transport costs to estimate a gravity equation with dyadic fixed effects capturing the time invariant
trade costs, and time varying origin and destination fixed effects capturing the direct economic im-
pact and the other disruptions caused by the hurricane. Section 4 is dedicated to the presentation
of our indirect inference estimator. Finally, we present our main result, establishing the existence of
“dark trade costs” within the US, along with some robustness checks in section 5.


2      Hurricane Sandy

2.1     An exceptionnal and destructive storm

      Sandy is a hurricane2 that hit the Northeastern US at the end of October 2012. It can be con-
sidered as an exceptionally massive storm for the US, both because of its impact and characteristics.
Sandy made landfall on October 29th, 2012 near Brigantine in New Jersey. At this date, it was not
at the peak of its intensity (this peak was reached over Cuba), but it was still very intense and wide,
with tropical storm-force winds extending 805 km from the center of circulation just prior to land-
    2
      Note that when it reached the US territory, the storm was technically speaking no longer a hurricane, but rather
a “post-tropical” cyclone, because it lacked the typical strong thunderstorm activity near its center and had lost its eye.
Nevertheless, throughout this paper we will use the term hurricane to refer to it since this is the common practice.

fall.3 The storm’s angle of approach (a perpendicular one) and the fact that the landfall coincided
with high tide and full moon also explain the exceptional effects of Sandy, since these two element
led to record storm tide heights (the storm surge combined with astronomical tide) and the surge’s
large waves were driven directly into the coastal cities.
    After landfall, Sandy slowed down and weakened, but its broad size nevertheless led to disrup-
tions across the Eastern and Midwestern US, as well as Southeastern Canada. High winds, heavy
rains and accumulating snows were recorded because of Sandy’s remnants moving through south-
ern Pennsylvania. In the central Appalachian Mountains, blizzard conditions occurred and strong
winds spread into the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes on October 31st. The hurricane completely
dissipated in Eastern Canada in the next two days. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration (NOAA) estimated that the entire area affected by the winds during the track extended over
more than 5 million square kilometres and that more than 60 million people were directly affected
across 24 states (Mildenhall et al. (2013), p. 13).
    The exceptional intensity and width of this storm explains the high death toll: according to
Blake et al. (2013), 72 people died in the Northeastern US as a direct consequence of the hurricane.
Economic losses were also large: AON Benfield, a leading insurance intermediary, evaluates the total
gross direct economic cost of hurricane Sandy as high as 68 billions USD (Mildenhall et al. (2013), p.
38), thus making it the second-costliest hurricane ever recorded in the USA (Katrina in 2005 being
the first one) (Mildenhall et al. (2013), p.45).


Massive disruptions for road transport              Hurricane Sandy caused a sizable temporary increase
in transport costs for all the goods that had to transit in the Northeastern US because it severely
damaged transport infrastructures in this area. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it was very difficult
to circulate after the passage of the hurricane, as the words of James Hadden (project manager for
the 511 Traffic and Travel Information Program at the New Jersey Department of Transportation)
perfectly summarize: “Roadway damage was beyond what anyone could have imagined”.4 Main roads
and highways were closed or re-routed due to flooding, downed trees, downed wires or debris while
trains and long-distance bus companies were forced to suspend operations across the Northeast for
several days.5
    This claim is supported by data we obtained from the New Jersey (NJ) and the New York (NY)
Department of Transportation (henceforth DOT), which contains information about all the disrup-
tions on the highway network recorded by the NJ DOT and the NY DOT during hurricane Sandy and
its immediate aftermath.6 The magnitude of the damages is confirmed by the figures given in table
3.1, where we classified the disruptions by categories and selected the categories that were unequiv-
ocally due to hurricane Sandy. Sandy caused overall more than 1000 disruptions on the highway
network in the two considered states. Downed trees, signals, wires or poles represented the most
important cause of disruptions (607 occurrences), followed by flooding (136 occurrences) and other
generic weather related events (96 occurrences). Other major sources of disruptions include debris,

      Tropical storm-force winds correspond to a wind speed above 89 km/h, a speed at which, according to Wikipedia,
“Trees are broken off or uprooted, structural damage likely”. Hurricane-force winds (above 118 km/h) extended 280
kilometers. Source: http://www.livescience.com/24380-hurricane-sandy-status-data.html

       Figure 3.1a shows that the number of hurricane related disruptions reached a remarkable peak
on October 30th, with around 400 disruptive events recorded by the NJ and the NY DOT that day.7
This suggests that the storm caused an unusual increase in the number of obstacles faced by potential
road users. Figure 3.9, in appendix plots the number of non hurricane related disruptions, for NJ
and NY separately. Consistently with our story, such disruptions did not experience any increase
following the hurricane. Figure 3.1b indicates the location of the recorded disruptions. It shows that
the disruptions affected the road network in a wide area, quite far inland, and were not limited to
the coast.

not restored: 21% of gas stations had no gasoline supply. Finally, the EIA warns that the reported
figures are “[. . . ] not designed to reflect the specific experience of more severely affected areas”,
which suggests that the shortage could have been locally more severe.10


2.2     Effects on trade flows

The Commodity Flow Survey Data on trade flows comes from the Public Use Microdata (PUM)
file of the 2012 Commodity Flow Survey (hereafter CFS). This survey is realized every five years
by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (hereafter BTS) and the Census Bureau. The 2012 CFS
covers approximately 60 000 establishments in mining, manufacturing, wholesale, auxiliaries, and
selected retail and services trade industries (a list of all the included industries can be found in the
appendix, table 3.12). Once an establishment is selected, it receives a questionnaire every quarter.
Reply is mandatory and the answers have to be exact, which ensures good quality of the data. In
total, the CFS records 4,547,661 shipments in 2012.11 The shipments included in the CFS do not
necessarily correspond to trade transactions. However, it is common practice to use the CFS to proxy
trade flows, as for instance in Duranton et al. (2014). For each shipment, we have information about
twenty variables such as the origin and the destination areas, the transport mode, the NAICS code
of the product as well as the value and the weight of the shipment.
      The CFS distinguishes five single modes and five multiple modes of transport. Table 3.13 provides
an exhaustive list of the modes of transport considered in the CFS and describe their respective
importance in terms of trade flows. It shows that shipments carried by truck represent by far the
large majority of commodity flows. This is the reason why our analysis of the effect of Sandy focuses
on road trade flows.12 As a robustness check, we nevertheless check that there was no substitution
towards other modes of transport because of the hurricane.


Geographic information : the “CFS areas” For each shipment, we know the “CFS area” where
it originated and arrived. There are 129 distinct CFS areas. Out of these, 83 correspond either to a
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or a Combined Statistical Area (CSA), while the remaining 46
are “remainders”, namely portions of states that are not within a MSA/CSA. We do not include in our
sample the two CFS areas that are not within the continental USA, Hawaï and Alaska, because we
focus on inland trade. After this selection, our sample gathers 3,143,535 observations in 45 distinct
areas were either shut down or run at reduced capacity, pipelines had to be closed for safety precautions, imports from
the New York harbour were limited, and the disruptions on highways hampered the ability of trucks to deliver fuel when
they were able to obtain it. The US Department of Energy additionally reported that about 8.5 million customers were
without power during or after hurricane Sandy. Among them, many had to use electric generators requiring fuel, which
led to a demand spike, while some were gas stations, unable to serve customers because of power outages. Cf http:

       The term “shipment” is defined by the Census Bureau and the BTS as “a single movement of goods, commodities, or
products from an establishment to a single customer or to another establishment owned or operated by the same company
as the originating establishment (e.g., a warehouse, distribution center, or retail or wholesale outlet). Source: 2012 CFS

    Figure 3.2 represents the total export value and the total import value of each CFS area, normal-
ized by its surface. Unsurprisingly, we observe that urban CFS area trade more than rural CFS areas,
which is consistent with economic activity being spatially concentrated in these areas. Given that
the region affected by Sandy is highly urbanized, it accounts for a large share of US trade, which
means that even a small increase in transport costs in this region may have a sizable effect on trade.


The affected areas: Individual Assistance and Public Assistance programs. In order to identify
the areas that were affected by the Hurricane, we used geographic data from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (hereafter FEMA). We selected all the counties that benefited from Public As-
sistance (PA), or Individual Assistance (IA). Public Assistance is a program through which the FEMA
provides a grant to “fund the repair, restoration, reconstruction or replacement of a public facility or
infrastructure damaged or destroyed by a disaster”, while IA provides a federal funding “to individ-
uals and families who have sustained losses due to disasters”13 . The counties that benefited from IA
or PA are represented in blue in figure 3.3a. Note that sixteen CFS areas are at least partly in the
devastated zone, and the zone is large enough for increases in transport costs to occur even for pairs
of CFS areas that were not directly hit by the Hurricane, but for which the optimal itinerary goes
through the affected area.
    The idea that Sandy has hit a region that accounts for a large share of internal US trade is
confirmed when we plot the share of trade flows for which the origin or the destination is in the
region affected by the hurricane (figure 3.3b). This means that a large part of trade flows have been
affected by Sandy, and that all industries were concerned, which suggests that the effects on trade
will be large enough for us to measure them.


Total effect of Sandy on trade flows         Secondly, we compare the evolution over time of trade flows
in affected and unaffected areas. We aggregate all trade flows originating from or arriving to affected

areas and detrend this aggregate by regressing its values for the three first quarters on the time vari-
able (quarter) and taking the difference between the predicted value and the observed value. We use
a similar approach for all flows originating from or arriving to the unaffected areas. These detrended
aggregate flows are plotted in figure 3.4. They fall in both groups during the 4th quarter, but the
fall is more dramatic for flows for which the origin or the destination corresponds to an affected
area. The fact that trade flows between non affected CFS areas also decrease could be explained
by a global downward trend for the 4th quarter, but maybe also by the fact that the transport costs
might have increased for them too, if the optimal path between them and their trade partners goes
through the IA/PA counties. We insist on the fact that the effects highlighted by figure 3.4 embed not
only the effects of transport costs, but also all the direct economic damages caused by the hurricane.
Our identification strategy, that we will present in the next section, allows us to isolate the effect of
transport costs.

2.3     Determination of transport costs

The highway network                                      Geographical data on the US road network come from Natural Earth14 . The
map includes only major roads, which is an advantage for our analysis because it corresponds ap-
proximately to the US National Truck Network, a network of approved state and interstate highways
for commercial truck drivers15 . We turn this map of the road network into a raster where each cell
can take one of two values: either infinite value, if there is no road in the cell, or value 1 if there is a
road in the cell. This value corresponds to the transport cost to go through the cell. Because we are
only interested in the relative variation of transport costs, we could choose any value for the cost of
going through one cell, and this would not affect our results. Hence we normalize this cost by setting
its value to 1. A part of the road raster we use is visible in figure 3.6a (zoom on the North-East of
the USA).

determined the weighted centroid of each area, with weights based on population. More precisely,
we first determine the centroid of each county within a given CFS area and assign a weight to each
of these centroids, equal to the population of their county. The coordinates of the weighted centroid
of the CFS area are then given by the weighted average of the coordinates of the centroids of each
county within the considered CFS area. We use population weights because they can be considered
as a proxy for economic activity, and it is more likely that a shipment leaves from (or arrives to) a
place where economic activity is more intense. As a final step, we determine the point on a road
which is the closest to the calculated weighted centroid and use this point in our transport costs

Bilateral transport costs without Sandy Throughout this paper, we will distinguish two “states
of the world”. The first one corresponds to the situation during hurricane Sandy and its immediate
aftermath, where the road network is heavily affected. We will refer to it as the “Sandy state of the
world” and use the superscript S to denote it. The second state of the world, which we will refer to as
the “normal state of the world”, corresponds to the rest of the year: no unusual disruption affects the
road network. We will use the superscript N to denote this state of the world. Each state of the world
corresponds to a different vector of bilateral transport costs: the transport costs in the “normal state
of the world” are denoted TniN and the transport costs in the “Sandy state of the world” are denoted
 S
Tni .
        TniN is computed via a GIS software which has a built-in least cost path algorithm allowing to
find the shortest path between all pairs of CFS areas and to return the associated cost, which is our
measure of transport costs. The computation of transport costs during Sandy requires the creation
of a new road raster, which differs from the previous one by the fact that we consider that transport
costs have been multiplied by a certain factor, denoted κ in the area affected by the hurricane.
Concretely, it means that road cells in the IA/PA counties now have a value of κ instead of 1 (see
figure 3.6b). κ corresponds to the factor by which transport costs are multiplied in the affected
area during the hurricane. We call this factor the “overcost parameter”. For instance, if the overcost
parameter κ = 6, it means that it is six times more costly to go through cells in the affected areas
during the hurricane than in normal times. We explain in section 4 how we determined the value
of the overcost parameter. With the new road raster, the procedure to determine the transport costs
during Sandy is identical to the one described previously. For trade flows occurring within CFS areas,
we cannot use our algorithm because the origin and the destination point would be the same, so we
simply consider that transport costs have been multiplied by κ if the weighted centroid of the CFS
area lies within an IA/PA county.

the world. From these two vectors, we need to compute quarterly transport costs because our trade
data is quarterly. During the three first quarters, we consider that there are no major disruptions,
i.e. the state of the world is always normal, so that for t = {1, 2, 3}, Tni t = TniN . In the 4th quarter,
the state of the world can be Sandy or normal, so the transport costs are a weighted average of the
transport costs in the “normal state of the world”, TniN , and the transport costs in the “Sandy state of
             S
the world”, Tni . More precisely, the weights depend on the duration of each state of the world.17 Let
χ denote the fraction of the fourth quarter spent in the “Sandy state of the world”, i.e. the number
of days in the “Sandy state of the world” divided by the total number of days in the fourth quarter
(92 days). Then:
                                                         S
                                            Tni,t=4 = χ Tni + (1 − χ) TniN

    In our baseline estimation, we consider that the “Sandy state of the world” lasts for ten days,
hence χ = 10/92. The choice of this duration is justified by anecdotal evidence and by the fact that
a few days after Hurricane Sandy, a snow storm affected approximately the same area (the so-called
“November 2012 nor’easter”). Nevertheless, we show that our results still hold for a wide range of
values of χ, from χ = 1/92 to χ = 20/92.


3    Model

    We assume that bilateral trade flows are given by a structural gravity equation. Structural gravity
can be derived from most trade models and is therefore a fairly general specification. We do not need
to specify a full trade model to carry our analysis, we just need the resulting trade flows to follow
structural gravity. The trade flow for sector s from location i to location n at time t (denoted X nist )
takes the following form:

the value of expenditures in location n on goods from sector s. Our empirical counterparts are the
total value of goods leaving from i (including those dispatched in the same CFS area) and the total
value of goods arriving in n (including those from the same CFS area) respectively. Ωist and Φnst are
multilateral resistance terms (henceforth MRT) defined as:

    The “bilateral resistance term” (henceforth BRT), φnist , is a power function of trade costs : φnist =
τnist ε , where τnist is an iceberg trade cost and ε is the elasticity of trade flows with respect to trade
costs. Our interest lies in the effect of distance on trade costs, and its decomposition between a part
   17
      We simplify the problem by considering that the probability for a firm to be willing to send a shipment does not
depend on the day, so that the probability that the firm is willing to send the shipment during the “Sandy state of the
world” is given by the ratio of the disaster’s duration over the quarter’s duration (92 days)

related to transport costs and a part related to dark trade costs. For this purpose, we rewrite the
trade cost τnist as the product of two components: transport costs, Tnist , and dark trade costs, Cnist .

    Transport costs and dark trade costs are both positively related to distance, which makes it dif-
ficult to disentangle their respective contribution when regressing trade flows on distance. The
idea that transport costs increase with distance is quite intuitive, and corresponds to the findings
of Combes and Lafourcade (2005), who provide a comprehensive inventory of transport costs18 . We
model the effect of distance on transport costs in a simple and fairly general way, assuming that
transport costs are a power function of road distance, with exponent α (the elasticity of transport
costs with respect to distance):
                                                      Tni t = dni t α                                                (3.4)

    The current road distance may differ from the geographic distance. The current road distance
corresponds to the geographic distance multiplied by a factor δni t ≥ 1, reflecting the fact that roads
may not be straight lines and that some unusual detours may be imposed by the circumstances :
dni t ≡ g ni δni t , where g ni is the geographic distance and δni t is the ratio between road distance and
geographic distance. We normalize by setting δni t = 1 for the three first quarters of 2012. As a
consequence, we have Tni t = g ni α for t = {1, 2, 3}, and Tni t = dni t α for t = 4.
    Most of the potential candidates for explaining dark trade costs are strongly correlated with dis-
tance. For instance, tastes should be more similar between closer regions, information should flow
more easily over lower distances, and trust should be higher between neighbors. On top of this,
Chaney (2018b) shows that the ability of firms to create the business links necessary to trade de-
creases with distance. We therefore model dark trade costs as a power function of distance, and
incorporate this constant distance elasticity into a more general “dark trade costs” function, by al-
lowing for a destination-industry specific component, cnst , an origin-industry specific component,
cist , and a dyad-industry specific component, cnis :


                                               Cnist = g ni γ cnst cist cnis

    The dyad-industry component, cnis , is time independent because the “truly bilateral” dark trade
costs (e.g. proximity in culture and tastes , mutual trust, spatial decay of information) can reasonably
be considered as constant over our period of analysis (the year 2012). The origin and destination
specific components, cnst and cist , are time dependent because they correspond to trade costs that
Sandy may have increased, like the general level of mistrust or pessimism in the area, or operational
issues. Nevertheless, these components are specific to the origin or the destination of the trade flow,
so that they will be fully captured by the set of origin and destination fixed effects that we include.
   18
      Among the different costs they consider, some are proportional to distance (fuel consumption, vehicle maintenance
operating costs and tolls, others are proportional to the duration of the trip (driver’s wage and accommodation), and
because the duration of the trip increases with distance, such time-related costs are an increasing function of distance. We
could even consider a broader range of time-related trade costs since, as emphasized in Hummels and Schaur (2013), time
creates a delay between the moment when the production decision is made and the one when the product is sold, and
market conditions might change during this interval. In the case of intermediary goods, such delay might even jeopardize
the whole supply chain.

   This equation is key to our research question. It shows that the total distance elasticity of trade
flows, ερ, can be decomposed in two additive components: the transport cost effect, εα and the
dark trade cost effect, εγ. Our purpose is to obtain an upper bound for εα. If this upper bound is
lower than ερ, we can conclude that εγ is strictly positive, which implies the existence of dark trade
costs. Hurricane Sandy creates a variation in δni t , which we can use to estimate εα. This appears

   This shows that εα can be estimated using the standard panel data structural gravity specification:
regress the log of trade flows on the log of the change in distance induced by Sandy, with a time
varying destination-industry fixed effect, Dnst , a time varying origin-industry fixed effect, Oist , and a
dyad-industry fixed effect, Bnis . The inclusion of dyad-industry fixed effects is crucial, because these
fixed effects will capture all the time invariant trade costs that inflate the coefficient on distance in
usual gravity estimations.
   Looking more closely at the role of the origin fixed effects, , we see from eq. (3.6) that they
include three components: the total production of the origin, Yist , the outward MRT of the origin,
Ωist , and the origin-specific component of dark trade costs, cist . This means that the direct economic
effect of Sandy on the origin region (loss of production capacity) is fully controlled for by the origin
fixed effect: we expect Sandy to decrease Yist if i is in the North-East of the USA, but this will
be absorbed by Oist . Similarly, Sandy may have increased other types of trade frictions than the
sole transport costs. For instance, the standard operating procedures were probably disrupted, or
information did not flow as easily as in a normal period, or people lost confidence because of the
damage they suffered. All these frictions to trade are not destination specific, in the sense that they
affect trade towards all regions with the same magnitude. Hence, they correspond to an increase
in the origin-specific component of dark trade costs, cist , which is again fully controlled for by the
origin fixed effects, Oist , so that these trade frictions do not affect our estimates of εα. Finally the
potential effects of Sandy on the outward MRT, Ωist , are also absorbed by the origin fixed effects.
   Estimating the total distance elasticity of trade flows is fairly easy. Indeed, in the three first
quarters of 2012, there are no unusual disruptions on the road network (no hurricane Sandy), so
that we consider that δni t = 1. Plugging again our decomposition of trade costs into the structural
gravity equation, eq. (3.5), with δni t = 1, we obtain:

               ln(X nist ) = ln(Yist ) − ln(Ωist ) + ε ln(cist ) + ln(X nst ) − ln(Φnst ) + ε ln(cnst )

This shows that the total distance elasticity of trade flows, ερ, can be estimated from the standard
cross-section structural gravity specification, with origin-NAICS fixed effects, Oist and destination-
NAICS fixed effects, Dnst . We can either run one separate regression for each quarter, or pool data
from the three first quarters.

From transport costs to distance:                  Our least path algorithm gives us a good approximation of the
change in transport costs, Tni t , that we need to turn into a change in distance, dni t . We rely on the
                                                                                               1
functional form of the transport costs : Tni t = dni t α , implies that dni t = Tni t α . As a consequence,
if we are able to find an upper bound for the value of the elasticity of transport costs with respect
to distance, α, then we will also have a lower bound for the change in distance caused by Sandy.
This lower bound is sufficient to answer our research question, since underestimating the change in
distance will lead to an overestimation of the part of distance elasticity linked to transport costs, εα,
so that if we nevertheless find εα < ερ it reinforces our claim.
     A lower bound for α can be infered from the total distance elasticity of trade flows, ερ. Indeed,
ρ = α + γ and γ ≥ 0 so that α ≤ ρ. We set the value of the elasticity of trade flows with respect to
trade costs, ε, to −5, which corresponds to the mean value found in the literature when structural
gravity is used, according to the meta-analysis performed by Head and Mayer (2014b). Our estimate
of the total distance elasticity of trade flows, ερ, is -0.8419 . With ε = −5, this implies ρ = 0, 17. As
                                            1
a consequence α ≤ 0.17 so that              α   ≥ 5.88. Therefore, we compute dni t = Tni t 5.88 , and this gives us a
lower bound for the distance equivalent of the change in transport costs. Finally, since dni t = g ni δni t
and the geographic distance g ni is time independent, the time variation in δni t , which we will use as
a regressor to estimate the part of the distance elasticity linked to transport costs, εα (cf eq. (3.7))
is equal to the time variation in dni t , for which we obtained a lower bound from Tni t 5.88 .


4        Estimation of the overcost parameter (κ)

     In order to compute the change in transport costs during Sandy between each CFS area, we used
an “overcost parameter", denoted κ, defined as the factor by which transport costs are multiplied
in the affected areas during the hurricane. The value of this parameter affects our final results: the
higher we set κ, the higher will be the computed variation in transport costs, and therefore the higher
the variation in our explanatory variable (for the same variation in the explained variable. Therefore
setting a higher value for the “overcost parameter" results in a lower estimate of the part of distance
elasticity linked to transport costs, εα.
     We overcome this issue by estimating a lower bound for the value of the “overcost parameter",
using a method inspired from indirect inference (Gourieroux et al., 1993). The intuition behind
our method is the following: we simulate trade flows with different values of κ and determine each
time the implied changes in multilateral resistance terms (MRT), relying on the structural gravity
equations. We can then compare the changes in MRT obtained from the simulated data to the ones
estimated with real data, and find the value of κ that minimizes the distance between these two
vectors. Our results suggest that a lower bound for κ is 6.
     For feasibility reasons, we are not able to compute a different “overcost parameter” for each
industry. Therefore the subscript s is not necessary in this section: we consider trade flows aggregated
at the dyad level, instead of the dyad-NAICS level.


Effects of Sandy on trade costs The simulation of trade flows for any value of the “overcost pa-

              S
normal, and       for Sandy. Because we want to be able to easily generate trade flows for any value
of κ, and trade flows depend ultimately on the bilateral trade costs, we need a simple formula ex-
pressing the bilateral trade costs during Sandy, τSni , as a function of the bilateral trade costs in the
normal state of the world, τNni , and the “overcost parameter”, κ. The derivation of such a function
is straightforward under some simplifying assumptions that ensure that we will indeed estimate a
lower bound of the “overcost parameter”. We leave the details of this derivation in the appendix,
and present only the resulting equation:


                                         τSni = (sni (κ − 1) + 1)τNni                                (3.9)


Simulate trade flows in the normal state of the world and during Sandy             In the “normal state of
the world”, trade costs between any pair of CFS areas can be directly infered from the geographical
distance between these CFS areas: τNni = g ni ρ , where the elasticity of trade costs with respect to
distance, ρ, is equal to 0.17, as shown in section 5. From these bilateral trade costs, we obtain the
bilateral resistance terms (BRT) : φni

                                       = (τNni )ε . Knowing all the BRT, we can compute the MRT (ΩNi
and ΦNn ) by solving equation (3.2). For this, we use the contraction mapping algorithm proposed by
Head and Mayer.20 .The total value of exports of region i, Yi , and the total value of imports of region
n, X n , are taken directly from the CFS data. Note that we slightly depart from structural gravity
in the sense that we do not impose Yi = n X ni and X n = i X ni . Our simulations are therefore

   To simulate trade flows during Sandy, we compute a new vector of bilateral trade costs τSni . These
trade costs are obtained from eq. (3.9). Basically, we take the trade costs in the “normal state of the
world” τNni and multiply them by (sni (κ − 1) + 1) to obtain the trade costs during Sandy (τSni ). Once
we have τSni , we apply the same procedure as above to obtain first φni

   Given that our data is quarterly, we need to generate quarterly trade flows. In the first three
quarters, there are no disruptions, hence the simulated quarterly trade flows are simply equal to the
simulated flows for the“normal state of the world”. For t = {1, 2, 3}: Xeni t = Xe N . In the 4th quarter,

Indirect inference estimator      Let us describe in one paragraph the intuition behind our estimator,
before giving a more formal explanation. Firstly, we estimate the vectors of origin and destination
fixed effects, Oi t and Dnt in the real data, and we compute the difference between fixed effects in
the 4th quarter and fixed effects in other quarters. This gives us a vector of parameters, which we
denote θ̂0 . Then, we can simulate trade flows for any value of κ and estimate again the vectors
of origin and destination fixed effects, this time in the simulated data. We compute the difference
between fixed effects in the 4th quarter and fixed effects in other quarters, and we get a new vector
of parameters whose values depend on κ, that we denote θ̂ (κ). Our estimate is the value of κ such
that both vectors of parameters, θ̂0 and θ̂ (κ), are "as close as possible"
   More generally, the intuition of indirect inference estimators is that we estimate parameters from
an "auxiliary model" and look for the value of the parameter(s) of interest such that the parameters
estimated from the auxiliary model with simulated data match parameters estimated from the aux-
iliary model with real data. Here, our auxiliary model is the classical fixed effect specification of the
gravity equation. And the parameters we want to match with simulated data are the time variations
in the origin and destination fixed effects. The fixed effect specification of the gravity equation is
given by the following equation:

                                    ln(X ni t ) = Bni + Dnt + Oi t + "ni t                         (3.10)

   For each CFS area j, we have 4 origin fixed effects O j t (one for each quarter) and 4 destination

   We first estimate the auxiliary model (eq. (3.10)) with real data. We obtain a set of origin and
destination fixed effects, and we compute their time variation as explained above to obtain a vector
θ̂ 0 . This vector is the one we will try to match with our simulated data. Indeed, when we simulate
trade flows, the values of the fixed effects in the 4th quarter depend on κ, because κ changes the
BRT and as a consequence the MRT. Therefore we get a different vector of differences θ for each
value of κ, that we denote θ̂ (κ). Our estimate of the “overcost parameter”, denoted κ̂, is the value
of κ for which θ̂ (κ) is "as close as possible" to θ̂ 0 . In other words, we seek κ such that the distance
between θ̂ 0 and θ̂ (κ) is minimized. This distance between θ̂ 0 and θ̂ (κ) is measured following the
Wald approach:
                                 κ̂ = arg min(θ̂ 0 − θ̂ (κ))0 (θ̂ 0 − θ̂ (κ))

    The estimate of κ that we obtain depends on the duration we assume for the “Sandy state of the
world”, χ. For a duration of 10 days, the overcost parameter is 6.29, which we round down to 6.
Remember that this is a lower bound for the true value of κ. Table 3.2 presents the results of our
estimation for different values of χ


5    Results

Total distance elasticity of trade flows        The estimation of the distance elasticity of trade flows,
ερ is straightforward. We estimate cross-sectional gravity equations, one for each of the three first
quarters of 2012. Let us remind the specification we use:

                                ln(X nis ) = Dns + Ois + ερ ln(g ni ) + "nis

where X nis is the trade flow from i to n in NAICS s, Dns is a destination-NAICS fixed effect, Ois
is an origin-NAICS fixed effect and g ni is the geographical distance between i and n. As explained
previously, , we exclude all shipments exported outside of the US because we do not have information
on their final destination, so that we are not able to determine the distance they cover.
    Table 3.3 shows the results of our estimations of the distance elasticity of trade flows, when
we consider each quarter separately (i.e. we run one distinct regression for each quarter). The
coefficient does not exhibit much volatility over time, which suggests that the link between trade
costs and distance and the elasticity of trade with respect to trade costs are quite stable over time.
The average of the estimates over the three quarters is around -0.84, which lies in the lower part of
the distribution of structural estimates found in Head and Mayer (2014b). This is consistent with the
intuition that the spatial frictions are lower for flows within a country than for international flows.


Transport costs related part of the distance elasticity To estimates of the transport cost part of
distance elasticity (εα), we make use of the variation in transport costs created by Sandy. Let us
remind the specification we use:

                          ln(X nist ) = Oist + Dnst + Bnis + εα ln(δni t ) + "nist

    With the complete sample, we find an elasticity around -0.05 (table 3.4). This unambiguously
leads us to conclude that the part of the distance elasticity of trade flows that can be explained by
transport costs, εα is lower than the total distance elasticity, ερ. Given that ερ = εα+εγ (cf. section
3), it implies that εγ > 0, i.e. there are “dark trade costs” within the US. This conclusion would hold
even if the value of the “overcost parameter”, κ, that we estimated in section 4 was not the right
one, as illustrated in figure 3.7, which plots the estimates of εα as a function of κ (red dots) and
compares them with ερ (blue line). Note that we are not primarily interested in estimating the true
value of εα, an upper bound is sufficient for our main result to hold.
    In the three last columns of table 3.4, we check that our results are robust to the omission of
the dyads for which our measure of change in distance might be more noisy. Such a noisiness might
occur for two reasons. The first reason is that we can not apply our least cost path algorithm to
flows occuring within a given CFS area, as explained in section 2, so instead we simply consider that

the transport costs are multiplied by κ in the “Sandy state of the world”. The second reason is that
the remainders (“rural CFS areas” are often very large; therefore their weighted centroid might be
a poor proxy for the actual origin or destination point of the shipment, and this might ripple into
our measure of the change in transport costs. As a consequence, we exclude alternatively the flows
taking place within CFS areas, keeping only the flows that cross at least one CFS area boundary
(column 2); the flows for which the origin or the destination is a rural CFS area, keeping only the
flows between urban CFS areas (column 3); and both former types of flows together, keeping only the
flows between urban CFS areas that cross at least one CFS area boundary (column 4). Although εα is
estimated somewhat less precisely once these restrictions are imposed (see table 3.4), its magnitude
is not very different, and the main conclusion still unambiguously holds: εα < ερ so there must
exists dark trade costs within the US.
      Our result still holds for extreme assumptions on the duration of the “Sandy state of the world”,
as shown in figure 3.8. Figure 3.8a pictures the results we obtain if we assume that the disruptions
linked to Sandy lasted one single day. In this case, the value of κ we estimate is 7.35, and, for this
value, εα (red dot) is lower in absolute value than ερ (blue line). Similarly, figure 3.8b corresponds
to the assumption that the disruptions caused by Sandy lasted twenty days. In this case, we clearly
see that only part of the total distance elasticity can be explained by transport costs.


5.1     Robustness checks

      Our baseline results lead to the clear conclusion that transport costs cannot account for the whole
distance elasticity of trade flows within the US.


More restrictive definition of the affected areas

      This result is robust to a more restrictive definition of the affected areas. Namely, we consider that
only the counties that benefited from individual assistance (IA) are affected by the hurricane, instead
of taking both the counties benefiting from individual assistance and public assistance (IA/PA). This
amounts to reducing the area in which the transport costs increase because of Sandy.

Postponement or anticipation of some shipments

         Nevertheless, there remains a last subject of concern that could threaten our claim: if shipments
are postponed, the estimates of εα presented in table 3.4 exhibit a downward bias, because some of
the trade destruction effect of the increase in transport costs during Sandy is offset by an increase
in trade after the hurricane. The last part of this paper is therefore devoted to presenting evidence
going against the hypothesis that shipments have been postponed.


Decomposition between intensive and extensive margin If shipments are postponed, then we
expect an increase in the average shipment value for the affected dyads. Indeed, goods that could
not be shipped because of the hurricane should be added to shipments taking place before or af-

More formally, let Nnist denote the number of shipments, then the intensive margin is defined as the

elasticity of   Nnist    with respect to our explanatory variable, δni t , while the extensive margin is the
elasticity of the number of shipments Nnist with respect to δni t . We therefore estimate the following
equations:

    Results are given in tables 3.7 and 3.6. As expected, most of the effect of Sandy went through
the extensive margin, a finding consistent with what Volpe Martincus and Blyde, 2013 observed after
the 2010 Chilean earthquake. The intensive margin was not significantly affected. We interpret this
as evidence against a postponement effect.


Restriction to most regular shipments            Another way to test for the absence of postponement effect
is to focus on shipments that need to be sent regularly, and can hardly be delayed. We do this using
two different methods. The first one consists in selecting the industries that exhibit the most regular
shipment patterns (with the implicit assumption that if they send shipments so regularly, it must
mean that it is hard or costly for them to delay shipments). The second method uses the fact that
some shipments are temperature controlled, and therefore cannot be delayed.


Select the most regular industries We select the industries for which the trade flows are the most
stable over the three first quarters. A natural criterion to determine a low volatility is the coefficient
of variation, i.e. the ratio between the standard-deviation and the mean of trade flows in this NAICS
. However, given the large number of zero trade flows in our data, this coefficient would be very low
for industries for which we have only little observations. Therefore we add another criterion to guide
our decision: the share of zero trade flows. We combine these two criteria to form our regularity
index, giving the same weight to each of them, and select the ten industries with the highest degree
of regularity. A list of the selected industries is given in the appendix, table 3.8. The specification is
the same as for the baseline regression, eq. (3.7). We find that the εα estimated using only the most
regular industries (see table 3.8 below) is slightly higher (in absolute value) than the one estimated
with all industries. Nevertheless, it is still far from ερ, which confirms that transport costs are not
sufficient to explain the whole distance elasticity of trade.

Temperature controlled shipments                 Our CFS data includes a dummy variable indicating whether
the shipment is "temperature controlled", i.e. whether it is carried in a vehicle designed to maintain
the shipment at a certain temperature21 . If a shipment is temperature controlled, it suggests that it
tends to depreciate quickly over time and therefore that it is very costly to postpone it. As a conse-
quence, if there is a postponement effect, then dyad-industries in which there are more temperature
controlled shipments should be less affected by this postponement, and thus have a higher distance
elasticity, because cancelled shipments cannot be postponed. We therefore compute the average
share of temperature controlled shipments during the three first quarters for each dyad-industry and
interact this share with distance. If there is a postponement effect, the coefficient on this interaction
should be negative and significant. We estimate the following specification, where Snis is the share
of temperature controlled shipments during the three first quarters:

                   ln(X nist ) = Bnis + Dnst + Oist + β1 ln(δni t ) + β2 (ln(δni t ) ∗ Snis ) + "nist

6     Conclusion

    Using hurricane Sandy as a natural experiment shifting upwards transport costs in some areas
of the US, we show that transport costs cannot be the sole explanation behind the strong negative

effect of distance on trade flows. More precisely, in our baseline estimation, we find that if transport
costs were the only kind of trade costs correlated with distance, then the distance elasticity of trade
flows within the US should be 14 times lower than what we actually observe. This result is robust
to the exclusion of dyads for which the bilateral change in transport costs that we compute might
have been less accurately determined. It also holds if we choose a more conservative perimeter
for the areas affected by Sandy, or if we consider different durations for the disruptions caused by
the hurricane. Finally, we provide a body of evidence that firms did not advance or postpone their
shipments because of the hurricane, which would have resulted in a downward bias of our results.
   The corollary of this finding is that other types of frictions must relate to distance, the so-called
“dark trade costs”. While a proper identification of the exact nature of these “dark trade costs” is out
of the scope of this paper, we see a promising explanation in the recent developments of the business
networks literature. Firms tend to form links with geographically close firms (Bernard et al., 2019),
and trade flows occur through this supplier-customer network (Chaney, 2018b).

                  We do not consider the variation in dark trade costs Cni , so that the relative variation in trade
costs τni between the two states of the world is equal to the relative variation in transport costs Tni :

                  Therefore, to find the change in trade costs caused by Sandy, we just need to find the change in
transport costs. For this purpose, we rewrite the bilateral transport cost Tni as the product of the
average transport cost per km, denoted E(Tni ), and the geographical distance between i and n , g ni :

                  During the “Sandy state of the world”, transport costs increase in some areas. More precisely,
they are multiplied by the “overcost parameter”, κ. By definition, κ is the ratio between the transport

                                                     κ=
                                                          E(Tni |ID = 0)

where ID is a dummy variable equal to one when the concerned road segment is within an affected
county (IA/PA county) and the state of the world is Sandy. The average transport cost per km in the
“Sandy state of the world” is a weighted average of the transport cost per km in affected areas and
the transport cost per km in non affected areas. The weights correspond to the share of the itinerary
going through affected areas, sni 22 and the share of the itinerary going through non affected areas,
1 − sni :
                                    S
                                 E(Tni ) = sni E(Tni |ID = 1) + (1 − sni ) E(Tni |ID = 0)

which can be rewritten as:

                                  S
                               E(Tni ) = sni κ E(Tni |ID = 0) + (1 − sni ) E(Tni |ID = 0)
                                        = (sni (κ − 1) + 1) E(Tni |ID = 0)

    In the normal state of the world, ID = 0 everywhere, so the average transport cost is equal to the
average transport cost in non affected areas: E(TniN ) = E(Tni |ID = 0). Therefore :

                                               S
                                            E(Tni ) = (sni (κ − 1) + 1) E(TniN )
                                                  S
                                                 Tni = (sni (κ − 1) + 1) TniN
                                                τSni = (sni (κ − 1) + 1) τNni

    Ideally, we should redetermine the optimal path for each value of κ, because both g ni and sni are
affected by κ. However, for technical feasibility reasons, we have to disregard this path adjustment,
so that both sni and g ni are constant. In other words, for the estimation of κ (and only for this part
of our work), we assume that agents do not change their path, whatever the value of κ. While not
realistic, this hypothesis does not compromise our main results because we deliberately choose the
path in such a way that κ will be underestimated. This downward bias on κ is obtained by using
an upper bound for sni instead of the real value of sni . Indeed, overestimating the share of itinerary
affected by the hurricane leads to overestimate the effect of κ on trade flows and as a consequence
to underestimate κ. To find an upper bound for sni , we modify our road raster so that the cost of
passing through a road cell in an IA/PA area is 10−6 whereas this cost for a road cell outside IA/PA
areas is left unaltered at 1. As a consequence, the least cost path algorithm will choose the path that
includes the largest possible share within IA/PA areas. We plot the distribution of sni in figure 3.10.

 Trois Essais sur les Frictions Spatiales

   Les frictions spatiales jouent un rôle crucial dans l’explication de nombreux phénomènes écono-
miques. Dans cette thèse, nous étudions les origines, la prévalence et les conséquences de telles
frictions à travers trois exemples.
   Dans le premier chapitre, nous nous intéressons aux frictions spatiales pesant sur la diffusion de la
connaissance. Nous expliquons l’effet négatif de la distance sur les flux de citations entre brevets par
la structure des réseaux d’innovation. Nous montrons que la connaissance percole: les entreprises
tendent à citer davantage les nouveaux brevets de leurs contacts existants, et à former de nouveaux
liens avec des contacts de leurs contacts. Incorporer cette percolation dans un modèle de formation
de réseau permet de rationaliser le lien négatif entre diffusion de la connaissance et distance.
   Dans le second chapitre, nous explorons les liens entre frictions informationnelles et commerce
international. Nous utilisons le contexte spécifique du XIXe siècle, au cours duquel émergent des
agences de presse mondiales, facilitant l’acquisition par les acteurs économiques d’informations sur
les marchés étrangers. Nous montrons que deux pays commercent davantage une fois qu’ils béné-
ficient de ce choc positif sur la capacité à obtenir de l’information. Les agences de presse s’insèrent
donc parmi les nombreux facteurs explicatifs de la Première Mondialisation.
   Le dernier chapitre cherche à déterminer si les coûts de transport constituent l’essentiel des ob-
stacles au commerce à l’intérieur d’un pays. Alors qu’en matière de commerce international il est
établi que les coûts du commerce ne se limitent pas aux coûts de transport, on dispose de moins
d’éléments pour le commerce intra-national. Nous utilisons l’ouragan Sandy comme une expérience
naturelle à l’origine d’une hausse des coûts de transport pour les flux transitant par certaines zones,
et montrons que l’élasticité intra-USA des flux commerciaux à la distance serait bien plus faible si les
coûts de transport étaient les seuls responsables de cette élasticité.


Chapitre 1: La Percolation de la Connaissance dans l’Espace

   Malgré les améliorations considérables des technologies de l’information et de la communication
au cours des trois dernières décennies, la distance géographique demeure un obstacle majeur à la
diffusion de la connaissance. Nous estimons l’élasticité des flux internationaux de citations de brevets
par rapport à la distance et trouvons qu’elle est restée stable entre 1980 et 2010, fluctuant autour
de −0.3, ce qui signifie qu’une hausse de 10% de la distance entre deux pays est associée à une
diminution de 3% des flux de citations entre ces deux pays. L’existence d’une élasticité négative
et statistiquement significative est surprenante puisque les idées ne sont pas soumises aux frictions
spatiales habituellement associées à la distance, telles que les coûts de transport où les droits de
douane. La stabilité de cette élasticité interroge dans la mesure où la digitalisation et les technologies
de communication, avec par exemple l’émergence d’outils de recherche en ligne des brevets, semblent
n’avoir eu aucun effet sur les tendances agrégées de diffusion de la connaissance.
   Ce chapitre montre que la dynamique de formation des réseaux au cours du cycle de vie de
l’entreprise est cruciale pour la compréhension de l’effet agrégé de la distance: les entreprises jeunes
de taille modeste ont des contacts spatialement proches, et leur réseau s’étend graduellement à
mesure qu’elles croissent.
   Notre contribution intervient en deux étapes. Dans un premier temps, nous étudions la manière
dont se forment les liens entre innovateurs: nous mettons en évidence un phénomène appelé en

économie des réseaux “fermeture triadique”, propriété selon laquelle les entreprises tendent à former
davantage de liens avec des entreprises situées à deux nœuds de distance dans le réseau (en d’autres
termes, avec des contacts de contacts). Pour dévoiler ce mécanisme, nous reconstituons le réseau
à partir des citations de brevet, et évaluons l’influence de ce réseau sur la probabilité de formation
d’un nouveau lien. Cela nous permet d’établir que les entreprises se réfèrent plus facilement à des
connaissances générées par des entreprises qu’elles ont déjà citées dans le passé (leurs contacts),
ainsi que par des entreprises citées par des entreprises qu’elles ont déjà citées (les contacts de leurs
contacts). Ce processus de diffusion rappelle le phénomène de percolation en physique, puisque les
idées apparaissent comme un fluide trouvant son chemin d’un innovateur à l’autre en suivant les
liens d’un réseau.
    Cette mise en évidence de la diffusion des idées entre entreprises via leur réseau proche repose sur
une stratégie d’identification inédite. Nous utilisons le fait que certaines citations sont faites par le de-
mandeur du brevet lui-même, tandis que d’autres sont ajoutées par l’examinateur du brevet. L’union
de ces deux ensembles correspond aux citations qui auraient été réalisées dans un monde contre-
factuel sans friction sur la diffusion de la connaissance. Nous estimons l’effet d’un lien direct sur
la probabilité d’être cité par l’entreprise déposant le brevet elle-même, plutôt que par l’examinateur
du brevet. Nos résultats montrent que les entreprises ont une probabilité 1.5 fois plus élevée que
les examinateurs de citer des brevets détenus par leurs contacts, avec des effets hétérogènes selon
la taille de l’entreprise. En outre, les entreprises ont une probabilité 35% plus élevée de citer des
brevets qui ont été auparavant directement cités par leurs contacts. Ces effets persistent lors de la
réalisation d’une large gamme de tests de robustesse.
    Dans un deuxième temps, nous montrons les conséquences de ce mécanisme de formation des
réseaux lorsque l’on adopte un point de vue plus agrégé, et en particulier comment il est suffisant
pour expliquer l’effet de la distance sur les flux de connaissance. Pour ce faire, nous incorporons le
processus de diffusion décrit ci-dessus dans un modèle. Les entreprises y croissent car leur réseau
s’étend au fil du temps. Elles sont de moins en moins affectées par la distance à mesure que leur
taille et leur âge augmentent, car elles ont eu davantage de temps pour étendre leur réseau. Ce
modèle débouche sur deux prédictions, l’une sur la distribution des tailles des entreprises, l’autre
sur la relation entre taille de l’entreprise et distance des citations de cette entreprise, qui combinées
génèrent un effet agrégé de la distance. La première prédiction est que la distribution des tailles des
innovateurs suit une loi de Pareto. La deuxième est qu’une fonction puissance lie la moyenne des
carrés des distances auxquelles l’entreprise cite et la taille de l’entreprise.
    Ces prédictions sont vérifiées dans les données. En plus d’être suffisantes pour générer une
élasticité négative et constante, elles constituent en elles-mêmes des faits stylisés dignes d’intérêt.
En effet, nous montrons que, au-delà d’une loi de Pareto, la distribution des tailles des innovateurs est
empiriquement bien décrite par une loi de Zipf, ce qui la rattache aux nombreux objets économiques
suivant cette loi. De la même manière, l’existence d’une relation systématique entre la taille d’un
innovateur et la distance à laquelle se situe la connaissance qu’il utilise n’était pas documentée jusqu’à
présent, et nous montrons en outre que cette relation est vérifiée dans des contextes variés, tant en
cross-section qu’en panel.
    Une conclusion importante de ce chapitre est que les petites entreprises sont les principales con-
tributrices à l’effet agrégé de la distance. Au début de leur cycle de vie, les innovateurs mobilisent



                                                     5


des connaissances produites par des contacts situés près d’eux, et au fur et à mesure de leur crois-
sance ils tissent des liens avec des innovateurs plus lointains à travers leur réseau. Nous trouvons
que malgré la stabilité de l’effet de la distance au cours du temps, le lien entre taille et distance s’est
amoindri pendant la période que nous étudions, en grande partie parce que les petits innovateurs
sont devenus capables d’accéder à des connaissances plus lointaines. Cela aurait dû induire une
baisse de l’effet global de la distance, mais semble avoir été compensé par une hausse de la part des
petits innovateurs au détriment des grands innovateurs.
   Le mécanisme de formation du réseau que nous mettons en évidence est suffisamment général
pour englober la plupart des explications habituellement avancées pour le caractère local des trans-
ferts de connaissance: il peut correspondre à des accords formels de collaboration R&D, mais égale-
ment à des liens associés à une proximité culturelle ou ethnique (Agrawal et al., 2008; Kerr, 2008), à
une mobilité inter-entreprises des ingénieurs (Almeida and Kogut, 1999; Breschi and Lissoni, 2009;
Serafinelli, 2019) ou à des relations fournisseur-client (Carvalho and Voigtländer, 2014).


Chapitre 2: Information et Première Mondialisation: Agences de Presse
et Commerce

   Comme la connaissance, l’information ne se diffuse pas parfaitement d’un pays à l’autre. Ces
frictions informationnelles sont susceptibles de constituer une entrave aux échanges internationaux,
puisque la connaissance des caractéristiques des marchés étrangers (taille, prix, coûts du commerce
et autres déterminants de la demande) est cruciale pour les exportateurs, et que pour les importateurs
le choix du fournisseur dépend de l’information disponible sur les prix et la qualité des produits de
différents marchés.
   Dans le second chapitre, nous utilisons l’exemple historique de l’émergence des agences de presse
mondiales pour quantifier les effets sur les flux commerciaux d’une facilitation de la circulation de
l’information.
   Les agences de presse collectent de l’information et la revendent aux médias (dans notre con-
texte, des journaux). Elles leur permettent d’enrichir leur contenu sur des pays qu’ils ne seraient pas
capables de couvrir par leurs propres moyens. Au milieu du XIXe siècle, avec l’essor de la presse
de masse, apparaissent les premières agences de presse mondiales. Le marché se structure rapi-
dement sous la forme d’un oligopole où trois agences de presse dominantes s’entendent pour se
partager les marchés nationaux. Dans ce cadre, elles s’accordent pour partager leurs informations
et dissuader ainsi l’entrée de potentiels concurrents en s’assurant une information plus exhaustive
que celle d’agences exclues de l’accord. Lorsque deux pays sont couverts par des agences de presse
membres de cet accord, l’information circule donc plus facilement entre eux.
   Le développement des agences de presse est intimement lié à la construction d’un réseau télé-
graphique international: les agences de presse utilisaient le télégraphe pour communiquer et ont
fréquemment contribué à son expansion. Le télégraphe représentait une amélioration considérable
par rapport aux précédentes technologies de communication, avec des délais de transmission plus
courts et moins volatils. Cependant, bien qu’il rende les communications plus faciles, il ne donne pas
accès en tant que tel à une source centralisée et fiable d’informations publiques. En effet, les messages
télégraphiques sont privés, et il est facile d’en restreindre l’accès à quelques utilisateurs. A l’inverse,


                                                    6


les agences de presse collectent et vendent de l’information qui peut ensuite être utilisée par chacun
à un coût quasi nul. En d’autres termes, en l’absence d’agences de presse, les télégraphes réduisent
les coûts de coordination et de communication, sans grand effet sur la quantité d’information dont
dispose un large public. Nous utilisons cette distinction entre un usage du télégraphe facilement
exclusif et la nature quasi publique de l’information fournie par les agences de presse pour séparer
l’effet d’une baisse des coûts de coordination / communication de l’effet d’une amélioration de l’accès
à l’information publique, une séparation que les précédentes études n’avaient pas la possibilité de
faire.
    Tous les pays n’ont pas été couverts simultanément par les télégraphes et les agences de presse.
Bien que le succès du télégraphe ait été immédiat, le coût des infrastructures et des facteurs tech-
niques ont rendu impossible une connexion rapide de l’ensemble des pays. De la même manière,
les agences de presse mondiales n’ont pas immédiatement étendu leurs opérations au monde entier.
Elles ont commencé par se partager l’Europe, et ont ensuite graduellement élargi le rayon de leur
accord en cinq vagues successives, en 1859, 1867, 1876, 1889 et 1902. Cette entrée séquentielle
des paires de pays dans le réseau des agences de presse et du télégraphe est clé pour notre stratégie
d’identification, puisqu’elle nous permet d’estimer une équation de gravité en panel, avec en plus des
habituels effets fixes “origine × année” et “destination × année” des effets fixes “paire de pays” qui
contrôlent pour toutes les caractéristiques constantes au cours du temps des deux pays. Nos estimés
reflètent donc l’augmentation des flux associée au choc positif d’information, purgée entre autres
des variations agrégées de production de l’exportateur ou de dépenses de l’importateur, ainsi que de
tout déterminant statique des flux commerciaux.
    Notre approche pour capturer le pur effet de l’information est de de nous concentrer sur l’interaction
entre télégraphe et agences de presse: alors que l’effet du télégraphe traduit la diminution des coûts
de communication, l’interaction isole spécifiquement la contribution d’une amélioration de l’accès à
l’information entre les deux pays. L’effet est substantiel: nous estimons que la valeur des flux com-
merciaux augmente de 30% supplémentaires lorsque deux pays sont inclus dans le réseau global de
partage des nouvelles, en plus d’être reliés par le télégraphe. Nos résultats confirment également les
estimés de précédentes études qui documentaient l’effet positif du télégraphe sur le commerce: nous
trouvons que, en l’absence de couverture par une agence de presse, les flux commerciaux augmentent
de 40% lorsque deux pays deviennent connectés par le télégraphe. Cependant, les agences de presse,
en l’absence de télégraphe, ne sont pas associées à une hausse significative du commerce, ce qui sug-
gère qu’elles étaient incapables d’opérer de manière satisfaisante lorsqu’elles étaient privées d’une
technologie de communication adéquate.
    Nous analysons ensuite la dynamique temporelle de l’effet à travers une “event-study”, et trou-
vons que sa magnitude augmente progressivement, jusqu’à une trentaine d’années après la connex-
ion de la dyade. Cette image est cohérente avec la lente constitution de réseaux commerciaux entre
les pays qui ont bénéficié d’un accès amélioré à l’information. Enfin, nous mettons en évidence des
résultats soutenant l’hypothèse que le surcroît de commerce est bien lié à une information plus abon-
dante sur les pays étrangers concernés. En premier lieu, les flux bilatéraux deviennent plus volatils
après que les deux pays sont connectés. Comme Steinwender, 2018 le montre, cette observation
est cohérente avec un scénario où les partenaires s’adaptent davantage aux conditions du marché.
Deuxièmement, en utilisant un corpus de textes de journaux français, nous mesurons une augmen-

tation du nombre de mentions d’un pays étranger dans la presse française lorsque l’une des agences
de presse mondiales commence à opérer dans ce pays et lorsqu’il devient relié à la France par une
liaison télégraphique.
   La diminution des frictions informationnelles est ainsi l’un des nombreux facteurs ayant con-
tribué à la hausse soutenue des échanges internationaux pendant la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle
(la “Première Globalisation”). Bien qu’obtenu à partir d’un évènement historique distant, ce résultat
reste pertinent pour analyser le commerce contemporain, puisque l’information n’est toujours pas
complète en dépit des améliorations considérables apportées aux technologies de communication.
Ce chapitre ne tranche pas sur le mécanisme précis par lequel une hausse de la quantité d’information
disponible affecte le commerce. Cependant, le fait que l’effet continue à augmenter progressivement
pendant une longue période suggère que l’amélioration de la circulation de l’information a pu action-
ner des mécanismes agissant sur une durée longue, tels que les Investissements Directs à l’Etranger,
les migrations humaines internationales ou même une convergence des goûts culturels.


Chapitre 3: Commerce et Coûts de Transport: l’Exemple de l’Ouragan
Sandy

   Les flux de commerce internationaux décroissent fortement lorsque la distance augmente, et
seule une partie de cette baisse peut être attribuée aux coûts de transport. Cela témoigne de la
présence d’autres coûts du commerce, “noirs” car non observables mais nécessaires pour expliquer
la structure gravitaire des flux commerciaux (Head and Mayer, 2013). Les sources potentielles de
ces frictions sont multiples. Elles incluent par exemples des différences de goût ou de culture, un
manque de confiance mutuelle, et l’imparfaite diffusion spatiale de l’information (évoquée dans les
deux premiers chapitres). On s’attend à ce que ces ces coûts noirs du commerce soient moins élevés
au sein d’un pays qu’entre les pays: la culture et les goûts y sont plus similaires, l’information s’y
diffuse plus facilement, et la confiance mutuelle y est plus importante. En outre, les droits de douane
et autres coûts “gris” (barrières non tarifaires) associés au franchissement d’une frontière nationale y
sont absents. Néanmoins, ce chapitre montre qu’une partie seulement de l’élasticité à la distance des
flux commerciaux internes aux USA peut être attribuée aux coûts de transport, impliquant l’existence
de sources additionnelles de frictions spatiales à l’intérieur même des pays.
   Plus précisément, nous trouvons que si l’élasticité totale des flux intra-USA à la distance est de
−0.84, cette élasticité serait bien plus faible, autour de −0.06, si les coûts de transport étaient les
seuls obstacles au commerce. Ce résultat est établi à l’aide d’une expérience naturelle: l’ouragan
Sandy, qui a frappé le Nord-Est des Etats-Unis fin octobre 2012. Cet ouragan a causé des dommages
majeurs sur les infrastructures routières, à l’origine d’une hausse des coûts de transport dans les
secteurs touchés. En fonction du chemin optimal les reliant, certaines paires de villes (dyades) sont
plus affectées que d’autres: les dyades pour lesquelles une part importante du trajet habituel traverse
les zones dévastées par l’ouragan subissent une hausse de coût de transport plus importante que les
dyades pour lesquelles ce trajet évite les zones touchées. Par exemple, les coûts de transport entre
Los Angeles et Seattle ne sont pas affectés, alors que les coûts de transport entre Boston et Miami
le sont. Nous calculons une borne inférieure pour l’équivalent en termes de distance routière de
ce changement de coûts de transport et régressons dans une équation de gravité en panel les flux


                                                   8


commerciaux intra-USA sur cette mesure de distance qui varie au cours du temps. L’effet de la
distance obtenu ainsi est plus faible que l’effet de la distance obtenu par l’estimation d’une équation
de gravité en cross-section, ce qui confirme que l’élasticité des flux à la distance en cross-section
incorpore des coûts du commerce distincts des coûts de transport.
   Le changement de coûts de transport induit par Sandy est calculé à partir d’un algorithme de plus
court chemin. Nous décomposons le réseau routier américain en une grille, où le franchissement de
chaque cellule est associée à un coût, et cherchons le chemin entre deux points pour lequel le coût
est minimisé. Un paramètre clé dont nous avons besoin pour évaluer les effets de Sandy est le
“paramètre de surcoût”, qui indique dans quelle mesure le coût de franchissement augmente dans
les zones affectées par Sandy. Ce paramètre est estimé par une méthode d’inférence indirecte: nous
minimisons la différence entre des moments observés et des moments prédits par un modèle de
gravité structurelle.
   Notre résultat sur l’incapacité des coûts de transport seuls à expliquer l’ensemble de l’élasticité
des flux à la distance à l’intérieur des USA reste valide lorsque l’on exclut les dyades pour lesquelles
le changement de coût de transport bilatéral que nous calculons pourrait être moins précis. Il sub-
siste également si nous optons pour un périmètre plus restrictif pour définir les zones affectées par
Sandy, ou sous différentes hypothèses sur la durée des dommages causés par l’ouragan. En outre,
nous montrons que les entreprises n’ont ni avancé ni reculé dans le temps leurs envois en raison de
l’ouragan, ce qui aurait été à l’origine d’un biais à la baisse de nos résultats. En revanche, nous lais-
sons ouverte pour des recherches ultérieures la question de l’identification précise des mécanismes
par lesquels ces coûts noirs du commerce opèrent.
