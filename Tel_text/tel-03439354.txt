Acknowledgements

I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to my advisor, Thomas Chaney, for his trust, availability,
and tremendous support. Thomas is the most passionate and enthusiastic researcher I have
ever met. His insatiable curiosity and creative approach to research are extremely contagious.
They have inspired me deeply during all these years and will continue to do so. Thomas
always encouraged me to explore my own research ideas, no matter how dubious they seemed
at first glance, while guiding me with his invaluable insights. I am proud – and fortunate –
to have worked under his supervision.

I am also extremely grateful to Thierry Mayer for his support throughout my thesis. Having
the chance to collaborate with him was an immense honor and – I must say – an intimi-
dating experience. He guided me through the vast literature in international trade and the
estimation of gravity equations, which was decisive for my work and my development as a
researcher. Thierry also taught me that bouldering at Fontainebleau is an effective way to
escape the tumultuous world of research for a weekend, which was often needed.

I want to thank Maria Cecilia Bustamante and Isabelle Méjean for accepting to read and
review my dissertation. It is a great honor for me and of tremendous benefit to my research
to have them in my thesis committee.

I am indebted to my co-authors Yasser Boualam, Anne Duquerroy, Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier
and Daniel Paravisini. This adventure would not have been as rich and fruitful without them.
Special thanks to Clément Malgouyres, who passed on to me his pure and visceral love for
economics. I have never met anyone so good – and so obsessed – with micro data, and I am
proud of what we have achieved together. I would love to continue to be woken up in the
middle of the night by his flurry of messages about CES production functions.

I discovered economics in the thrilling intellectual atmosphere of the economics department
at Sciences Po and I am grateful to the entire faculty there. I would especially like to thank
Florian Oswald and Michele Fioretti. Florian introduced me to the joy of Julia and gave

me the opportunity to teach his Numerical Methods class. Intense discussions with Michele
gave me both ideas and confidence; I am proud and excited to share research projects with
him. I also feel lucky to have had the opportunity to interact with many brilliant PhD
students at Sciences Po and I would like to thank them for the inspiring exchanges we had
along the way. Here are some, though I am afraid not all, of the people that were part
of these interactions: Tyler Abbot, Vladimir Avetian, Olivier Cassagneau-Francis, Sophie
Cetre, Pierre Cotterlaz-Carraz, Cyril Couaillier, Nicolo Dalvit, Samuel Delpeuch, Pierre
Deschamps, Edgard Dewitte, Jean-Benoı̂t Eyméoud, Etienne Fize, Arthur Guillouzouic-le-
Corff, Dorian Henricot, Jean-Louis Keene, Gustave Kenedi, Alaı̈s Martin-Baillon, Julia Mink,
Elisa Mougin, Ludovic Panon, Asem Patel, Stefan Pauly, Jan Sonntag, Charles Louis-Sidois,
Camille Urvoy, Paul Vertier and Max Viskanic. I would also like to warmly thank Pilar
Calvo, Hadjila Nezlioui Serraz, Claudine Lamaze and Sandrine LeGoff for their invaluable
help at all stages of my thesis.

A significant part of this journey took place at Banque de France, at the Service des Analyses
Microéconomiques that welcomed me five years ago. I am deeply thankful to Frédérique Sav-
ignac, Erwan Gautier and Vincent Bignon for their constant support throughout these years.
This thesis would not have been possible without them. I am grateful to Nicoletta Berardi for
having kindly guided my first steps in this crazy research world. I am also grateful to Math-
ias Lé for our impassioned discussions and debriefings of the Lakers games and for his gentle
taunts when I experienced dreadful doubts about my thesis. I would like to thank Laurent
Baudry for his tremendous help with the data and his attention to detail that inspired me
so much. I am also grateful to Pamfili Antipa, Clémence Berson, Antoine Berthou, Jocelyn
Boussard, Simon Bunel, Juan Carluccio, Barbara Castillo Rico, Audrey Deffaux, Françoise
Drumetz, Bertrand Garbinti, Paul Hubert, Lisa Kerdelhué, Pauline Lesterquy, Noëmie Li-
sack, Jérémi Montornès, Sandra Nevoux, Lionel Potier, Loriane Py, Aurélie Sotura, Gabriel
Smagghue, Sylvie Tarrieu and Riccardo Zago for the endless discussions that greatly con-
tributed to this thesis. I would also like to thank everyone at Collège de France. I am
particularly honored to have had the opportunity to meet and work with Philippe Aghion,
who welcomed me warmly into this prestigious institution.

I am also grateful to Frédéric Lordon. Had I never met him, I probably would not have
started a thesis. The reading of his books, and his kind advice made me completely change
the course of my life almost ten years ago. Frédéric awoke in me an intellectual enthusiasm
for social sciences that never left. I hope he will forgive me for acknowledging him in a thesis
that begins with a quote from George J. Stigler. As a forker, I owe him a lot.

I could not have made it through these years of academic joy and despair without a bunch

                                               6


of incredible friends. Malo EG and My-Lan (and now Thao!) who kept reminding me that
simple things – randomly: the Olympique de Marseille, a fresh beer or Keny Arkana – were
more important than all this mess. Stéphane and Verity who made me travel from Inverness
to Lourmarin. Nazim for the epic ball games and those marvelous, existential and fiery
debates at 194 DMS. Édouard and Antonin, who brightened my everyday life with their
caustic humor and profound intelligence. And thanks to the infamous Crook Chess Club
for the dreams haunted by pawns and knights. Because some places are as comforting as
good friends: I am grateful to Ceillac, where I could escape to the summits and Ladon. A
substantial part of my thesis was written in front of those magnificent birch trees.

I would like to thank my beloved family and especially my parents, Cathy and Yves, for
their unconditional love and support. They gave me the strength and confidence to get here.

Finally, all this would not make any sense without Lydie. She was by my side through the
very ups and the very downs, when her sonorous laughter and her contagious, sunny smile
were the best remedies for my insane anxieties. I am so lucky to have you in my life.

Note to the Reader

The four chapters of this dissertation are self-contained research articles and can be read
separately. They are preceded by an introduction which summarizes the research presented
in this dissertation. The terms “paper” or “article” are used to refer to chapters. Chapter 2,
3 and 4 are co-authored, which explains the use of the “we” pronoun.

Introduction

        “One should hardly have to tell academicians that information is a valuable
        resource: knowledge is power. And yet it occupies a slum dwelling in the
        town of economics. Mostly it is ignored.”

                                 – George J. Stigler, The Economics of Information


        ime has passed since George J. Stigler’s seminal article (Stigler, 1961), in which the

T         1982 Nobel prize winner lamented the lack of research on the topic of information.
          This complaint is now obsolete: in sixty years, the notion of information has pene-
trated a wide range of research fields in economics. It is now recognized that information is
imperfect, obtaining information can be costly and there are important asymmetries of in-
formation. The four chapters of this dissertation make an attempt to extend our knowledge
on how imperfect information affects both credit and goods markets, by leveraging micro
data. I first contextualize each chapter separately. A detailed description of the chapters is
then provided.

One early strand of the literature on information has focused on information acquisition and
developed search models in which individuals incur costs to acquire information (McCall,
1970; Diamond, 1971), thus departing from the abstraction of Walrasian markets in which
the price adjusts instantaneously to equilibrate demand and supply. This line of research
eventually evolved into the matching-and-bargaining and directed-search models that are
now widely used in labor macroeconomics (see Rogerson et al., 2005 for a survey), monetary
theory (Kiyotaki and Wright, 1993), financial economics (Duffie et al., 2005; Weill, 2007), ur-
ban economics (see Zenou, 2009 for a monograph) and for the analysis of the marriage market
(Mortensen, 1988; Shimer and Smith, 2000). An emerging branch of this vast literature has
recently highlighted the prominence of search frictions in (international) goods trade (Rauch,
2001; Chaney, 2014; Allen, 2014; Lenoir et al., 2018), acknowledging that it takes time and
resources for an exporter to learn about market conditions elsewhere, to find customers

abroad or, symmetrically for an importer to match with the right supplier. Furthermore,
this literature has also documented how the diffusion of information and communication
technologies (ICTs) reduced such frictions (Jensen, 2007; Aker, 2010; Goyal, 2010; Lendle
et al., 2016; Steinwender, 2018; Akerman et al., 2018; Bhuller et al., 2019). Chapter 1 and
Chapter 4 of this dissertation directly contribute to this strand of the literature.

The contribution of chapter 1 is to extend the study of search frictions to credit markets.
Motivated by empirical evidence I document on local credit markets in France, I propose a
theory of firm-bank matching, subject to search frictions. Firms exert significant efforts to
locate and match with the right banking partner. Upon matching, agency frictions hinder
banks’ ability to optimally screen and monitor projects. I structurally estimate my model
on French data using the staggered roll-out of Broadband Internet, from 1997 to 2007, as a
shock that reduced search frictions. I confirm the model predictions that the allocation of
credit was affected by this shock. Finally, I use the structure of my model to quantify the
impact of this technology-induced reduction in search frictions on loan prices. I find that
broadband internet access reduced the cost of debt for small businesses by 4.9% over the
period. In chapter 4, which is joint work with Clément Malgouyres and Thierry Mayer, we
study the role of Broadband Internet in reducing search frictions faced by French importers.
We document the presence of “technology-induced” trade in France between 1997 and 2007
and assess its impact on consumer welfare. We use the staggered roll-out of broadband
internet to estimate its causal effect on the importing behavior of affected firms. Using an
event-study design, we find that broadband expansion increases firm-level imports by around
25%. We further find that the “sub-extensive” margin (number of products and sourcing
countries per firm) is the main channel of adjustment and that the effect is larger for capital
goods.

In parallel with the study of information acquisition, a largely separate literature considers
environments with limited strategic interactions and has identified the crucial importance
of asymmetric information (Akerlof, 1970; Spence, 1973; Stiglitz, 1975; Stiglitz and Weiss,
1981), that occurs in transactions where one party has more or better information than the
other. In particular, the core ideas about asymmetric information developed in the 1970s
continue to play a key role in the analysis of banking and corporate finance. This literature
has long highlighted the role of bank-firm relationships in alleviating agency frictions and
shaping credit supply (for surveys see, e.g., Boot, 2000; Degryse et al., 2009; Udell, 2015), as
banks develop close relationships with borrowers over time which facilitates monitoring and
screening. In chapter 2, co-authored with Anne Duquerroy, Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier and
Daniel Paravisini, we show that differentiation and specialization may also allow banks to


                                              24


reduce information asymmetries and gain market power. Using micro-data of the universe of
bank-SME relationships in France, we document that banks specialize locally (at the branch
level) by industry, and that this specialization shapes the equilibrium amount of borrowing
by small firms. For identification, we exploit the reallocation of local clients from closed-
down branches to nearby branches of the same bank, which induced quasi-random variation
in the match between a firm’s industry and the industry of specialization of the lending
branch. We show that branch reallocation leads, on average, to a substantial and permanent
decline in small firm borrowing. This decline is twice larger for firms whose accounts are
reallocated from branches less specialized in their industry than the original one.

Finally, in chapter 3, which is joint work with Yasser Boualam, we study the implication
of both agency and search frictions on credit allocation from a macroeconomic standpoint.
The common view across most macro-finance models abstracts from the long-term nature of
financial contracts and any market frictions that may prevent banks from costlessly forming
or severing these credit matches. These models thus downplay the value of relationships
and their aggregate consequences and imply that banks can swiftly adjust their number
of borrowers in response to shocks. We propose a novel macro perspective on the process
of credit intermediation. It aims to provide further empirical evidence on the key and
distinctive roles played by both the intensive and extensive margins in shaping aggregate
credit fluctuations. Here, we attempt to look behind such fluctuations in order to address
first-order questions such as: (i) When aggregate bank credit declines by 5%, is it because
the average loan size (i.e., intensive margin) drops by 5%, or is it because 5% of bank-
firm matches (i.e., extensive margin) are destroyed? (ii) Does the origin of aggregate credit
fluctuations matter? (iii) Do monetary policy shocks impact these margins differently? I
now turn to a more detailed description of each chapter.


Chapter 1: Search Frictions in Credit Markets
It is costly for firms to locate and match with the right banking partner, especially for
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who devote time and resources to this search
process. Small firms commonly multiply loan applications (2.7 on average) and undergo a
time-consuming application process: over 33 hours are spent on loan request paperwork.
Overall, about one third of SMEs deplore a difficult and lengthy credit application process.
While the effect of informational asymmetries on credit allocation has been well documented
(e.g., Akerlof, 1970; Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981; Petersen and Rajan, 1995), little is known
about how search frictions affect bank-firm matching and access to credit. Understanding


                                             25


the role of search frictions is particularly important to policy makers, not only as recent
developments in information technology and digitisation in the banking industry are likely
to affect search frictions, but also as policies that reduce search costs may differ substantially
from policies that reduce traditional agency frictions.

The first contribution of the paper is to develop a theory of firm-bank matching subject to
informational frictions. This theory is motivated by new stylized facts I uncover on local
credit markets in France: I use a unique data set on small business lending from 1998 to
2005 to document several patterns in the observed loan prices, bank branches heterogeneity
and credit flows across cities that suggest, along with survey evidence, the presence of search
frictions in credit markets. I then develop a partial equilibrium model of firm-bank matching
that is able to capture and explain the observed patterns in the data.1 The model features
two-sided heterogeneity – bank branches and firms – and information frictions of two kinds.
First, search frictions hinder firms ability to locate and match with the right financing
partner. Second and upon matching, informational asymmetries affect banks ability to
screen and monitor projects. By adding structure to the search and matching process, I
generate a number of theoretical predictions linking the level of search frictions to (i) the
cost of debt for small businesses, (ii) credit flows between cities and (iii) the dynamic of firm-
bank matching. In particular, when search costs decrease firms meet with more potential
lenders and eventually borrow credit at a lower rate.

The second contribution of the paper is to take the model to the data. I structurally test the
main predictions of my model using the staggered diffusion of Broadband Internet (BI) in
France, from 1999 to 2007, as a shock on search frictions. I then use my empirical estimates
to quantify a technology-induced reduction in the cost of debt for French SMEs, along the
lines of my model. The large diffusion of information and communication technologies has
indeed represented a profound change for the banking industry and Broadband Internet was
the catalyst for this numerical transformation. As digitization proceeded apace, transaction
costs decreased and the rise of online financial services allowed firms to search for the best
banking partner in a faster and more efficient way, leading to structural changes in banking
markets (Hauswald and Marquez, 2003). Kroszner and Strahan (1999) showed how the
large adoption of information technology reduced the dependence on geographical proximity
between customers and banks, and Petersen and Rajan (2002) documented the erosion of
the local nature of small business lending, with increasing distance between small firms and
their lenders in the United States but also new communication habits. Similar trends are
observed in France: inter-regional credit flows have grown by 15% and the average firm-bank
  1
      From a modeling standpoint, my approach is in the spirit of Eaton et al. (2018) and Lenoir et al. (2018).


                                                       26


distance has increased by 10% between 1998 and 2005. My empirical approach provide a
causal interpretation for those facts, suggesting that innovations in information technology –
namely, Broadband Internet diffusion – have reduced the role of both transaction and search
costs in shaping credit outcomes, allowing firms to search for credit further and leading to
structural changes in local credit markets.

Identifying the causal effect of new technology adoption on firm-bank matching and credit
outcomes is difficult because of its endogeneity. The French data and context allow me to
make progress on the causal identification of how technology affects search frictions in credit
markets and, in turn, firm-bank matching and credit flows. The third contribution of the
paper is that I propose a novel instrument variable strategy for the timing of Broadband
Internet expansion, that is based on a theoretical optimal investment plan for infrastructure
upgrading. I use a dataset on Broadband Internet availability at the municipality level
over the 1999-2007 period compiled by Malgouyres (2017) and combine it with information
regarding population density and existing telecommunication infrastructures, namely local
copper loops networks and large fiber optic cables. Because Broadband Internet operators
relied on these already existing infrastructures to gradually deploy Broadband, I show that
the optimal timing of Broadband availability can be predicted using this data, without
additional information regarding local economic conditions. This setup provides natural
ground for an event-study identifying how information and communication technologies affect
credit markets.

My results provide a causal evidence of how search frictions affect firm-bank matching and
the allocation of bank credit. First, I find that credit flows between cities follow a gravity
equation that is distorted by the staggered roll-out of Broadband Internet. This technology-
induced reduction in search frictions triggers an average increase by 6% of the share of
credit exchanged between interconnected cities. Consistent with the model’s predictions,
this effect varies dramatically with the initial level of search frictions: it is higher when
two very distant cities are connected. On the contrary, the effect is negative when two
neighbouring cities, already economically very closely tied, are connected by internet. For
robustness, I provide simulation evidence of the performance of the PPML estimator for
the estimation of gravity equations in a dynamic setting and with many zeros, extending
the work of Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006, 2011). I confirm that the Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator with fixed-effects is well behaved and consistently
estimates the time-varying treatment effect, event with more than 90% of zeros. I also show
that my baseline results is barely not affected by the addition city pair fixed-effects and of
the lag dependant variable as covariate.


                                              27


My main results rely on regressions carried out at the urban unit level, which simply matches
the level of the treatment and allows me to deal with an estimation sample of a manageable
size (24 million observations). However, some model predictions at a less aggregated level
require leveraging bank branch-level data. I further document that Broadband Internet
diffusion allows banks to match with new firms located in remote submarkets. Connected
banks increase their share of credit lent to firms located outside their city by 10%, and their
share of remote clients by almost 12%. As a result, the average distance between a bank
and its customers increases by 10% in the medium run after broadband internet access.
These results are robust to several potential threats to identification. I find no evidence of
pre-expansion differential trends in branch-level outcomes and I show that adding city-level
controls do not affect my estimates. Finally, I assess the implications of my findings on the
cost of debt for small firms, through the lens of my model. In practice, I plug my empirical
estimates into the equation linking search frictions to loan prices. Interpreted within my
model, the estimates imply that the reduction in search frictions due to the diffusion of
Broadband Internet lowered the cost of debt for small businesses by 4.9% on average. This
reduction in the cost of debt displays an interesting spatial heterogeneity. It is stronger in
rural areas and medium-sized cities than in the largest french cities. Firms initially located
far from bank branches, or that did not have a wide variety of potential banking contacts,
benefit more from the reduction of search frictions, since it allows them to match with new
or better banking partners. In this respect, the spread of Broadband Internet reduces spatial
inequalities in access to credit.


Chapter 2: Local Bank Specialization
In this chapter, co-authored with Anne Duquerroy, Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier and Daniel
Paravisini, we investigate how differentiation and specialization allow banks to reduce infor-
mation asymmetries and gain market power.

Widespread bank branch closures and consolidation in Europe and the United States after
the Great Recession have renewed a longstanding policy and academic debate about the
nature and implications of bank market power. A vast body of theoretical and empirical
work, following Rajan (1992), has explored one source of such market power: the informa-
tional monopoly gained through relationship lending. Less studied, and of potentially equal
importance, is the market power gained through differentiation and specialization. Lenders
that may appear to compete fiercely in an undifferentiated credit market, may in fact enjoy
market power in some market segments by tailoring their products and services to particular


                                              28


clients, industries, or types of financing. Such credit market segmentation may have first
order implications for the access to credit by small and opaque bank-dependent firms as well
as its cost. Documenting the extent to which banks specialize in a segmented small business
credit market, and assessing whether specialization confers market power, poses important
data and identification challenges that we address in this paper.

We use unique regulatory data that contains, for the universe of bank-firm relationships
in France, the identity and location of the bank branch providing credit. With these data
we construct measures of bank and bank-branch industry specialization in narrowly defined
geographical credit markets. Figure 2.1 provides stylized motivating evidence for our study.
It plots two different measures of credit market concentration by urban unit.2 The left panel
shows the standard concentration measure, calculated using total lending shares. The right
panel shows the average of credit concentrations calculated industry-by-industry, which takes
into account market segmentation. The difference between these two measures will be larger
when the credit market is segmented by industry (e.g., the two measures will be identical if
all bank loan portfolios have the same industry composition). Indeed, the fraction of urban
units with a very high concentration level (HHI > 0.4) raises from from 21% when measured
in the traditional manner, to 49% when measured taking into account credit segmentation
by industry (see Table 2.9 for more details). This pattern is consistent with heavy industry
segmentation in the small business bank credit market.

The main goal of our empirical analysis is to explore the implications of credit market
segmentation for small firms’ access to credit. Our working hypothesis is that a firm’s credit
elasticity of substitution across banks is smaller when specialized banks offer differentiated
services. For example, a firm in the construction industry will find more difficult or costly to
substitute credit obtained from the bank (or branch) that is specialized in the construction
industry than credit obtained from a generalist bank (or branch). A necessary first step is
to evaluate the relevant unit of analysis to study specialization. In other words, do banks
specialize by industry as a whole? Or is specialization a local, branch-level, phenomenon?

To answer this question we follow the data driven approach developed in Paravisini et al.
(2017) to identify banks’ sector of specialization using abnormally large portfolio shares. The
intuition of the measure is best explained through an example. Suppose 20% of bank credit
in an urban area goes to the construction industry and is serviced by five banks. Banks are
heterogeneous: while four banks allocate less than 10% of their loan portfolio to construction,
the fifth bank allocates more than 40% of its credit portfolio to the sector. This fifth bank
   2
    An urban unit is defined as a municipality or a group of municipalities which covers a continuously built
up zone (with no more than 200 meters between two constructions) and hosts at least 2,000 inhabitants.

would be identified as a specialist in the construction industry for this urban area. The
advantage of using portfolio shares to detect specialist banks is that the identification of the
specialization sector is unaffected by the size of the sector or by the market share of each
bank in any given location.

Two key stylized facts emerge from this exercise: bank branches tend to specialize by in-
dustry, but different branches of the same bank generally exhibit different industrial spe-
cializations. More than a third of bank branches in France come out as being specialized
in supplying credit to small firms in at least one specific broad industry. Most urban areas
include specialized bank branches. Moreover, we observe that most industries exhibit special-
ized bank branches at the local level. For instance, some 9% of the bank branches present in
our sample in 2017 are specialized in funding transportation and storage activities. Overall,
this implies that a French SME has a non-negligible probability to get connected to a branch
that is specialized in its type of business. When we investigate specialization patterns of the
branches within banks, we find that large banks are characterized by a large share of spe-
cialized branches (37% for the average bank with more than 10 branches). However, within
a bank, different branches tend to be specialized in different industries. In short, industry
specialization appears in the data as a widespread but local, branch-level, phenomenon.

Motivated by these stylized facts we turn to measuring the heterogeneity in firm’s elasticity
of credit substitution by branch specialization. Our empirical research design exploits bor-
rower reallocations across branches due to branch closures. Among bank branches active in
SME lending, some 700 branches were closed during our sample period (between 2010 and
2017) throughout the country, due to internal restructuring plans of the main banks’ retail
activities. Branch closures did not end bank-borrower relationships: all loan accounts in a
closing branch were transferred to larger nearby branches of the same bank. Branch reallo-
cation induced variation in the match between the borrower’s industry and the industry of
specialization of the branch that we exploit to measure the heterogeneity in the elasticity of
credit substitution. In the construction firm example above, when branch services are seg-
mented by industry, the transfer of the firm’s account to a generalist branch should reduce
the equilibrium amount of credit used by the firm, relative to a counterfactual in which the
account were transferred to another branch that is also specialized in the construction indus-
try. Branch closures occurred in large waves, and the identity of the closing and absorbing
branches were selected by headquarters according to criteria like local bank density, arguably
unrelated to the demand for credit of individual firms. The very disaggregated nature of the
data also allows using saturated specifications to control for local shocks at the urban unit
level, bank shocks, and firm shocks that may occur concurrently with the branch closure.

In the baseline specification we find evidence of a significant drop in the total of credit
granted by a bank to a small firm whenever the firm’s account is reallocated to a new
branch. Including undrawn credit lines, total credit drops by 12% on average over the three
years following the effective closing. Part of this decline is substituted with more credit from
other banks. However, the average firm’s total credit drops permanently by about 4% after
an account reallocation, relative to other firms in the same narrow geographical market and
industry. We then document the heterogeneity of this decline in equilibrium credit by the
match between the borrower’s industry and the industry of specialization of the closing and
absorbing branches. We find that the magnitude of the decline in credit doubles when a
firm’s accounts are reallocated from a branch that specializes in its industry to a branch
that does not. The magnitude of this estimated effect is robust to controlling for the change
in distance associated with the branch closing.

In the cross section, we find that the decline in credit following a branch closure is entirely
explained by the variation in industry specialization between branches when the new branch
is located in an area characterized by a high level of bank competition. The results are
strongly suggestive of a segmented bank credit market, where bank specialization by industry
increases the cost of substituting bank sources of financing for small firms.


Chapter 3: Aggregate Implications of Credit Relation-
ship Flows
In this third chapter, co-authored with Yasser Boualam, we study the implication of market
imperfections in driving credit allocation from a macroeconomic standpoint. What drives
the fluctuations of credit over the business cycle and in the long run? How do banks adjust
their credit supply in response to aggregate shocks or policy changes? These questions
have been at the forefront of macro-finance and banking research at least since the seminal
work of Bernanke (1983). Yet, our understanding of aggregate credit fluctuations and their
implications for the real economy remains incomplete on several fronts.

Bank credit is a significant source of financing for the majority of businesses. One particularly
important aspect that has been extensively studied at the micro level, yet overlooked in
macro, has to do with bank-firm credit relationships. Indeed, a vast theoretical and empirical
literature has long highlighted the role of these relationships in terms of alleviating agency
frictions and shaping credit supply at the lender-borrower level.3 It also emphasized the
  3

existence of cross-sectional heterogeneity in terms of match quality and inherent relationship
characteristics such as duration, which can potentially hinder banks’ ability to adjust their
credit supply in a frictionless way (Boualam (2018)). Conversely, the common view across
most macro-finance models either simply assumes homogeneous borrowers and/or lenders,
or abstracts from the long-term nature of financial contracts and any market frictions that
may prevent banks from costlessly forming or severing these credit matches. These models
thus downplay the value of relationships and their aggregate consequences and imply that
banks can swiftly adjust the number of their borrowers in response to shocks. They also
leave little room for analyzing the process of credit reallocation across bank-firm matches
and its dynamics throughout the cycle.

This paper proposes a novel macro perspective on the process of credit intermediation. It
aims to provide further empirical evidence on the key and distinctive roles played by both the
intensive and extensive margins in shaping aggregate credit fluctuations. Here, we attempt
to look behind such fluctuations in order to address first-order questions such as: (i) When
aggregate bank credit declines by 5%, is it because the average loan size (i.e., intensive
margin) drops by 5%, or is it because 5% of bank-firm matches (i.e., extensive margin) are
destroyed? (ii) Does the origin of aggregate credit fluctuations matter? (iii) Do monetary
policy shocks impact these margins differently?

To our knowledge, we are the first to show that banks actively adjust both the number
and the intensity of their relationships, in response to macroeconomic shocks, and that
both of these margins represent a significant source of variation in bank lending. These
adjustments are somewhat analogous to the ways in which firms constantly adjust both
quantity of hours worked and employment, or their capacity utilization and new capital
investment.4 This view may sound intuitive, yet — and surprisingly — a thorough analysis
of the dynamics of these margins and their macroeconomic implications remains limited, if
not completely absent. Furthermore, we not only establish the quantitative importance of
these margins, but we also argue that they are subject to prominently different aggregate
behaviors. Thus, disentangling the effects associated with each margin can prove informative
about the economic mechanisms at play and the role of credit reallocation, and ultimately
yield relevant policy implications.

To shed light on this process, we leverage a key source of information, the French Credit
Register, which covers the commercial loan market in France, and is maintained by Banque de
   4
     To some extent, our analysis of credit markets follows in the footsteps of Lilien and Hall (1986), who
first decomposed the fluctuations in total hours worked into changes in employment and changes in hours
worked per employed worker.

France. The data contain granular and nearly exhaustive records of bank-firm matches and
corresponding credit exposures over the period 1998-2018. To study the properties of credit
relationship flows, we develop an empirical methodology akin to the one pioneered by Davis
and Haltiwanger (1992) for labor flows. Our methodology takes into consideration specific
characteristics associated with credit market structure and available data. For example, we
track data entries for each bank-firm match to determine the time of creation and inferred
time of destruction in order to construct the associated gross credit relationship flows. We
also account for cross-sectional heterogeneity and the nature of financial contracts through
key attributes such as loan size, credit type and maturity, and relationship duration.

Understanding the implications of bank-firm credit relationships is a natural undertaking.
However, a dearth of empirical evidence documenting their macro-level properties exists
due to the paucity of extensive micro datasets over a sufficiently long period of time. In
fact, earlier studies such as Dell’Ariccia and Garibaldi (2005) relied on bank-level call report
data. Thus, they cannot identify the involved borrowers and can observe net intensive flows
only at the bank level. As a consequence, these studies cannot disentangle extensive from
intensive margins, nor precisely capture the underlying magnitude and properties of credit
reallocation. Instead, we advance here a novel approach to exploit information available in
credit registers, which is typically used in micro settings, to uncover new aggregate findings.
Our research establishes the following stylized facts about the extensive and intensive margins
of credit:

  1. Extensive and intensive margins fluctuate continuously over time. While their persis-
     tence is roughly identical, the volatility of the intensive margin is relatively higher.
  2. Both margins are important at the business cycle frequency, with the extensive margin
     contributing about one quarter to one half of the variance in aggregate credit.
  3. In the long run, the extensive margin accounts for the bulk of aggregate credit varia-
     tions.

Our analysis also highlights the following features pertaining to gross credit relationship
flows:

  1. The creation, destruction, and reallocation of bank-firm relationships coexist through-
     out the cycle.
  2. Creation (inflows) and destruction (outflows) of relationships show greater volatility
     compared to net flows. Variations in net flows are driven mainly by inflows.
  3. Outflows are more volatile for small and short-term loans and credit relationships with
     duration of less than one year. Inflows are more volatile for relationships with small

      loans or lines of credit.

Our results also highlight that credit patterns observed during or in the aftermath of an
economic downturn are driven potentially by multiple combinations of extensive and intensive
margin sources, suggesting that different economic mechanisms may be at play. A better
understanding of the extensive/intensive origin of a credit decline and its bottlenecks can
thus be relevant to the design of effective and targeted policy tools. In this context, we
analyze how monetary policy gets transmitted through both extensive and intensive margin
channels. We show that while the intensive margin responds immediately and strongly to
monetary policy surprises, the extensive margin’s response is relatively more gradual and
subdued during easing regimes. We also note that the extensive margin channel is at play
mainly for relatively small banks or those with flexible balance sheets.

Our empirical framework also provides us with tools to better understand the reallocation
process occurring in credit markets and the channels through which bank shocks get trans-
mitted to the real economy. In particular, we show that the excess reallocation rate of credit
relationships is countercyclical, in line with the cleansing effect of recessions. In addition,
yearly (excess) reallocation rates have been steadily declining over the past two decades.
These results indicate the existence of factors hampering credit market fluidity and contain
relevant theoretical and policy ramifications worthy of further investigation.


Chapter 4: Technology-Induced Trade Shocks ? Evi-
dence from Broadband Expansion in France
In this last chapter, which is joint work with Clément Malgouyres and Thierry Mayer, we
study the role of Broadband Internet in reducing search frictions faced by French importers.

From 1995 to 2008, the value of imports by high-income countries has grown twice as fast as
global GDP.5 This acceleration of globalization has induced well-documented labor market
impacts (Autor et al., 2016b, summarize the recent literature on the impact of the “China
shock” on labor market outcomes), as well as rises in consumer welfare through lower prices
and gains in varieties (see Feenstra and Weinstein, 2017, for a recent illustration). This period
was also characterized by radical innovations in information and communication technologies
(ICT) and by their rapid diffusion throughout the world economy. It is most likely that
the “ICT revolution” (Cohen et al., 2004) lowered the cost of carrying out international
   5
     The World Bank World Development Indicators report that the ratio of imports over GDP for high-
income countries has grown from 43% to 61%.

transactions and contributed to raising the pace of economic integration.6 To the extent that
ICT facilitated international trade, part of the consumer gains induced by trade development
should be attributed to the diffusion of ICTs. In this paper, we test this proposition by
estimating the effect of the diffusion of broadband internet on the importing behavior of
French firms from 1997 to 2007 and by developing a theoretical framework to assess the
impact of broadband-induced imports on consumer welfare.

Identifying the causal effect of technology on trade is generically difficult because of its endo-
geneity. The French data and context allow us to make progress on the causal identification
of how technology affects firm-level import behavior. In terms of data, we assemble a novel
dataset on broadband internet availability at the municipality level over the 1997-2007 pe-
riod and combine it with information regarding firms’ importing behavior. Regarding the
context, we exploit the gradual roll-out of broadband internet in France, which was staggered
over several years due to limited funding and completed primarily in order to maximize pop-
ulation coverage with only limited attention paid to local economic conditions. This setup
provides natural ground for an event-study identifying how ICT availability affected firms’
importing behavior.

We find that the local access to broadband internet leads to a surge in the total value of
firm-level imports. Our point estimate implies a 25% increase after five years. When applied
to our estimating sample and taking into account dynamic effects, the aggregate effect of
broadband expansion on the value of imports in constant dollars over the 1997-2007 period
was to increase its growth rate from 75% to 91%, i.e. 16 p.p. or 21%. Our results are robust
to several potential threats to identification. First, we find no evidence of pre-expansion
differential trends in outcomes. Second, while it is possible that broadband introduction
was systematically associated with contemporaneous local economic shocks, we show that
adding a rich set of city-level controls for local industry and income dynamics hardly affects
our estimates. Additionally, flexibly controlling for changes in local labor market conditions,
by including a large set of local fixed effects interacted with year dummies, barely changes
our estimates.

We further document changes in importing activities along several margins. We find that
the increase in the overall value of imports is primarily associated with an increase in the
number of flows and find no effect on the average value per flow (where a flow is defined
as the combination of an importing firm, an origin country and a specific product). All
types of goods (intermediary, consumption and capital) are affected. We also find that
  6
   Development in ICTs, such as internet and cell phones, has also contributed to unifiying domestic
markets, in particular in developing economies (Allen, 2014).

broadband internet has a positive impact on firm performance as measured by value-added
and sales. Importantly, the import-intensity of firms increases: the ratio of imports over
sales is positively affected as well as the share of foreign inputs in overall consumption of
intermediates.

Our paper focuses on the importing behavior of firms, an outcome that has been relatively
underexplored in comparison to exports (see e.g. Hjort and Poulsen, 2018). This focus is
motivated empirically by the fact that imports have been more dynamic than exports over
the period and conceptually by the notion that imports matter most directly for consumer.
Nevertheless, we present some empirical results on the export side. We find that broadband
stimulated exports albeit to a lower extent than import.

Our main results rely on regressions carried out at the city level. This level of aggregation
matches the level at which we have variation in exposure to treatment and allows us to
capture several margins (intensive margin, extensive margin—firms starting to import—,
entry of new firms) which would be missed by a firm-level panel analysis. Moreover, the
model we use in the last of the paper delivers naturally a city-level estimable equation for
sales and imports. We present firm-level estimates when exploring the heterogeneity of the
effect along a number of dimensions, some of which intrinsically defined at the firm-level
(size, sector etc.).

In the final part of the paper, we assess the welfare implications of our empirical findings
through the lens of a simple but general theoretical model of firm-level imports. We con-
sider a small open economy made of up of several cities. Firms vary idiosyncratically in
terms of productivity across cities and choose the cities that maximize their expected profits
(Suárez Serrato and Zidar, 2016; Fajgelbaum et al., 2019). We use the standard monopo-
listic competition cum CES demand setup for final goods so as to link firm-level sales with
(quality-adjusted) unit cost. On the production side, hinging upon Blaum et al. (2018), firms
combine labor with domestic and imported inputs. Our model features the sufficiency result
highlighted by Blaum et al. (2018): the firm-level domestic share of inputs fully characterizes
the contribution of imports of intermediates to the reduction of its unit cost. The general-
ity of the setup allows us to remain agnostic regarding which type of trade costs (variable,
fixed per destination or product, search friction etc.) is affected by the broadband internet
expansion shock. It also generates a very parsimonious framework for welfare analysis. The
overall effect of access to fast internet on the consumer price index and the contribution
of enhanced access to foreign inputs to that overall effect (which we refer to as the import
channel ) are expressed as a function of two reduced-form estimates and three parameters
to be calibrated (either from descriptive statistics or from the existing relevant literature).

                                              36


Under our preferred values for calibrated parameters, our event-study estimates imply that
broadband internet led to a price index decrease of 1.85%. The import channel contributed
up to 0.75%, i.e. about 40% of the overall effect. We complete this analysis with an extension
that considers the impact of broadband on exports and nominal wages. Results from the
extended welfare analysis indicate that the export channel played a much more limited role
than the import one in driving welfare gains from broadband expansion.

Motivated by empirical evidence I uncover on local credit markets in France, I propose a
theory of firm-bank matching, subject to search frictions. Firms undergo a costly search
process to locate and match with the right banking partner. Upon matching, agency frictions
hinder banks’ ability to optimally screen and monitor projects. Structurally, I estimate my
model on French data using the staggered roll-out of Broadband Internet, from 1997 to 2007,
as a shock to search frictions. I confirm the model predictions that the allocation of credit
was affected by the shock. Finally, I use the structure of my model to quantify the impact of
this technology-induced reduction in search frictions on loan prices. I find that broadband
internet access reduced the cost of debt for small businesses by 4.9%.

undergo a time-consuming application process: over 33 hours are spent on loan request pa-
perwork. Overall, about one third of SMEs deplore a difficult and lengthy credit application
process. While the effect of informational asymmetries on credit allocation has been well
documented (e.g., Akerlof, 1970; Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981; Petersen and Rajan, 1995), little

is known about how search frictions affect bank-firm matching and access to credit. Un-
derstanding the role of search frictions is particularly important to policy makers, not only
as recent developments in information technology and digitisation in the banking industry
are likely to affect search frictions, but also as policies that reduce search costs may differ
substantially from policies that reduce traditional agency frictions.

The first contribution of the paper is to develop a theory of firm-bank matching subject to
informational frictions. This theory is motivated by new stylized facts I uncover on local
credit markets in France: I use a unique data set on small business lending from 1998 to
2005 to document several patterns in the observed loan prices, bank branches heterogeneity
and credit flows across cities that suggest, along with survey evidence, the presence of search
frictions in credit markets. I then develop a partial equilibrium model of firm-bank matching
that is able to capture and explain the observed patterns in the data.1 The model features
two-sided heterogeneity – bank branches and firms – and information frictions of two kinds.
First, search frictions hinder firms’ ability to locate and match with the right financing
partner. Second and upon matching, informational asymmetries affect banks’ ability to
screen and monitor projects. By adding structure to the search and matching process, I
generate a number of theoretical predictions linking the level of search frictions to (i) the
cost of debt for small businesses, (ii) credit flows between cities and (iii) the dynamic of firm-
bank matching. In particular, when search costs decrease, firms meet with more potential
lenders and eventually borrow credit at a lower rate.

The second contribution of the paper is to take the model to the data. I structurally test the
main predictions of my model using the staggered diffusion of Broadband Internet (BI) in
France, from 1999 to 2007, as a shock on search frictions. I then use my empirical estimates
to quantify a technology-induced reduction in the cost of debt for French SMEs, along the
lines of my model. The large diffusion of information and communication technologies has
indeed represented a profound change for the banking industry and Broadband Internet was
the catalyst for this numerical transformation. As digitization proceeded apace, transaction
costs decreased and the rise of online financial services allowed firms to search for the best
banking partner in a faster and more efficient way, leading to structural changes in banking
markets (Hauswald and Marquez, 2003). Kroszner and Strahan (1999) showed how the large-
scale adoption of information technology reduced the dependence on geographical proximity
between customers and banks, and Petersen and Rajan (2002) documented the erosion of
the local nature of small business lending, with increasing distance between small firms
  1
      From a modeling standpoint, my approach is in the spirit of Eaton et al. (2018) and Lenoir et al. (2018).

and their lenders in the United States and new communication habits. Similar trends are
observed in France: inter-regional credit flows have grown by 15% and the average firm-bank
distance has increased by 10% between 1998 and 2005. My empirical approach provide a
causal interpretation for those facts, suggesting that innovations in information technology –
namely, Broadband Internet diffusion – have reduced the role of both transaction and search
costs in shaping credit outcomes, allowing firms to search for credit further and leading to
structural changes in local credit markets.

Identifying the causal effect of new technology adoption on firm-bank matching and credit
outcomes is difficult because of its endogeneity. The French data and context allow me to
make progress on the causal identification of how technology affects search frictions in credit
markets and, in turn, firm-bank matching and credit flows. The third contribution of the
paper is that I propose a novel instrumental variable strategy for the timing of Broadband
Internet expansion, that is based on a theoretical optimal investment plan for infrastructure
upgrading. I use a dataset on Broadband Internet availability at the municipality level
over the 1999-2007 period compiled by Malgouyres (2017) and combine it with information
regarding population density and existing telecommunication infrastructures, namely local
copper loops networks and large fiber optic cables. Because Broadband Internet operators
relied on these already existing infrastructures to gradually deploy Broadband, I show that
the optimal timing of Broadband availability can be predicted using this data, without
additional information regarding local economic conditions. This setup provides natural
ground for an event-study identifying how information and communication technologies affect
credit markets.

My results provide causal evidence of how search frictions affect firm-bank matching and
the allocation of bank credit. First, I find that credit flows between cities follow a gravity
equation that is distorted by the staggered roll-out of Broadband Internet. This technology-
induced reduction in search frictions triggers an average increase by 6% of the share of
credit exchanged between interconnected cities. Consistent with the model’s predictions,
this effect varies dramatically with the initial level of search frictions: it is higher when
two very distant cities are connected. On the contrary, the effect is negative when two
neighbouring cities, already economically very closely tied, are connected by internet. For
robustness, I provide simulation evidence of the performance of the PPML estimator for
the estimation of gravity equations in a dynamic setting and with many zeros, extending
the work of Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006, 2011). I confirm that the Poisson pseudo-
maximum likelihood (PPML) estimator with fixed-effects is well behaved and consistently


                                              45


estimates the time-varying treatment effect, even with more than 90% of zeros. I also show
that my baseline results are barely affected by the addition city pair fixed-effects and of the
lag dependent variable as covariate.

My main results rely on regressions carried out at the urban unit level, which simply matches
the level of the treatment and allows me to deal with an estimation sample of a manageable
size (24 million observations). However, some model predictions at a less aggregated level
require leveraging bank branch-level data. I further document that Broadband Internet
diffusion allows banks to match with new firms located in remote submarkets. Connected
banks increase their share of credit lent to firms located outside their city by 10%, and their
share of remote clients by almost 12%. As a result, the average distance between a bank
and its customers increases by 10% in the medium term after broadband internet access.
These results are robust to several potential threats to identification. I find no evidence of
pre-expansion differential trends in branch-level outcomes and I show that adding city-level
controls do not affect my estimates.

Finally, I assess the implications of my findings on the cost of debt for small firms, through
the lens of my model. In practice, I plug my empirical estimates into the equation linking
search frictions to loan prices. Interpreted within my model, the estimates imply that the
reduction in search frictions due to the diffusion of Broadband Internet lowered the cost of
debt for small businesses by 4.9% on average. This reduction in the cost of debt displays an
interesting spatial heterogeneity. It is stronger in rural areas and medium-sized cities than
in the largest French cities. Firms initially located far from bank branches, or which did
not have a wide variety of potential banking contacts, benefited more from the reduction of
search frictions, since it allows them to match with new or better banking partners. In this
respect, the spread of Broadband Internet reduces spatial inequalities in access to credit.

search and matching.

There is a vast theoretical and empirical literature in corporate finance and microeconomics
on the role that informational frictions plays in hampering firms’ access to credit, starting
with seminal papers by Akerlof (1970) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981).2 This literature has
long highlighted the role of bank-firm relationships in alleviating agency frictions and shaping

credit supply (for surveys see, e.g., Boot, 2000; Degryse et al., 2009; Udell, 2015). Yet, the
role of search frictions, in particular in the formation of bank-firm relationships, has been
overlooked despite its potentially equal importance.3 I propose a novel theory of firm-bank
matching and SME access to credit that formally introduces search and contracting frictions.
I first provide empirical evidence that emphasizes the importance of search and transaction
costs in local credit markets. Then, I write a partial equilibrium model of firm-bank matching
subject to both search and agency frictions that I structurally take to the data.4 As far as
I know, this paper is the first one to account for search frictions in the formation of bank-
firm relationships from a micro perspective and provide causal evidence of how a reduction
in search frictions affects the allocation of credit.5 This contribution has important policy
implications, as an environment characterized by search frictions may not only amplify and
propagate shocks (den Haan et al., 2003; Wasmer and Weil, 2004) but also generate slow
recoveries (Boualam, 2018).

This paper is also directly related to the literature that explores the determinants of bank-
firm matching. Firm and bank size appear as key characteristics (Stein, 2002; Hubbard
et al., 2002; Cole et al., 2004; Berger et al., 2005), along with geographic proximity (Petersen
and Rajan, 1995, 2002), export country specialization (Paravisini et al., 2015), monitoring
capacity (Jing, 2014) and bank capitalization (Schwert, 2018). However, little evidence exists
on the importance of branch characteristics, despite the fact that bank branches and loan
officers are the main contact point for SMEs searching for the right banking partner (Berger
et al., 1997). I contribute to this literature by leveraging bank branch-level data. I show
that branch characteristics (size, distance to client, growth, specialization) matter for the
matching with small firms. I use this empirical evidence as a motivation for my theoretical
framework, where bank branches are heterogeneous in size and distance to clients.

     Recently Boualam (2018), that builds a general equilibrium theory of bank lending relationships in an
economy subject to search frictions and limited enforceability, in a related macro approach. The interaction
between search and agency frictions generates a slow accumulation of lending relationship capital, distorts
the optimal allocation of credit and leads to slow recoveries. While its approach features a directed search
process, I model search as random. Not only this is for tractability purpose, but it is also consistent with the
fact that entrepreneurs – who can’t devote much time and ressources to this costly search – don’t observe
bank branches and loan officers characteristics before meeting with them.

equity flows (Portes and Rey, 2005), bonds and bank holdings (Coeurdacier and Martin,
2009) and cross-border asset holdings (Okawa and van Wincoop, 2012). Recently, Brei
and von Peter (2018) estimated gravity equations on international banking flows using a
PPML approach. They find a substantial role of distance for banking, even with immaterial
transport cost, pointing to the role of information frictions. My paper complements and
extends these findings by estimating a gravity equation for within-country bank credit flows
with two types of informational asymmetries. It confirms the prominent role of distance,
even for local credit markets, but also underlines the relevance of search frictions.

This paper also relates to the vast literature in labor (see for a survey, e.g., Rogerson et al.,
2005) and trade (Rauch, 2001; Chaney, 2014; Allen, 2014; Lenoir et al., 2018) that studies
how search and matching frictions affect firms’ ability to produce. This literature has long
highlighted that it takes time and resources for a worker to land a job, for a firm to fill a
vacancy, for an exporter to find customers abroad or, symmetrically, for an importer to match
with the right supplier remotely. I contribute to this literature by showing that search and
matching frictions also affect firms’ ability to raise external finance. While the theoretical
approach developed herein is in the spirit of trade models (Eaton et al., 2018; Lenoir et al.,
2018) where firms undergo a random search process, it incorporates agency frictions that
replace traditional iceberg transport costs. Finally, some recent papers explore how the
diffusion of information and communication technologies – including Broadband Internet –
affect such frictions (Allen, 2014; Lendle et al., 2016; Steinwender, 2018; Akerman et al., 2018;
Magouyres et al., 2019; Bhuller et al., 2019). My contribution to this literature is twofold.
First, I structurally estimate the impact of a technology-induced reduction in search frictions
on credit markets and credit search. I provide a causal interpretation of recent structural
changes observed in banking markets (Kroszner and Strahan, 1999; Petersen and Rajan,
2002) such as the erosion of the dependence on geographical proximity between customers
and banks and the change in competition, eroding banks’ rents, in line with Hauswald and
Marquez (2003). Second, I develop a novel IV for the timing of Broadband Internet diffusion.
As the observed pace of expansion of Broadband Internet may be endogenous, I show how
to generate a connection timing that only depends on such ex-ante city-level characteristics
as population density and distance to infrastructure.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 presents the data. Section 2 doc-
uments new stylized facts on local credit markets in France that set the ground and serve
as foundation for our theoretical framework. Section 3 presents the model and its main
predictions that will guide the empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the empirical context

Section 6 details the results. Finally, Section 7 studies the implications for the cost of debt
through the lens of my model. Section 8 concludes.


1.     Data
In this section, I provide a brief description of the data I use to study local credit markets
in France and how they were affected by Broadband Internet diffusion over the period 1998-
2005. I combine multiple proprietary data sets from the Banque de France about firm-bank
relationships, branch-level credit exposure, interest rates of new loans, with unique data on
Broadband Internet expansion at the city-level.


1.1.   The Credit Register
The French Credit Register is a large data set of bank-firm linkages available at the Bank of
France over the period 1998-2005. This credit register aims to collect data on bank exposures
to residents on a monthly basis to monitor and control systemic risk. The monthly data comes
from reports by credit institutions that are mandatory provided that their commitments
or risk exposures on a company as defined by a legal unit and referenced by a national
identification number (SIREN), reach a total of EUR 75,000. I use a yearly version of
the credit register for convenience as I already deal with an oversized dataset. Monthly
reports encompass the funds made available or drawn credits, the bank’s commitments on
credit lines and guarantee as well as medium and long-term leasing, factoring and securitized
loans at the branch level. Recipients are single businesses, corporations, sole-proprietorship
engaged in professional activities. They may be registered in France or abroad. Reporting
financial intermediaries include all resident credit institutions, investment firms, and other
public institutions. In 2005, this raw data set excluding individual entrepreneurs covers
information on more than 1.9 millions of bank-firms relationships, corresponding to more
than 1.4 million of unique firms or corporations (SIREN), 341 unique banks and 15,925
bank branches serving firms. The smallest banks in my sample own only one branch. In
contrast, the largest one (i.e. Crédit Lyonnais) owns more than 2,800 branches all across the
country.


1.2.   Loan Rates (M-Contran)
The M-Contran database gathers quarterly survey about all new loans granted to French
firms from 2006 Q1 to 2016 Q4. This information is collected by the Banque de France in

                                              49


order to compute quarterly aggregate statistics on the interest rates of new loan contracts,
with breakdowns by types of loans, borrowing sectors and types of credit institution. It also
enables Banque de France to estimate and publish usury interest rates, an upward limit on
lending rates set by French law. All main credit institutions report exhaustive information for
all new individual loans from their reporting branches granted during the first month of each
quarter. The initial dataset reports, on average, about 100,000 new loans in each quarter.
In addition to interest rates,the survey provides rich information on a wide range of relevant
loans characteristics, such as the size of the loan, the loan’s precise purpose (investment,
treasury, leasing etc.), its maturity at issuance, whether it is fixed-rate or adjustable rate,
and whether it is secured or not.


1.3.   Firm Location, Creation and Geography
Firm Location and Creation. In order to conduct different empirical exercises along this
paper, I gather a rich set of (i) administrative data on the creation date and the location
French firms’ establishments (from the exhaustive SIRENE database). Firms’ establishment
locations allow me to identify mono-establishment or mono-city firms (which is a key feature
of my identification strategy), the year of creation is useful to study firm entry and first
banking partner choice in section 2.2.

Geographical data. I gather geographical data for mainland France about more than
36.000 municipalities, 2,000 urban units and 762 urban areas. An urban unit (UU) is a
commune or group of communes that includes on its territory a built-up area of at least
2,000 inhabitants where no dwelling is separated from the nearest one by more than 200
meters. In addition, each municipality concerned has more than half of its population in this
built-up area. The largest geographical unit that we consider in this paper is the urban area
(UA). An urban area is defined as a group of municipalities, all in one piece and without
enclaves, consisting of an urban pole with more than 10,000 jobs, and rural municipalities
or urban units where at least 40% of the resident population with a job works in the pole
or in municipalities attracted by it. Finally, municipalities or cities are the finest unit of
measurement that I use for distance computation, firm and branch locations. For most of
my empirical analysis, I aggregate bank branches credit exposure, distance to clients, etc.,
at the urban unit level. I then use urban unit or city to refer to this geographical unit.

1.4.       Broadband Internet Data
I use the unique data collected by Magouyres et al. (2019) about the date of upgrade to
ADSL for each Local Exchange (LE)’s in mainland France. The historical operator (France
Télécom) had to make this data available to other operators as well as websites allowing
consumers to gauge the quality of their line for regulatory reasons. Additionally, the authors
gather data from the regulatory agency (ARCEP) regarding the geographical coverage of each
LE. Combining both datasets, Magouyres et al. (2019) construct a continuous measure6 of
broadband access of city i at year t, denoted Zitcity-level , which is a time-weighted percentage
of area covered in city i. I construct a additional continuous measure of connectivity at the
                    urban-unit
urban-unit level, Zut          which is simply the (weighted) sum of Zitcity-level for each i ∈ u:
                                                        X
                                         urban-unit

                                                        i∈u



where i ∈ u denotes the municipalities included in urban unit u and wi is the weight of city
                                                                        urban-unit
i in the total population of urban unit u. Equation 1.2 implies that Zut           is continuous
between 0 and 1. Namely, 0 implies that no firm located in u enjoy an ADSL connection
during year t, while 1 indicates that all firms benefit from it all the year long. Figure 1.5
shows the roll-out of Broadband Internet for all urban-units in mainland France, from 1998
to 2005. The dark areas represent a large degree of coverage (a high Zut ).


                                       [FIGURE 1.5 ABOUT HERE]


In 2000, those are confined to the few major cities of France, surrounded by a large majority of
no-ADSL territories. By 2003, the treatment has largely spread to lower scale-municipalities,
although large parts of France remain dependent on the old technology.

       Formally, the measure used by Magouyres et al. (2019) writes:

Zeit will be equal to one if all of its areas have had access for the entire year. It will be equal to 1/2 if the
entire city has had access to broadband over half the year t.

2.        Search Frictions in Credit Markets
In this section, I present a body of novel facts about French credit markets that suggest
the presence of search frictions: I first document bank branch heterogeneity and endogenous
firm-branch matching; then, I describe the geography of credit flows and I provide evidence of
substantial price dispersion; Finally, I mirror those empirical facts with new survey evidence.


2.1.       Bank Branch Heterogeneity
In a highly competitive and decentralized banking sector, large national banks compete lo-
cally through their branch networks, across multiple geographic submarkets. Local bank
branches and loan officers are therefore the main contact point for entrepreneurs searching
for the right banking partner and branch offices characteristics appear as critical factors
to firms, especially SMEs, when choosing their financial services providers (Berger et al.,
1997). While prior literature shows that the matching of firms and banks is endogeneous
and depends on firm and bank size (Stein, 2002; Hubbard et al., 2002; Cole et al., 2004;
Berger et al., 2005), geographic proximity (Petersen and Rajan, 1995, 2002), export country
specialization (Paravisini et al., 2015), monitoring capacity (Jing, 2014) and bank capital-
ization (Schwert, 2018), little evidence exists on the importance of branch characteristics. In
this section, I focus on bank branches – rather than bank – heterogeneity. I document four
important facts. Branches differ markedly from each others with respect to (i) their total
credit exposure, (ii) their average distance to clients (iii) the number of markets in which
they operate and (iv) their portfolio specialization.


Branch Size. Figure 1.6 and 1.7 display the distribution of branch size for the last quarter
of 2005. I compute the size of a branch as its total credit exposure (1.6) and, alternatively,
its number of clients (1.7). Then, I rank branches by size7 : #1 being the largest branch, #2
the second largest, and so on; finally, I plot the log (Size) versus the log (Rank).


                                 [FIGURES 1.6 AND 1.7 ABOUT HERE]
   7
       Regressing the log rank on log size, I find the following:

                                       log (Rank) = 12.29 -1.04 · log (Size)
                                                              [0.002]

The relationship is close to a straight line (R2=0.95), and the slope is very close to 1 (the standard deviation
of the estimated slope is 0.02). This means that the rank of a bank branch is essentially proportional to the
inverse of its size. A slope of approximately 1 has been found repeatedly using data on city and firm size,
stock markets returns, etc. (Gabaix, 2016)


                                                         52


The relationship between log size and log rank is close to a straight line and the slope is
very close to 1. This indicates that the distribution of branch size follows a power law (i.e.
Pareto distribution): a few number of very large branches grant credit to many firms ( ≥
10.000 clients) while a vast majority of small offices only finance 10 to 20 clients.


Branch-Firm Distance. Figure 1.8 shows the positive correlation between branch size
(measured as total credit exposure and, alternatively, as the number of clients) and average
square geographic distance between the branch and its clients, in kilometers, for the last
quarter of 2005.


                               [FIGURE 1.8 ABOUT HERE]


The average squared distance from a branch to its clients is a power function of the branch
size: the bigger the branch the larger the geographic distance is. Bank branches differ in
their role and their ability to finance remote clients. Smaller branches focus on their very
local market and concentrate on proximity lending: example (branches with less than 10
clients are in average 15.5 km from them). On the contrary, largest branches grant credit to
firms located in other cities or regions (branches with more than 100 clients (top 1%) are, in
average, 80 km from them). This heterogeneity may be the result of banks internal organiza-
tion and simply reflects the hierarchy between local branch offices and large business centers.
This may also be driven by branch productivity (larger branches being able to screen and
monitor more efficiently remote clients), specialization or local economic conditions, but this
question remains beyond the scope of this article.


Branch Size and Market Entry. How does a bank branch ability to finance distant
clients relate to its local activity? I rank and group bank branches based on the number of
remote submarkets (i.e. urban units) where they operate: all my branches lend at least to
one submarket while none are active in all. Figure 1.9 depicts average credit size in branch
local submarket (”at home”) for the group of branches that operate at least in k remote
submarkets, with k on the x axis.


                               [FIGURE 1.9 ABOUT HERE]


The relationship between the average credit exposure in the branch local submarket and the
number of remote submarkets penetrated is strongly positive and corroborates the findings


                                              53


of 1.8. The larger a branch is locally, the higher the number of distant submarkets served.
This striking regularity reveal another facet of the bank branch heterogeneity that relates
first to the likelihood, for a firm, of meeting with a bank branch located outside its local
submarket and, second, to the ability of a loan officer to remotely screen and monitor this
firm.


Bank Branch Specialization. Using similar data and methodology than Duquerroy et al.
(2019), I show that, within a bank and a urban unit, branches specialize in several dimen-
sions: industry, type of loans and type of businesses. In particular, some bank branches
appear to finance heavily SMEs in comparison with other branches located in a same sub-
market and belonging to a same banking network. I define a branch to be specialized in an
industry (respectively, size category) if its portfolio share of lending to firms in an industry
(respectively, a size category) is a right-tail outlier in the distribution of portfolio shares of
lending by all branches within the same urban unit.


2.2.   Endogenous Firm-Branch Matching
In section 2.1, I documented the fact that bank branches markedly differ from each oth-
ers in several dimensions. Thus, search frictions may arise if firms pay attention to those
branch characteristics and devote time and ressources to locate and match with the ideal
interlocutor. Does this observed heterogeneity affect how firms search for the right banking
partner ? Does it lead to endogenous matching ? To address those questions, I investigate
the importance of branch characteristics in new firms matching decisions.


Data Sources. I use a new dataset of firm creations from 2002 to 2005 for mono-establishment
firms that I combine with information from the Credit Register about firms first realized
banking match. The number of firm creations in my sample ranges from 9,958 in 2002 to
14,178 in 2005. After their establishment, firms match with a single bank branch: the period
of time running from firm entry to firm first banking match is two years on average. How-
ever, more than 50% of those new firms find their banking partner within their first year of
existence. For the sake of simplicity, I keep in my final sample firms that match with their
first banking partner in less than 5 years, which represent 90% of the observations: I end
up with 45,685 new firms entering 711 distinct submarkets and matching with 12,952 bank
branches. For each of those new firms, I build the universe of possible banking partners,
which I define as all the existing branches located in the same urban area that are active the
year of entry. Over all possible pairs, I observe only a single realized match.

Regression Specification. I present reduced-form evidence of endogenous firm-branch
matching: a new firm i, when entering a local credit submarket, is more likely to match with
a bank branch j that ex-ante shares some common specialisation and size characteristics
with the firm. In particular, conditional on distance, a newly created SME from sector s is
more likely to borrow from a branch that specializes in lending to small firms or to firms
belonging to the sector s. Additionally, I find that larger and growing branches appear
to easily attract and match with new clients. Formally, I estimate a Probit regression of
different specifications of the following equation :
                                            
           P( Matchi,j,t | observables ) = Φ α · Distancei,j

                                        + β3 · Spec. Sectorj,t−1 + β4 · Spec. Sizej,t−1

where Φ is the c.d.f. of the standard normal distribution; Spec. Sectorj,t−1 (respectively
Spec. Sizej,t−1 ) takes the value 1 if branch j is specialized in lending to firms from the same
sector (respectively same size) as firm i, the year before firm i entry. Sizej,t−1 is the log size
of branch j, measured as total credit exposure and, alternatively, as the number of clients
and Size Growthj,t−1 is the growth rate of branch j, both measured the year before firm i
entry. Distancei,j is simply the log geodesic distance in kilometers between branch j and firm
i. All explanatory variables are lagged so the branch j characteristics are measured before
firm i entry and are not contaminated by the realized firm-branch matching. The dependent
variable is an indicator function that takes the value 1 if firm i is borrowing from branch j
at t.


Coefficients Interpretation. The coefficient α controls for the direct impact of proximity
on the likelihood of firm-branch matching: physical proximity is likely to alleviate informa-
tional frictions affecting banks’ screening and monitoring costs (see Agarwal and Hauswald,
2010) as being close to clients eases the acquisition and the use of private information in
informationally opaque credit markets.

Coefficients β1 and β2 control for heterogeneity in size and dynamics of bank branches docu-
mented in section 2.1. β1 > 0 and β2 > 0 would suggest that large and fast-growing branches
are likely to be more efficient or visible and, conditional on distance, to offer better contract
terms. Finally, coefficients β3 and β4 control for the direct impact of branch specialization
(industry or size category) on firm’s choice of banking partner: this relates to Paravisini

β4 > 0) would mean that a given firm i is more likely to match with a bank branch j that
has developed ex-ante a specific advantage in lending to firm’ i industry (alternatively, the

Results. Table 1.1 shows the marginal effects from the Probit estimation of different spec-
ifications of equation (1.3). Standard errors are clustered at the urban unit level. In every
specification, all coefficients are statistically significant (at the 1 percent confidence level),
and of the expected signs. Both physical proximity (α), branch size (β1 ) and branch growth
(β2 ) increase the likelihood that a firm match with a bank branch. More interestingly, the
actual existing portfolio of a branch shapes its future matches: a branch that specializes in
lending to industry a is more likely to be chosen by a firm from industry a when it enters
the credit market. To conclude, I find reduced-form evidence that bank branch heterogene-
ity does matter for small firms financing decisions; SMEs are more likely to search for and
then match with branches that ex-ante exhibit a high-level of complementarity, which could

suggest the presence of search costs if firms devote time and ressources to gather information
about potential banking partners before applying for a loan.


2.3.    The Geography of Bank Credit
I describe the geography of credit flows and document new facts consistent with the presence
of search frictions. In a frictionless world, meeting with many bankers is not costly and firms
always benefit from borrowing from neighbouring banks 8 , if possible, and inter-urban unit
lending should be marginal. In particular, if a branch and a firm located in the same urban
unit are simultaneously offering and applying for credit, a match is likely to occur locally.
Therefore, we shoudn’t observe a branch and a firm, while being located in the same urban
unit, simultaneously lending and borrowing from another distant urban unit.

Simultaneous inter-submarket lending. In order to verify this assumption, I construct
credit flows between each pair of urban units, using data from the French Credit Register
between 1998 and 2005. Credit flows from i to j are defined as the total credit granted by
all bank branches located in i to remote firms located in j : urban units may be lenders,
borrowers or both. Table 1.10 presents the results.


                                    [FIGURE 1.10 ABOUT HERE]


The first bar (in blue) indicates that more than 70 % of urban units borrow and lend si-
multaneously to remote submarkets. One could think of it as being the result of regional
specialization. A firm located in a urban unit where branches are not able to offer a very
specific type of credit, or to lend to a specific industry / firm size, may be forced to search
for creditors elsewhere. Yet, the other blue bars indicates that a vast majority of urban
units borrow and lend simultaneously the same type of credit to remote submarket: SMEs
in urban unit a borrow long-term credit (LT) to branches in urban unit b, while branches in
urban unit a simultaneously lend LT credit to SMEs in urban unit c.

Simultaneous two-way lending. More interestingly, I show that two-way lending occurs.
Red bars on figure 1.10 indicate that more than 60 % of urban units simultaneously borrow
   8
    A large body of work has highlighted the importance of geographical distance on firm-bank relationship,
especially for small firms (Petersen and Rajan (1995), Hauswald and Marquez (2006)). Degryse and Ongena
(2005) show that lenders located in the vicinity of small firms face significantly lower transportation and
monitoring costs: Banks derive market power ex ante from their relative physical proximity to the borrowing
firms or ex post from private information they obtain about firms during the course of the lending relationship.
Consequently, most of the lending activity should concentrate within a city or an urban unit, between a firm
and a branch in close proximity to each other.

and lend to the same distant submarket. Some bank branches located in Paris finance firms
in Bordeaux, while some bank branches in Bordeaux finance firms in Paris. This fact is
robust when I control for the type of credit and the type of firm (red bars 2 to 6).


2.4.   Price Dispersion
Finally, inspired by the labor market literature, I document the fact that the law of one price
does not hold in French credit submarkets. Using rich quarterly micro data on new loans
to SMEs from the Sirius/M-Contran database, I show that credit rates exhibit a substan-
tial dispersion within a time-bank branch-industry-department quadruplet, consistent with
recent evidence on mortgage and consumer credit markets (see Argyle et al., 2019; Allen
et al., 2019). Note that controlling for loans and borrowers characteristics does not affect
my result. Formally, I estimate equation (1.4) that aims to explain the observed variation
in loan prices:

             Interest rateijtu = Loanijtu · ρ1 + Firmijtu · ρ2
                                              + FEs(u) + FEj + FEt + FEu + ijtu           (1.4)

where i stands for the borrower, j for the bank branch, t for the quarter and u indicates the
urban area in which both the firm and the bank branch operate. Loanijtu is a vector of loan
characteristics (term in months, amount, type of rate: fixed or variable), Firmijtu is a vector
of firm i characteristics (age, size, debt, investment grade, turnover). I sequentially add a
bank (alternatively, a branch) fixed-effect, county fixed effect (i.e. French ”Departments”),
a sector (NACE Rev. 2 French classification) fixed-effect and a quarter fixed-effect. Table
1.2 shows the R2 of an OLS regression for different specifications of equation (1.4) and for
three categories of credit: equipment loans, credit lines and leasing.

As I am mostly interested in the explanatory power of these different groups of observable
variables and fixed-effects, I only report the R2 of each regression. The results indicate that,
at best, the model accounts for 70% of the observed variance in credit prices, letting more
than 30% (40% for leasing) of the variance unexplained, even when the model is saturated.
Similarly, Cerqueiro et al. (2011) find substantial dispersion in loan rates for seemingly
identical borrowers, using confidential Belgian data. The authors attribute this dispersion
to information imperfections and asymmetries affecting credit markets and, among them,
search costs. Note that if my reported R2 is somehow larger than Cerqueiro et al. (2011)
findings, this is due to the very strict inclusion of fixed-effects, notably bank branch FE, in
my empirical model.

and a quarter fixed-effect.



2.5.       Survey Evidence
In this section, I document a series of evidence of search frictions from recent surveys that
are consistent with empirical findings presented above. First, industry reports show that
locating the right banking partner is not straightforward and that firms commonly multiply
loan applications: the FED (2014) survey indicates that 3 applications are submitted on
average (2.7 institutions contacted). Second, surveys highlight the fact that the application
process for a loan is time-consuming: 33 hours are spent applying for credit on average ac-
cording to the FED (2014) report, consistent to Infosys (2018) survey: SMEs spend over 25
hours – simply on their loan request paperwork – and have to approach numerous banks with
their application. Among the SMEs, 26% (29%) deplore a difficult application process with
large (small) banks.


Additionally, surveys highlight important transaction delays. Industry reports show delays
in the range of 45-90 days between the application and the closing date. The Infosys (2018)
survey indicates that 24% (29%) of SMEs report a long wait for the credit decision or
funding with large banks (small banks), namely high underwriting, transaction and search
costs. The OECD (2018) report ”Enhancing SME access to diversified financing instruments”
corroborates this conclusion: transaction costs are particularly high in relative terms for
micro-entreprises, start-ups, young SMEs. This costly search, among other factors, may
result in firm resignation: 37% of businesses appear to give up their search for finance and
cancel their spending plans after their first rejection (BIS/BMG Research, 2018).

3.      Model
Motivated by empirical evidence I document on search frictions in French credit markets,
I present a partial equilibrium model of firm-bank matching and inter-regional credit flows
based on Eaton and Kortum (2002), that incorporates realistic geographic aspects. The
model features two-sided heterogeneity – bank branches and firms – and information frictions
of two kinds; First, informational asymmetries affect banks ability to screen and monitor
projects. Second, search frictions hinder firms ability to locate and match with the right
financing partner, as in Eaton et al. (2018) and Lenoir et al. (2018).9 The model captures
the key empirical evidence presented in section 2. In the following sections, I start by
summarizing the main assumptions; Then, I derive analytical predictions on aggregate credit
flows and firm-bank matching.


3.1.    Setup
There are a large number of local submarkets in the economy, indexed by u = 1,...,N ,
each inhabited by an exogenous mass of entrepreneurs (SMEs) and bank branches. In what
follows, I use u to refer to the submarket in which a bank branch is located (the origin
submarket) and v to refer to the submarket in which the branch customer is located (the
destination submarket) . In this economy, a single good is consumed by entrepreneurs and
provided by bank branches into perfectly substitute varieties: bank credit.


Supply side. There is a continuum of bank branches in each submarket u, of measure
             −θ
Nu = Su · zmin  , with Su indicates the size of the submarket. Bank branches produce and
provide credit with a single factor constant return-to-scale production function10 . For the
sake of simplicity, I make no distinction between short-term and long-term loans and I do
not model more complex credit types as leasing or factoring. Bank branches operating in
submarket u incur an exogenous input unit cost cu , that encompasses the branch office rent,
loan officer wage or marketing expenses, among others. The productivity of a bank branch
bu located in submarket u is independently drawn from a Pareto distribution of parameter
   9
     This model is inspired by the recent trade literature that emphasise the role of search frictions in
international goods market. Here, I model bank credit as a special kind of good that require buyer-supplier
search and matching and involve no traditional transportation cost.
  10
     Constant return-to-scale technology for bank branches seems to be a reasonable assumption as it has been
documented for large financial institutions (McAllister and McManus, 1993); However, increasing return-to-
scale appears to better fit the data for most US banks, a fact further documented in Wheelock and Wilson
(2012). Using increasing rather than constant return-to-scale does not affect the predictions of the model.

Note that this Pareto assumption is data driven (see section 2.1): branch size – measured as
its total credit exposure – is used as a proxy of branch productivity, which I can’t measure
accurately. Thus, the number of bank branches located in submarket u that can provide
credit with efficiency above z writes Nu (z) = Su · z −θ .


Bank branches located in u additionally incur a variable cost duv when lending to a firm
located in a remote submarket v, which is a function of the physical distance between sub-
markets u and v. This iceberg cost encompasses the fact that branches located closer to
borrowing firms enjoy significantly lower i) transportation, ii) screening and iii) monitoring
costs (Degryse and Ongena, 2005). In line with theoretical location models (Hotelling, 1929;
Salop, 1979) that include distance-related transportation costs, transportation and monitor-
ing costs increase with borrower-lender distance because of additional communication costs
and time-consuming transport for the loan officer when visiting its remote clients. Screen-
ing costs, stemming directly from asymmetric information (Hauswald and Marquez, 2003),
also decrease with firm-branch distance, such as the precision of the signal about borrower’s
quality. Thus, bank branches market power arises from this proximity to local borrowers
and erodes over distance.


Demand side. Each submarket u is populated with a continuum of ex-ante heterogeneous
entrepreneurs (or SMEs) with an investment project I, of size normalized to one, and no
cash. Entrepreneurs differ in their productivity ze . The productivity of an entrepreneur eu
located in submarket u, is independently drawn from a Pareto distribution of parameter γ

such as the number of firms in a submarket writes Fu = Su · zmin           . In order to start
their investment project, entrepreneurs need to raise external finance from banks – which
is the only source of external finance available for small firms. Because of search frictions,
it is difficult to locate the right banking partner; as a consequence, an entrepreneur has to
undergo costly search process.

    I remain agnostic about the entrepreneur production function that can be either Cobb-Douglas or CES,
without altering the model predictions.

Search and matching. I build on Eaton et al. (2018) where matching between buyers
and sellers is random. Each entrepreneur meet with a discrete number of bank branches,
some located in their own submarket, some located remotely. This random search process
is a reduce form for the active search for banking partners: entrepreneurs need to gather
information about bank branches characteristics, contact loan officers and, finally, physically
meet with them to get a price quote.

Formally, the discrete number of branches met in submarket u is drawn into the distribution
              −θ
Nu = Su · zmin   . This implies that the number of branches met with efficiency higher than
z is drawn in Nu (z). As a consequence, the set of potential lenders drawn by entrepreneur
eu is the random variable Θeu , which is the sum of potential banking partners met in each
of the N submarkets. Θeu reflects the strength of search frictions affecting the submarket u;
in a frictionless world, each entrepreneur from u would meet with all bank branches in the
economy and, in turn, would end up applying for a credit from their optimal banking partner
(i.e. the first-best match)12 . In decentralized credit markets with search frictions hindering
the number of meetings and price quotes, the first-best match is not always feasible as an
entrepreneur may never meet with the right loan officer.


In Eaton et al. (2018) and Lenoir et al. (2018), there is no firm heterogeneity and the
likelihood to meet with a supplier from v is the same for all the firms in u. I instead
assume that entrepreneurs heterogeneity matters and reflects the fact that more productive
entrepreneurs incur lower search costs. I model the search process as independent draws in
the distribution of bank branches; each bank branch bu located in u has the probability zev κuv
to be drawn by entrepreneur ev located in v. zev stands for the firm productivity (normalized
such that zev ∈ [0, 1]). κuv (also ∈ [0, 1]) can be interpreted as a pair-specific u-v inverse
measure of the strength of search frictions. Formally, P[bu ∈ Θev ] = zev κuv and Θev (u), the
number of bank branches from u met by an entrepreneur from v, follows a binomial law such
that:

                                    Card(Θev (u)) = zev κuv · Su zmin                                   (1.7)

Under the Poisson limit theorem, the binomial law of parameters (zev κuv , Sv zmin ) can be
                                                         −θ
approximated by a Poisson law of parameter zev κuv · Sv zmin ; this approximation is used in
  12
     Note that, without search frictions, all entrepreneurs located in the same submarket may end up applying
for credit from the exact same bank branch, if only branch productivity matters (Cerqueiro et al. (2011) shows
that branch heterogeneity goes far beyond productivity). This will lead to positive assortative matching and
directed search.

the rest of the analysis. This modelling has two major implications. First, more productive
firms will, mechanically, meet with more bank branches, not only locally but also in distant
submarkets. De facto, productive entrepreneurs are more likely to find a good match among
Θev while entrepreneurs with a low productivity may end up with only a few bad quotes. Sec-
ond, heterogeneity in κuv across submarkets implies that entrepreneurs’ search will be biased
geographically toward submarkets in which search frictions are low. An important feature
of the search process is that bank branches heterogeneity does not affect the probability of
meeting; in particular, there is no directed search toward the most productive branches. I
argue that this is a reasonable assumption, given the fact that branch characteristics (spe-
cialization, growth rate, etc.) as well as loan officer background, preferences and bargaining
ability are difficult to assess from an outsider. This echoes Cerqueiro et al. (2011) notion
of loan officer discretion in the loan rate setting process, especially for small and opaque
businesses. Gathering information about How much a bank branch will be a good fit turns
out to be costly and complex, so I assume that branch characteristics are ex-ante unobserved
and do not affect the meeting probability.


Conditional on meeting with a loan officer in u, entrepreneur ev pitches its investment project
and get a price quote. I assume a simplistic bank pricing strategy (bank branches always
price at their marginal cost, as in a perfect competition framework) and a reduced-form cost
function that depends on both branch and entrepreneur productivity, exogenous unit cost
cu and transportation cost duv . The interest rate offered by bank branch bu to lend to the
entrepreneur ev writes rbu ,ev = zceu dzuv 13
                                              . The interest rate decreases with branch-firm distance
                                    v bu
and the unit cost of production, and is negatively correlated to both branch and entrepreneur
productivity. It summarizes and aggregates all the costs linked to information asymmetries
faced by the loan officer: screening, monitoring and transportation costs discussed above.


The assumption of bank branches pricing at their marginal cost is strong, in particular in
a context of credit markets subject to informational asymmetries. As pointed out in Lenoir
et al. (2018), an alternative is to assume that bank branches compete à la Bertrand: the
branch that offers the best contract terms doesn’t price at its marginal cost, but equals the
marginal cost of the branch with the second best offer. Another alternative is to assume a
Nash bargaining equilibrium in which the branch with the best offer and the entrepreneur
share the surplus of the match. Under the assumption of inelastic demand, competition
  13
    The bank branch bu program writes: Πu = zmatch Kr − Kcu duv with zmatch = f (zbu , zev ). I assume a
multiplicative reduced-form expression for f (zbu , zev ) which is quite common in the labor literature where
the productivity of a worker-firm match is simply the product of both productivities.


                                                     63


à la Bertrand and Nash bargaining do not affect the model predictions about firm-branch
matching. Since firm-branch matching is the main outcome of my model, I keep the marginal
cost pricing assumption for the sake of simplicity.


After meeting with all the loan officers in Θev , the entrepreneur ev decides to match with
the one offering the best contract terms (i.e. lowest interest rate). The interest rate paid by
ev writes:
                                                   cu duv
                                    rev = argmin{          }                               (1.8)

The poisson search process combined with the Pareto distribution of brank branches size
allows an analytical formula for rev . Eaton et al. (2018) demonstrates that the assumption
of Poissons draws into a Pareto distribution delivers a Weibull distribution for the minimum
interest rate introduced in equation 1.8. Formally:

Conditional on r fixed, entrepreneurs in submarket v obtain on average a best offer if the level
of competition is high (i.e. N                     −θ

                                u=1 Su · (cu duv )    is large), due to the proximity with vast and
crowded submarkets. In the same vein, the lower the search frictions faced by entrepreneurs
in v (i.e. the greater κuv ) the better the contract terms will be, on average. Finally, the
entrepreneur’s productivity directly impacts on the likelihood to be matched with a branch
that offers a low interest rate because more productive entrepreneurs draw a larger set Θev
of potential lenders that somehow compensates the adverse effect of search frictions. Note
that a larger θ also alleviate the negative impact of search frictions, but mostly in favor of
less productive entrepreneurs: indeed, less heterogeneity between bank branches advantages
the entrepreneurs with the least price quotes.


3.2.   Predictions
In this section, I derive a number of theoretical predictions about i) the magnitude of aggre-
gate credit flows between any two submarkets, ii) firm-branch matching and iii) the number
of clients by bank branch along the distribution of branch’s productivity. I then investigate
how a shock on search frictions modifies those predictions.

Aggregate Credit Flows

In section 2.1 and 2.3, I document the existence of inter submarket lending: while most of
the credit is distributed locally, with borrowers and lenders located in the same urban unit,
some branches operate in remote submarkets. Let Πuv be the share of credit granted in
submarket v by bank branches located in submarket u (over the total credit borrowed by
firms in v ). As all investment projects share the same size, normalized to one, the expected
share of credit distributed in v by branches located in u is the sum over all entrepreneurs in
v of a dummy variable equal to one if the entrepreneur is matched with a branch in u, zero
otherwise:                               PFv
                                                I{M(ev ) = u}

                                                  ev =1 1


where M(ev ) = u indicates that entrepreneur ev decides to match with a branch from u.
Lenoir et al. (2018) shows that using the law of large numbers, Πuv is equal to the expected
value of I{M(ev ) = u} across entrepreneurs in v, which is the probability that the best con-
tract terms offered to any entrepreneur in v comes from a branch u. Here, a crucial condition
is that random variables I{M(ev ) = u} are independent and identically distributed, which
is straightforward if entrepreneurs are ex-ante identical. In my case, with entrepreneur’s
heterogeneity, I show that this condition holds as the likelihood to ultimately match with a
submarket u does not depend on zev . Thus, equation 1.10 writes:
                                  h             i   h             i

First, equation 1.15 indicates that the likelihood for an entrepreneur located in v to match
with a bank branch from u does not vary along the distribution of productivity. When zev
increases, the number of branches drawn by ev in u mechanically increases but so do the
number of branches drawn in others competing submarkets (∀k 6= u), which results in a con-
stant probability of matching with u. Entrepreneur productivity only impacts the contract
terms, not the destination of the match. Second, under the assumption that Pareto distri-
butions of bank branches productivity share the same shape parameter θ across submarkets,
P[{ M(ev ) = u}|r] is the same for each price quote r. Thus, the structural expression for the
share of credit distributed in v by branches located in u is:

Two forces are at stake: i) the relative magnitude of search frictions between submarkets
u and v with respect to the magnitude of search frictions affecting all the other potential
submarkets k 6= u and ii) the relative size and efficiency of the submarket u compared to
submarkets sizes and efficiencies in the rest of the economy. From, equation 1.16, I derive
two predictions about aggregate credit flows and the impact of a shock on search frictions
κuv .

Prediction 1: Gravity Equation for Bank Credit. As shown in Lenoir et al. (2018), a log-
linearization of equation 1.16 delivers a gravity equation for the share of credit distributed
in v by branches located in u:

                         log Πuv = log κuv − θ · log duv + FEv + FEu                       (1.17)

tions are not common in the finance literature, with notable exceptions for cross-border
equity flows (Portes and Rey, 2005), bonds ans bank holdings (Coeurdacier and Martin,
2009). Recently, Okawa and van Wincoop (2012) proposed a theoretical foundation of a
gravity equation for cross-border asset holdings gravity including financial frictions in the
form of informational asymmetries about assets future returns. To the best of my knowledge,
this paper is the first to propose a structural gravity equation for within-country bank credit
flows with two types of informational asymmetries.

Prediction 2: A Shock on Search Frictions. I investigate the effect of a reduction of bilateral
search frictions – e.g. the development of Broadband Internet and online banking services
– on aggregate credit flows. First-order condition of equation 1.17 with respect to κuv leads
to:
                                ∂ ln κuv h ∂ ln N                         −θ i

Two opposite mechanisms are at stake. First, a reduction of search frictions has a direct and
strictly positive effect (a) on bilateral credit flows. This connectivity effect reflects the fact
that it becomes less costly for entrepreneurs located in v to gather information about bank

branches and loan officers in u and to meet with them. Formally, the likelihood of meeting
with a bank branch from u increases for each entrepreneur in v ; i.e. there will be in average
more bank branches from u in Θev . Second, the competition effect (b) captures the increasing
competition between bank branches, conditional on being met, induced by the higher number
                                                                           −θ
of potential banking partners. The expression (b) rewrites PN Suκ(cuSduv(c) d )−θ ≥ 0, such that
                                                             k=1 kv k k kv
the competition effect is negative and may compensate the direct effect of connectivity.
Equation 1.18 simplifies in:

                         ∂ ln Πuv    1       Su (cu duv )−θ
                                  =     − PN                         ≥0                  (1.19)
                          ∂ κuv     κuv    k=1 κkv S k (c k dkv ) −θ




Note that the effect of a reduction of search frictions κuv in heterogeneous across submarkets
u. The larger or closer a submarket, the smaller the total impact. This captures the fact
that large and nearby submarket already benefits from a visibility advantage; entrepreneurs
in v easily meet with bankers from those very accessible and visible submarkets which, in
turn, are able to offer attractive contract terms. In contrast, small and remote submarkets
benefit more for a reduction of search frictions.

Branch-Entrepreneur Matching

I investigate the matching process between an entrepreneur located in v and any bank branch
located in the N submarkets. I derive predictions about (i) the number and the quality of
entrepreneurs that ultimately match with a particular bank branch and (ii) the impact of a
reduction of search frictions on the matching equilibrium. Both predictions can be confronted
to firm-branch relationship data from the Credit Register and to motivating empirical work
presented in 2.

Prediction 3: Positive Assortative Matching. I consider a bank branch located in u and its
likelihood Fbu (ev ) to lend to the entrepreneur ev located in v as a result of the search and
matching process. Fbu (ev ) can be decomposed as the likelihood for entrepreneur ev to draw
and meet with bu and then, the likelihood for bu to be the lowest cost supplier. Formally:
                                                     cu duv         

                               = P bu ∈ Θev × 1 − P(rev < rbu )                          (1.20)


From equation 1.9 for minimum price distribution, I have an analytical formula for P(rev ≤

rbu )14 . By definition of the random search process, P(bu ∈ Θev ) = zev κuv . Thus, the model
delivers the following expression for the likelihood that ev ultimately decide to borrow from
bu , namely Fbu (ev ):
                                                                            N
                                                                             X                          
                  Fbu (ev ) = zev κuv × exp        −   (cu duv )θ zb−θ
                                                                    u
                                                                       zev                     −θ
                                                                                   Su · (cu duv ) κuv       (1.21)
                                                                             u=1



The likelihood of a match between branch bu and entrepreneur ev strictly increases in zbu
and zev . The branch productivity has a simple and direct effect via the attractiveness
of the price quote while the entrepreneur productivity has two distinct impacts: a direct
positive effect on the meeting likelihood that appears in the first part of equation 1.21 and
a negative but smaller effect – in the exponential term – that captures a competition effect
(conditional on meeting, the likelihood of being the lowest cost bank branch decreases with
the number of other branches met). This indicates a positive assortative matching between
very productive branches and entrepreneurs. On the contrary, low-productivity bank offices
are likely to match only with unproductive entrepreneurs that do not enjoy a large set of
potential partners. This is consistent with empirical evidence from the Probit regression
presented in section 2: the product of branch and firm size is positively correlated with
branch-firm matching, as the branch growth rate is.

Prediction 4: Firm-Branch Matching and Search Frictions. The first-order condition of
equation 1.21 with respect to κuv indicates How the matching process is affected by a shock
on bilateral search frictions between any two submarkets u and v.

Similar to Prediction 2, the impact of a reduction of search frictions is twofold, with a direct
and positive connectivity effect (a) and an indirect and negative competition effect (b). The
connectivity effect captures the enhanced visibility of the bank branch. The competition

effect reflects the fact that, conditional on being drawn, it becomes more difficult to offer
the lowest price quote. Equation 1.22 offers a reduced-form expression that summarizes both
effects:

                                 ∂ ln Fbu (ev )    1   Su ze
                                                =     − θ v                            (1.22)
                                    ∂ κuv         κuv   zbu

The impact of search frictions varies along the distribution of branch productivities. High-
productivity branches (high zbu ) benefit more form the reduction of search costs as the
direct impact dominates the competition effect: those large and efficient branches located
in v now meet with much more entrepreneurs from v and, conditional on being met, enjoy
a dominant position compared to smaller and less productive branches when it comes to
offer attractive contact terms. Their likelihood to be the lowest price quote and, then, to
ultimately be chosen, increases. On the contrary, low-productivity branches that previously
benefited from the low level of competition (i.e. few other branches drawn from u) are now
exposed to a tougher rivalry.



4.     Empirical Context
In this section, I provide a description of my empirical strategy. I exploit the staggered
deployment of Broadband Internet in France between 1998 and 2005 as a large scale quasi-
natural experiment to study the impact of a reduction of search frictions on credit markets.
First, I present the technological and institutional context of Broadband Internet diffusion
in France. Second, I document the adoption of ICTs by French banks and How high-speed
Internet is likely to reduce search frictions for SMEs. Third, I discuss the identification
strategy and propose a new IV for Broadband Internet deployment.


4.1.   The Rise of Online Banking
In the early 2000’s, the large diffusion of ICTs represented a profound change for the banking
industry and Broadband Internet was the catalyst for this numerical transformation. As dig-
itization proceeded apace, the dimensions of banks’ digital evolution varied among segments
and products. Digitization became the norm for retail credit processes with personal-loan
applications submitted with a few swipes on a mobile phone, and time to cash can now
be as short as a few minutes (McKinsey, 2018). Not only transaction costs decreased: the
rise of online price comparison services and brokers allows individuals to search for the best


                                             70


banking partner in a faster and more efficient way15 . The combination of both transaction
and search costs reduction resulted in a severe disruption of search frictions for individuals.

Regarding corporate credit and SME lending, the situation is mixed. The loan officer re-
mains the most relevant interlocutor and the ultimate decision-maker in SME lending, as
He is ideally suited to understand client’s specific needs and characteristics as well as local
market and industry performance, leaving little room for automation. The complexity of
loan pricing for SMEs also prevents the use of online brokers or interest rate comparison
websites. However, ICTs affected many aspects of the firm-bank relationship, especially for
SMEs: recent survey on UK SMEs (Ernst and Young, 2018) shows that financial services
used by SMEs are mainly online banking (85%) and second, branch-based banking (43%),
emphasizing the growing importance of digitization. Among other examples, emails allow
firms to easily contact a loan officer, online data and document sharing speeds up the meet-
ing process and reduces transaction costs. Bank websites are showcases designed to attract
new customers and provide information about financial products. Finally, customer online
areas facilitate communication.

In order to document the fact that French banks had started their digital transition process at
the beginning of the 2000’s, I gather new data on large French bank adoption of ICTs; First,
I check the existence of the bank website with a firm customer area before 2000 (using the
waybackmachine.com website). Second, I collect the exact date of the domain name creation
(available on nom-domaine.fr). The six largest French banks, which represent around 90% of
the total amount of credit granted to firms, were already active online at the beginning of the
2000’s, with a sophisticated website, while their domain name were registered in average in
the mid-90’s, showing an early preoccupation for online visibility. In particular, the average
website demonstrate the willingness of banks to improve the accessibility of basic but crucial
information to their future SME clients: in a few clicks, it was possible for a new client to
get an appointment, find all the bank branches in the area or to ask for information about
financial products and services. For each bank branch, the phone number, the contact email
and the physical address were immediately available. This represent a sharp reduction of
search costs born by the entrepreneur.
  15
    Mortgage lending is more complex due to regulatory constraints, yet banks in many developed markets
have managed to digitize large parts of the mortgage journey. More than one bank has set an aspiration to
automate 95 % of retail underwriting decisions.

4.2.   The diffusion of Broadband Internet in France
The ADSL technology

The ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is a data communication technology that
enables fast data transmission over copper telephone lines (much faster than what a conven-
tional voiceband modem could provide). In the ADSL technology, bandwidth and bit rate
are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater towards the customer premises (downstream)
than the reverse (upstream). Eligibility for ADSL depends on the distance between the final
customer (e.g. home or office) and the Local Exchange (LEs), since the intensity and the
quality of the analog signal decreases as it is routed over the copper lines. Local Exchanges
are the telephone exchanges owned by the incumbent operator France Télécom (later re-
named Orange) into which subscribers’ telephone lines end. As of 2008, there were about
17 000 LEs spread throughout the country. Initially dedicated to the telephone network,
LEs are essential for Internet users who subscribe to ADSL as they aggregate local traffic
and then direct it via the so-called backbone (i.e. higher levels of the network) towards the
world wide web. A key feature of the ADSL technology is that one can supply high-speed
Internet by upgrading the LE while relying on the existing (copper) local loop to connect
the premises of the final customers. The upgrading involves the installation of an equipment
inside the LE called a DSLAM (Digital subscriber line access multiplexer) that is required in
order to recover the data transmitted via ADSL on the local copper loop and adapt it so it
can be transmitted to the higher levels of the network (which are typically relying on optical
fiber). The upgrading of local LEs is the key source of variation I will use in my empirical
analysis.

The ADSL roll-out in France

The ADSL technology became popular during the 1990s, as many OECD countries were
planning the expansion of services related to information and communications technology.
In the early 2000s in France, the deployment of the technology beyond France’s largest cities
was slow. The causes for this staggered deployment are multiple. First, France Telecom
(FT), the monopolistic telecom supplier at the time and still the main supplier today, was
unsure as to whether it was going to be able to make the upgraded infrastructure available
to new competitors with a positive markup or not. The uncertainty regarding the wholesale
price FT was going to be able to charge made the firm reluctant to upgrade LEs beyond the
largest cities (see Sénat, 2002, p.232). This uncertainty was lifted after a series of decisions by
the regulatory agency set the conditions of that wholesale market (Arcep, 2002). Moreover,


                                                72


at the same time France Telecom had to invest massively in upgrading its LEs to ADSL,
it went through an debt crisis which ended with what was essentially a government bailout
in 2002. One can find anecdotal evidence of the impatience of the French government in
accounts of Parliamentary debate (at the Senate) regarding the excessively slow expansion
of broadband internet (Tregouet, 2001) and the difficult cooperation between the French
government (the Ministry in charge of the Industry) and France Télécom. Under the impulse
of the government – which increased its stake in the firm during the 2002 bailout of the firm
– France Telecom pledged in 2003 to cover 90% of the French (metropolitan) population
by the end of 2005, i.e. all local exchanges (LEs) with more than 1000 lines, for a total
investment of 600 M euros (750 M euros in 2018 prices) (Telecom, 2003).

Overall, the account of the broadband expansion in France over the period suggests that
it was gradual due to uncertainty regarding the capacity of France Telecom to undergo
the investment until 2002. After 2002, with the strong impulse of the government, France
Telecom started covering more secondary areas with a focus on the overall number of lines
per LE with only limited attention paid to local economic potential. While accelerated, the
coverage remained gradual due to operational limits on the part of FT and took about 2
more years than anticipated in 2003.


4.3.    Identification and Instrumental Variable
Similar to Magouyres et al. (2019), my identification strategy is based the gradual diffusion
of the new technology in different LEs over space and time. Note that the question of
what were the criteria for deciding to treat one LE before another has been studied in
Magouyres et al. (2019). Empirical evidence shows that the main determinant of Broadband-
Internet expansion was the city-level population density, with no role for levels or trends in
the economic patterns of the city, and was slow down by the sunk cost of upgrading the
infrastructure, consistent with statistical analysis16 .

In this paper, I propose an instrument variable strategy based on a theoretical optimal
investment plan for infrastructure upgrading. The ADSL technology combines local copper
loops and a large optic fiber network. Thus, when France Télécom decided to connect a
specific city with Broadband Internet, the total cost of the project was twofold: the cost
  16
    In particular, the authors highlight the fact that broadband expansion occurring to maximize population
coverage with no special consideration for economic potential is strongly supported by a statistical analysis
of the determinants of broadband coverage that is carried out in their paper. Different to their paper, my
treatment is continuous and I can’t rely on a dynamic event-study approach and check for the pre-trends.
For this reason, I propose an IV strategy for the timing of Broadband expansion.



                                                     73


of upgrading the LE and the connection cost between the LE and the global optical cable
network, which depends on the physical distance between the LE and the closest optic fiber
cable. On the other hand, the gain for the internet supplier to upgrade a LE was proportional
to the number of inhabitant newly connected. My optimal theoretical investment plan
opposes the connection costs to the connection gains for each city. The gains are the number
of potential clients (measured before 1999) reached consequent to a LE upgrading and I use
the distance (in km) to the closest optic fiber as a proxy of the connection costs.


                              [FIGURE 1.11 ABOUT HERE]


A key feature of this instrumental variable strategy lies in the exogeneity of the distance
between a LE and the closest optical fiber cable, as the optic fiber network construction was
anterior to the ADSL expansion. The network has been built, in part, by other economic
actors, before 1998 and for a completely different purpose. Indeed, highway firms and the
French railway company (SNCF) installed optic fiber cables along the lines (respectively,
the roadsides) for fast data transmission: surveillance videos, internal communications, etc.
France Télécom leased the existing infrastructure to those company in order to faster Broad-
band expansion. Figure 1.11 displays the location of around 13,000 Local Exchanges, high-
ways and railroads already existing before the beginning of Broadband Internet expansion
in France. For each LE, I compute the shortest geodesic distance to a highway or a railroad,
and use this as a proxy of connection costs.


                              [FIGURE 1.12 ABOUT HERE]


Formally, I predict the optimal connection rank R̂i for the Local Exchange i, only taking into
account two presumably exogenous measures of costs and gains. I use this optimal connection
rank R̂i in place of the observed rank Ri to predict the theoretical year of connection, and,
thus, Ẑit . As a consequence, the optimal connection rank is not polluted by concomitant
or correlated economic shocks that may affect the connection timing and only depends on
preexisting and time-unvarying city characteristics:

                Ri = α + β1 · Densityi,1998 + β2 · Shortest Distancei,1998 + i
                R̂i = α̂ + βˆ1 · Densityi,1998 + βˆ2 · Shortest Distancei,1998

Figure 1.12 shows the rank correlation between optimal versus observed connection ranks.
The combination of exogenous connection gains and costs have a strong predictive power,


                                              74


with a R-square close to 0.70. Finally, the mapping between the predicted connection rank
R̂i and the connectivity variable Ẑit follows the correspondence between Ri and Zit observed
in the data, such that Ẑit and Zit also display a strong positive correlation. Finally, I define
the degree of connection between two urban units as Cuvt = Zvt × Zut . Cuvt belongs to
[0, 1]. This measure captures the ability for firms located in u to locate and communicate
with bank branches located in v, using the world wide web. My instrument variable strategy
delivers a similar measure of between urban unit connectivity named Ĉuvt = Ẑvt × Ẑut


5.        Empirical Approach
In this section, I describe my empirical approach. I test the three main predictions from the
model: (i) inter-regional credit flows follow a gravity equation, (ii) the Broadband Internet
roll-out affects inter-regional flows through a reduction in search frictions and finally (iii) the
Broadband Internet roll-out affects firm-branch matching.


5.1.       Gravity Equation for Aggregate Credit Flows
I use data on bilateral credit exposure from the Credit Register, aggregated at the urban-unit
level for all single-city SMEs in my sample, in order to compute bilateral credit shares Πuvt .
Πuvt is the amount of credit granted by bank branches located in u to SMEs located in v,
over the total credit stock of SMEs in v. Πuvt lies in [0, 1], 0 indicates that none of the firms
located in v borrow credit from a bank branch located in u at date t (i.e. the aggregate
credit flow from v to u is null). On the contrary, Πuvt equals 1 implies that firms in v are fully
financed by branches in u. In an economy without inter-regional exchanges, all Πuvt would
equal 0, except Πuut as all firms would be financed by local bank branches. Alternatively, I
use other measures of flows to distinguish between the extensive and the intensive margin:
the total amount of credit granted to firms in v by branches in u, the average loan granted,
the number of firms in v financed by u or the share of firms financed by u.

Baseline Specification. A very broad literature in international trade studies the gravity
equation and its estimation (see Head and Mayer, 2014 for an overview). Santos Silva and
Tenreyro (2006, 2011) show that the Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estima-
tor, introduced by Gourieroux et al. (1984), is a promising workhorse for the estimation of
gravity equations, in particular in the presence of many zeros. It is perfectly suited for the
estimation of multiplicative models, without log-linearization of the dependent variable.17
  17
       The PPML estimator identifies the coefficients using the same first-order conditions that are used by



                                                      75


I adopt this standard approach and rely on the new estimator for pseudo-poisson regres-
sion models with multiple high-dimensional fixed-effects developed by Correia et al. (2019).
Formally, I estimate equation 1.17 in its multiplicative form:

                                                                         
                     Yuvt   = exp ln Svt + ln Mut + β1 ln duv + β2 ln Xuvt + uvt                  (1.23)


where Yuvt is the bilateral dependent variable (credit flows, shares, number of clients served,
etc.) aggregated at the urban-unit level. u, v and t are indices for origin (the urban unit from
which the bank branches operate), destination (the urban unit in which the borrowing firms
are located) and time. Svt and Mut are the origin urban unit × year and the destination urban
unit × year fixed effects; fixed-effects ensure the theoretical restrictions implied by structural
gravity are satisfied. Xuvt is a vector of time-varying pair characteristics (e.g. trade of goods
between urban units u and v, dummy variable for belonging to the same department, region,
etc.) that may affect firm-bank matching and financial decisions. Finally, I do not include a
pair specific fixed effect as my goal is to identify the coefficient β1 associated with physical
distance duv between u and v. Here, the physical distance captures both the monitoring
costs and the search frictions: according to my model and consistent to gravity estimation
in international trade and finance, β1 should be negative.

Impact of Broadband Internet Diffusion. I study the impact of a reduction of search
frictions on aggregate credit flows using the staggered diffusion of Broadband Internet, i.e.
prediction 1.18 of the model. I impose the following functional form for log κuvt = γ Cuvt +
%Xuvt +εuvt . Inspired by the international trade literature that investigate the impact of time-
varying trade policies as trade agreements, I consistently identify the effect of time-varying
connectivity between urban units using a dynamic PPML estimator with fixed-effect in a
difference-in-difference setting. Namely, I add to the baseline equation the time-varying
variable of interest Iuvt that captures the pair specific variation in online connectivity (the
reduction of search frictions):
                                                                            
              Yuvt   = exp ln Sut + ln Mvt + β1 ln duv + β2 ln Xuvt + β3 Cuvt + uvt               (1.24)


The goal is to consistently estimate the average effect of Cuvt , a continuous variable indicating
the degree of internet connectivity between u and v, using a structural gravity specification
the ML estimator derived from the Poisson distribution, however it does not require the dependant variable
to be Poisson distributed (Fally, 2015)



                                                   76


derived from the model. The origin × year and destination × year fixed effects – Svt and Mut
– are crucial as they absorb all the time-varying impacts of Broadband Internet which are
not pair specific18 . Another widely used specification includes dyadic fixed-effects, namely
origin-destination-time FE, in order to absorb all time-invariant pair characteristics that
may be correlated with the likelihood of being mutually connected. I propose an alternative
version of specification 1.24 including pair-specific fixed-effect: a direct consequence is that
I cannot estimate the coefficient β1 relating to the physical distance duv in this specification.

PPML: Difference-in-Difference with Many Zeros? A key aspect of the empirical
strategy is based on the performance of the PPML estimator with multiple high-dimensional
fixed-effects. Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2011) shows that the PPML estimator is well
behaved (and outperforms the OLS) when the dependent variable displays a large proportion
of zeros, using a Monte-Carlo approach. In this paper, I extend and adapt their simulation
exercise to the exact case of my empirical setting. Not only my estimating sample contains
a vast majority of urban unit pairs that do not exchange credit over the entire period 1998-
2005 (more than 95% of the credit shares equal zero) but also I have to deal with panel data
and a difference-in-difference approach.

I present simulation evidence on the performance of the PPML estimator when the panel
data is generated by a constant elasticity model, with (i) a large proportion of zeros, (ii) a
time-varying shock and (iii) when all units are not simultaneously treated. In these simula-
tions, the non-negative dependent variable Yuvt is generated so that P(Yuvt = 0) is substantial
                           0
and E(Yuvt |Xuvt )=exp(β Xuvt ). A the best of my knowledge, this is the first simulation ev-
idence of the performance of the PPML estimator in this particular setting, that echoes
a wide range of papers in international trade that investigate the impact of trade policies
within a gravity framework.


Following Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2011), the dependent variable Yuvt – which is the total
credit granted by branches in v to firms in u – is generated as a finite mixture model of
the form Yuvt = m
                P uvt
                   j=1 zjuvt , where muvt is the number of components of the mixture, and
zjuvt a continuous random variable with support in R+, distributed independently of muvt .
This data generation process has a direct economic interpretation in my framework. muvt
is the number of bank branches located in v that serve firms in u, and zjuvt is the amount
  18
    Broadband Internet not only affects search frictions, but might also impact urban unit sizes, exogenous
production costs or branch and firms productivity – in this setting, that does not bias the β3 point estimate
because of the urban units-time fixed-effects.



                                                     77


of credit that each those banks lent their clients located in u. Because muvt and zjuvt are
independant, E(Yuvt |Xuvt ) = E(muvt |Xuvt ) × E(zjuvt |Xuvt ). As in Santos Silva and Tenreyro
(2011), zjuvt is obtained from a gamma distribution with mean 1 and variance 2, which is
equivalent to a χ2(1) random variable. This implies, that conditionally on muvt , Yuvt follows a
χ2muvt and then E(Yuvt |Xuvt ) = E(muvt |Xuvt ). muvt will be generated as a negative-binomial
                                                   0
random variable with conditional mean exp(β Xuvt ) and a variance equal to aE(muvt |Xuvt )
+ bE(muvt |Xuvt )2 . I propose the following functional form for E(Yuvt |Xuvt ):

              E(Yuvt |Xuvt ) = E(muvt |Xuvt ) = exp(β0 + β1 x1uv + β2 x2uvt + β3 x3uvt )


where x1uv is the product of the sum of two time invariant variables drawn from a standard
normal x1u and x1v . x2uvt is a time-varying variable equal to 1 with probability close to
0.4. Formally, I impose a dynamic structure for x2uvt by introducing the underlying variable
w2uvt = γw2uvt−1 + ρuvt , with γ = 1.05, ρ = 1.5 and uvt is drawn from a standard normal,
such that x2uvt = I(w2uvt > 0.6). x3uvt is a city pair specific treatment dummy variable that
equals one after the time of treatment t and zero before. The city pair specific treatment
time is drawn from a discrete uniform distribution over the support [t0 , T ]. Formally, I
generate city specific treatment date x3u ∼ U [t0 , T ] and define x3uvt = I(t > max(x3u , x3v )).
Finally, I impose β0 = 0, β1 = -1, β2 = 1 and β3 = 0.1. This functional form has again a
direct economic interpretation. The time-invariant variable x1uv (which is symmetrical by
definition, i.e., x1uv = x1vu ) represents the distance between u and v, x2uvt models the time-
varying determinants of credit flows between cities and x3uvt is analogous to my broadband
internet interconnection shock. To complete my simulation setting, I need to define the
conditional variance of muvt and Yuvt . I follow Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2011) considering
the quadratic specification Var(muvt ) = aE(muvt |Xuvt ) + bE(muvt |Xuvt )2 so that:

                    Var(Yuvt |Xuvt ) = (1 + 2a)E(muvt |Xuvt ) + 2bE(muvt |Xuvt )2

Picking the value of a and b allows to generate a high probability of zeros and different
heteroskedasticity patterns. Table 1.8 presents the results obtained with 1,000 replicas of
the simulation procedure described here, in which the number of cities N is set to 200 and
T equals 10. The estimation sample is therefore composed of 200 × 200 × 10 = 400,000
observations. In the top panel, a = 50 and b = 0 while a is set to 1 and b to 5 in the
bottom panel. The table displays the point estimate and the standard errors obtained with
the different estimators, namely PPML and GPML19 with and without origin × year and
 19
      GPML stands for Gamma Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood is a PPML-like estimation procedure in which



                                                 78


destination × year fixed-effects. These results confirm and extend the findings of Santos Silva
and Tenreyro (2006, 2011), showing that both the PPML and the GPML estimators are well
behaved in the two cases considered. In particular, the coefficient of interest β3 is consistently
estimated with two-way unit × fixed effects.These findings are an additional reason that
justify my empirical approach and the validity of my estimation procedure.


5.2.    Firm-Branch Matching
I then test how Broadband Internet diffusion affects the likelihood of firm-branch matching
and the number of remote firms from u financed by a bank branch located in v. For this
purpose, I leverage bank branch-level data in order to verify Prediction 4 in a dynamic event-
study approach, similar to Magouyres et al. (2019). I estimate a dynamic specification where
I allow the effect on a branch b located in city u at year t, to vary with time-from-treatment.


The level of observation being a branch b located in city u, I’m able to discretize the treatment
status by setting treatment status to 1 after the city experienced its highest increase in the
predicted treatment variable Ẑitcity-level . Formally, I define the year of treatment as ti0 =
argmaxt {∆Ẑitcity-level } and discretized treatment status as 1{t ≥ ti0 }. The year of treatment
for each city is denoted ti0 . I index time-to-treatment with d (negative before treatment,
positive after). The sample covers the years 1998 to 2005, and I restrict the set of observations
where d ∈ {−6, −5, ..., +4, +5}. The main estimating equation is as follows:

                             d=5
                                     βd × 1{t = d + t0u } + x0ut δ + αb(u) + ψr(u),t + εut
                             X
                  Yb(u)t =                                                                   (1.25)
                             d=−5
                             d6=−1


where αb(u) and ψr(u),t are fixed effects for the branch b located in city i and for the de-
partment (of the city)-year, and x0ut is a vector of time-dependent city-level covariates. I
drop two indicator variables for d = −5 and d = −1. That restriction is necessary to avoid
multi-colinearity and to identify the fully-dynamic underlying data generating process in
the staggered design (Borusyak and Jaravel, 2017; Gross et al., 2018). To ensure that this
restriction is not influential in the results, I display results with alternative normalizations
in the robustness section.


The specification presented in equation (1.25) includes leads and lags. The inclusion of leads
the dependant variable is a share instead of the value in level.


                                                       79


allows us to assess the presence of pre-trends. We also estimate a simpler “semi-dynamic”
specification where only the lags of the treatment are included, as presented in equation
(1.26):

                             d=5
                                   βd × 1{t = d + t0u } + x0ut δ + αv + ψr(u),t + εut
                             X
                  Yb(u)t =                                                                (1.26)
                             d=0


The event-study coefficients βbd estimated from equation (1.25) can be interpreted causally
under the identifying assumption that, conditional on receiving broadband over the period
considered and conditional on bank branch and city fixed-effects, the timing of broadband
roll-out is unrelated to the outcome. The presence of systematic local factors that would drive
both broadband and trade would be cause for concern. This potential issue is investigated
by assessing the sensitivity of the coefficients to the inclusion of a large set of controls and
fixed effects meant to account for city and well as local labor market shocks. Finally, the
outcome variable Yb(u)t measures several aspects of the branch lending activity: i) the average
distance to clients, ii) the share of remote clients (located outside the branch’s urban unit),
and iii) the share of credit granted remotely (i.e. to remote clients).


6.     Results
This section presents the results. I first show that inter-regional credit flows follow a gravity
equation by estimating equation (1.23), using a pseudo-Poisson maximum likelihood ap-
proach. Then, I estimate equation (1.24) and document an increase in inter-regional credit
flows triggered by the staggered roll-out of Broadband Internet, associated with a reduction
in search frictions. Finally, I estimate equation (1.25) to document that Broadband Internet
diffusion allows banks to match with new firms located remotely. I show the results for
different specifications and assess the robustness of the results.

Gravity equation for aggregate trade flows. Table 1.3 shows the results for the esti-
mation of equation (1.23), using a pseudo-Poisson maximum likelihood approach described
in section 5.1. The dependant variable is the credit shares Πuvt , defined as the amount of
credit granted by bank branches located in u to SMEs located in v, over the total credit
stock of SMEs in v. Column (1) display the results with no control, origin urban unit × year
and destination urban unit × year fixed-effects. In columns (2) to (5), I sequentially add
pair-level controls: a dummy variable equal to 1 if both the firm and the bank are located
in the same region (région), in the same county (départment) and the lagged log of trade

flows between counties. The coefficient of interest β1 , associated to the log of the distance
between urban unit u and v, is negative and close to -2. This magnitude implies that firms
borrow credit from banks located in a close-by urban unit nearly four times more than from
similar banks located at twice the distance. The distance coefficient decreases but remains
close to -2 when I consider banks and firms located within the same region or county, or
when I control by lagged trade flows in column (4) which is the baseline specification.

and find coefficients twice as low, between -0.529 and -0.881. Recently, Brei and von Peter
(2018) run a similar estimation on international banking flows and adopt a PPML approach.
They find an estimate close to but smaller than one. A coefficient of magnitude -2 is also
larger than what is documented by the vast trade literature, comprising more than 2,500
estimates of the distance effect (Head and Mayer, 2014). Therefore, my results indicates that

distance-related frictions are likely to be more important at a very local level than for inter-
national credit flows. This confirm the local nature of credit markets for SMEs and echoes
the first-order importance of distance as a determinant of access to credit, well documented
in the banking literature (e.g., Petersen and Rajan, 1995; Agarwal and Hauswald, 2010)


For all u − v pairs with no bilateral credit flow, the share of credit is set to zero, which
represents the vast majority of the observations. For robustness, I run a similar estimation
but keeping only pairs of urban units with positive credit flows. Table 1.5 shows the results.
The coefficient of interest is still negative and significant, but of a smaller magnitude: β1 is
now close to -1 and remains stable to the addition of control variables.


Impact of a reduction in search frictions. I now test how the gravity equation for
inter-regional credit flows is distorted by a technology-induced reduction in search frictions.
I formally test the prediction (1.18) of my model by running a PPML estimation of the
augmented gravity equation (1.24). The main results of my paper are presented in Table
1.4, where the first column reproduces column (4) of Table 1.3 for comparison purposes.
In column (2), I include the continuous variable Cuvt for observed internet interconnection
between two urban units. Similar to Table 1.3, in order to estimate an effect on distance,
origin and destination × year fixed effects are included but not pair specific fixed effects.
The estimate is positive and significant, in line with the model prediction. It suggests that a
technology-induced reduction in search frictions distort the gravity equation for credit flows.
The amount of credit exchanged between firms and banks located in connected urban units
increases relative to other not-connected banking partners. The magnitude of the estimate
implies that the share of credit granted to firms located in v from banks located in a remote
urban unit u increases by 44% on average when u and v are connected. The estimate for
distance is not affected by the inclusion of the ADSL variable, nor the control for bilateral
trade flows.


My model predicts an heterogeneous effect of brandband internet with respect to distance
which is the result of two opposing forces: a connectivity effect (positive impact) and a
competition effect (negative impact). While the former dominates overall, the competition
effect could prevail for markets that are geographically close, as banks located in these close
markets already benefit from a visibility advantage. In contrast, remote submarkets benefit
more for a reduction of search frictions. I formally test this prediction by including the in-
teraction variable for the bilateral distance (expressed as deviation from the sample average)

                                              82


and the treatment variable in column (3). I find a positive and statistically significant effect
of the interaction variable with distance, which means that the elasticity of credit flows with
respect to distance decreases in magnitude with broadband internet. In other words, the
positive impact of a reduction in search frictions on credit flows is higher when two very
distant cities are connected, which verifies the intuition of the model. On the contrary, the
effect is almost null or even negative when two neighbouring cities, already economically
very closely tied, are interconnected by internet.

     Notes: PPML estimation of equation (1.23). duv = bilateral distance. Cuvt = Zvt × Zut , is a continuous vari-
     able that indicates the degree of broadband internet inter-connectivity between two urban units. Cuvt belongs
     to [0, 1]. This measure captures the ability for firms located in u to locate and communicate with bank branches
     located in v, using the world wide web. My instrument variable strategy delivers a similar measure of between
     urban unit connectivity named Ĉuvt = Ẑvt × Ẑut . Log trade flows is the lagged log of bilateral trade flows be-
     tween counties. Columns (1) to (5) include fixed effects for origin × years and destination × years. The sample

An important concern with those results is that potential endogeneity of internet take-up bi-
ases these estimates. In columns (4) and (5), I estimate equation (1.24) using the instrument
variable for broadband internet interconnection, namely Ĉuvt , instead of the observed con-

imprecisely estimated and implies that the share of credit granted to firms located in v from
banks located in a remote urban unit u now increases by only 6% when u and v are connected.

Notes: This figure plots the marginal effect of broadband internet with respect to distance between to

v by firms located in u, in %. The vertical grey dashed line represent the average distance between two cities

The results in column (5) documenting the heterogeneity of the effect with respect to dis-
tance are very comparable to those in column (3) that do not use the instrumental variable.
In particular, the interaction term is positive and significant. In economic terms, theses
results mean that an increase in internet availability of 10 percentage points increases credit
flows for an urban unit at the 25th distance percentile by 24% less than for an urban unit
at the 75th distance percentile. Figure 1.1 illustrates this heterogeneity. While the effect of
being interconnected is negative when cities are geographically nearby (competition effect
dominates), it increases sharply and because positive after the 50th kilometer. After the
100th kilometer the slope of the curve is then much flatter. Figure 1.15 in Appendix maps

the heterogeneous effect of being connected to Paris, showing that Marseille (second biggest
French city) benefit more than Lyon (third biggest city).


I then test for robustness along different dimensions. I first estimate the augmented gravity
equation (1.18) by adding bilateral pair fixed-effects that control for any unobserved char-
acteristics of the urban unit pair that are constant over time (see Head and Mayer, 2014).
Table 1.6 shows the results in columns (2) and (4). Although less significant and of lower
magnitude, they are virtually unchanged and confirm the positive but heterogeneous effect
of the technology-induced reduction in search frictions. Second, in order to take into account
the dynamic nature of credit flows, I replicate the baseline results by adding the lag depen-
dant variable to the regressors in Table 1.7. This implies that credit relationships existing
in the previous year provides a basis for the credit flows observed in the current year.20 The
main findings are confirmed by this alternative specification.


Firm-bank matching. The model predicts that broadband internet diffusion affects the
firm-branch matching process: the reduction in search frictions allows very distant firms and
bank to match and, in turn, the share of remote firms (located outside u) financed by a bank
located in u increases. I formally test prediction (1.22) leveraging micro bank branch-level
data in the dynamic event-study setting described above in section 5.2.


The main variable I consider is the share of credit lent by bank branches located in a given
city to firms located outside that city. With a high level of search frictions, matches between
firms and banks occur only locally, within cities, and the share of remote credit is close to
zero. On the contrary, if search is free, firms can meet with and borrow from banks located
far away and the share of credit lent remotely is large. I show the results for different spec-
ifications and assess the robustness of the results. I then turn to the extensive margin: the
share of firms located remotely financed by a bank in a given city.


Figure 1.2 displays the results, plotting estimated coefficients from equation (1.25). The
dark blue dots report results from the baseline specification including the bank branch and
county-year fixed-effects. Estimates exhibit a flat trend before the event (i.e. the normalizing
measure of time since access d = -1) and a break in the trend after that. The coefficient
for d = 5 in that specification is 0.018 suggesting that the expansion of access to broadband

Nickell bias in the dynamic model.

internet increased the bank branch-level share of credit lent to distant firms by about 10%, 5
years after the period of largest expansion. Not only this is in line with the model predictions
but also it is consistent with the aggregate impact on credit flows documented above. Our
second specification adds urban unit fixed-effects to the regression that aim to control for
time invariant city characteristics. The light blue dot show the estimates. Here again, I
find no sign of a pre-trend prior to broadband expansion contrasting with a steady growth
afterwards. The estimated effect after five years is virtually the same than in the baseline
case. Finally, the last set of coefficients plotted in royal blue represent a semi-dynamic ver-
sion of the baseline specification (see Equation 1.26). The regression should in theory more
efficiently estimated –as the number of parameters to be estimated is lower–, however both
the estimates and the standard errors stay very stable and close to the fully dynamic speci-

Notes: This figure plots estimates for specification in equation (1.25) – fully dynamic – and equation (1.26)
– semi-dynamic. The dependant variable is the share of clients financed outside the bank’s urban unit. The
sample include all bank branches with a positive credit exposure. The baseline specification (navy blue)

I then explore the possible mechanisms behind the bank-level increase in share of credit lent
to remote clients documented above. I study how the extensive margin of credit, i.e, the
number of banking relationships, is affected by the technology-induced reduction in search
frictions (as opposed to the average credit, the intensive margin). For this purpose, the
dependant variable I consider is the share of remote firms financed by bank branches located
in a given city, which is defined as the number of clients located outside the bank’s urban
unit divided by the total number of clients. Figure 1.3 displays the results. Similar to the
previous estimation, I find a flat pre-trend and a positive effect afterwards. The coefficient
for d = 5 now equals 0.023, implying that the technology-induced reduction in search fric-
tions increased the bank branch-level share of remote clients by about 12%, 5 years after the
period of largest expansion. Interestingly, the effect on the extensive margin is comparable
but slightly higher than the overall effect. This suggests that (i) the increase in between
cities credit flows is mainly driven by the creation of new relationships (new matches be-

                                                     87


tween banks and firms located in different cities), and (ii) that those new credit relationships
are in average smaller than the existing ones.


A direct consequence of these results is that firm-bank distance should increase following
Broadband Internet expansion, because there are more matches between firms and banks
located in different cities. I directly verify this hypothesis by running a similar dynamic
event-study regression with the (weighted) firm-bank distance as dependant variable. Figure
1.4 displays the results.

Notes: These figures plot estimates for specification in equation (1.25) – fully dynamic – and equation (1.26)
– semi-dynamic. In the left panel, the dependant variable is the (log) average firm-bank distance measured
at the branch level. In the right panel, the (log) distance is weighted by credit exposure. The sample include
all bank branches with a positive credit exposure. The baseline specification (navy blue) includes bank
branch fixed effects and year × county fixed-effects. Urban unit fixed-effects are included in the alternative
fully-dynamic specification (light blue). 95% confidence interval are presented. Standard errors clustered at
the city level.


Figure 1.4(a) documents a positive and significant effect of Broadband Internet on firm-bank
distance. The magnitude implies that connected banks match with firms that are located
in average 10% further, 5 years after the shock. Figure 1.4(a) shows that the result is not
significantly affected if one considers the average distance weighted by credit exposure. These
results are in line with Kroszner and Strahan (1999) point out that innovation in information
technology reduced the dependence on geographical proximity between customers and banks
in the US, starting in the 70s. This is also consistent to Petersen and Rajan (2002) that
documents the erosion of the local nature of small business lending, with increasing distance
between small firms and their lenders in the United States but also new communication
habits. Similar trends are observed in France: inter-regional credit flows have grown by 15%

and the average firm-bank distance has increased by 10% between 1998 and 2005. As far as I
know, this paper is the first to provide a causal interpretation for those facts, suggesting that
innovations in information technology – namely, Broadband Internet diffusion – reduced the
role of both transaction and search costs in shaping credit outcomes, allowing firms to search
for credit further and leading to structural changes in local credit markets. This suggests
that innovations in information technology reduced the role of both transaction and search
costs in shaping credit outcomes, allowing firms to search for credit further and leading to
structural changes in local credit markets.


7.     Implications for the cost of debt
In this last section, I use the empirical results from Section 6 to quantify the impact of
the technology-induced reduction in search frictions on loan prices through the lens of my
model. Mapping the model prediction (1.17) into the gravity equation I estimate gives the
following equivalence between the model parameters and the empirical estimates β1 = ν θ,
β2 = % and β3 = γ. Thus, the technology-induced reduction in search frictions κuv for a pair
of connected cities formally writes:

                                 ∆ lnκuv = γ̂ ∆ Cuv = −0.058                                                (1.27)

While Broadband Internet may affect all variables in this equation as the firm productivity
zev , the cost cu and the θ paramater of the bank branches’ size distribution, I keep them
constant to conduct counterfactual exercises. I finally plug into this equation my empirical
estimates for β1 = −νθ, F Eu and κuv (1) = γ as well as parameters calibrated from the data
(θ, distuv ) in order to compute ∆lnPˆev the change in the lower expected cost of debt trig-
gered by the BI-induced reduction in search frictions. My model predicts an average decline
of -4.9% in 2005, compared to what it would have been without any lowering of search and
contracting costs. This decline in the cost of debt would have been higher if all french cities
were connected at the end of 2005, with an average value of -5.8%. This results echoes the
conclusion of Hauswald and Marquez (2003) that shows how improved access to information
makes markets more competitive so that customers benefit from technological progress. The
mechanism herein departs from theirs as I focus on firm search and I do not model the
process by which banks search for customers (and information about those customers), but
the intuition of an easier dissemination of information is similar.


Figure 1.13 illustrates the spatial dimension of the decline in firms’ cost of debt. Dark blue
cities are the one in which this decline is the strongest (larger than the 75th percentile) while
the light grey ones indicates a reduction lower than the median. Figure 1.14 gives a similar
point of view with a focus on the Paris region. It is noteworthy that all the largest french
cities (Paris, Marseille, Bordeaux or Lyon) benefit less from this decline than suburban
or rural areas. This results is in line with the model intuition that a reduction in search
frictions precipitate an increase in competition due to the ability for firm to search further
and meet with more bank branches. In already crowded markets with a lot of active banks
and a high level of competition – typically in large city centers – firms were not highly
constrained by the search frictions and the decline is low. On the contrary, in isolated and

rural submarkets where firms had to make costly efforts to multiply meetings with different
bankers and eventually match with the right one, the reduction in search frictions triggers a
substantial decline in loan prices.


8.     Conclusion
I develop a new theory of firm-bank matching subject to search frictions. I provide a causal
evidence of such frictions affect firm-bank matching and the allocation of bank credit, using
the staggered roll-out of broadband internet in France as a shock on transaction and search
costs. I show that this technology-induced reduction in search frictions triggers an increase
by 6% of the share of credit exchanged between interconnected cities. This positive effect
varies with the initial level of search frictions: it is higher when two very distant cities are
connected. On the contrary, the effect the effect is almost null when two neighboring cities,
already economically very closely tied, are interconnected by internet. Leveraging bank
branch-level data, I document that Broadband Internet diffusion allows banks to match
with new firms located remotely. Connected banks increase their share of credit lent to firms
located outside their city by 10%, and their share of remote clients by almost 12%. As a
result, the average distance between a bank and its customers increases by 10% in the medium
run after broadband internet access. Finally, I plug these estimates into the equation linking
search frictions to loan prices. Interpreted within my model, the reduced-form estimates
imply that the reduction in search frictions due to the large diffusion of Broadband Internet
lowered the cost of debt for small businesses by 4.9% on average. Overall, this paper highlight
the role of transactions and search cost in shaping firm’s access to credit. Credit markets
with high search frictions make financing by bank credit both difficult, time-consuming
and onerous, especially for small businesses. This conclusion calls for a variety of economic
policies aiming at to make the process of searching and applying for credit more fluid, efficient
and less burdensome, in particular in a period of pandemic marked by the disappearance of
face-to-face interactions and the consequent surge of digitalization

Notes: This figure shows the roll-out of Broadband Internet for all city in mainland France, for the years
2001, 2003 and 2003. The dark blue areas represent a large degree of coverage (Zut close to 1), while the
light blue areas are city with no internet connection (Zut equal to 0). This unique data was collected by
Magouyres et al. (2019) and contain the date of upgrade to ADSL for each Local Exchange (LE)’s in mainland
France. The historical operator (France Télécom) had to make this data available to other operators as well
as websites allowing consumers to gauge the quality of their line for regulatory reasons. Additionally, the
authors gather data from the regulatory agency (ARCEP) regarding the geographical coverage of each LE.
Combining both datasets,they construct a continuous measure Zut described in Section 1.

Notes: This figure displays the log average credit size of a branch in its local submarket (”at home”) for
the group of branches that operate at least in k remote submarkets, with k on the x axis. Bank branches
are ranked and grouped based on the number of remote submarkets (i.e. urban units) where they operate:
all the branches lend at least to one submarket while none are active in all.

Notes: This figure shows the share of urban units that borrow and lend simultaneously to remote submarkets
(in blue). ALL indicates that all types of credit and all type of clients are included in the computation,
while ST stands for short-term credit, LT for long-term. GE indicates that urban units borrow and lend
simultaneously to large firms, MICRO to very small and PME to medium size firms. The red bars indicate
the share of urban units simultaneously borrow and lend to the same distant submarket, with similar sub-

Notes: This figure shows the rank correlation between optimal versus observed connection ranks. The
combination of exogenous connection gains and costs have a strong predictive power, with a R-square close
to 0.70. The optimal connection rank R̂i is predicted for each Local Exchange i, only taking into account two
presumably exogenous measures of costs (shortest distance to existing infrastructure) and gains (population
density).

Bank Local Specialization
This chapter is based on a paper co-authored with Anne Duquerroy (BdF), Jean-Stéphane
Mésonnier (BdF) and Daniel Paravisini (LSE, CEPR).

                                           Abstract
Using micro-data of the universe of bank-SME relationships in France, we show that
banks specialize locally (at the branch level) by industry, and that this specialization shapes
the equilibrium amount of borrowing by small firms. For identification, we exploit the
reallocation of local clients from closed down branches to nearby branches of the same
bank, which induced quasi-random variation in the match between a firm’s industry and the
industry of specialization of the lending branch. We show that branch reallocation leads, on
average, to a substantial and permanent decline in small firm borrowing. This decline is
twice larger for firms whose accounts are reallocated from branches less specialized in their
industry than the original one.

Introduction
           idespread bank branch closures and consolidation in Europe and the United

W           States after the Great Recession have renewed a longstanding policy and aca-
            demic debate about the nature and implications of bank market power. A vast
body of theoretical and empirical work, following Rajan (1992), has explored one source of
such market power: the informational monopoly gained through relationship lending. Less
studied, and of potentially equal importance, is the market power gained through differenti-
ation and specialization. Lenders that may appear to compete fiercely in an undifferentiated
credit market, may in fact enjoy market power in some market segments by tailoring their
products and services to particular clients, industries, or types of financing. Such credit

market segmentation may have first order implications for the access to credit by small and
opaque bank-dependent firms as well as its cost. Documenting the extent to which banks
specialize in a segmented small business credit market, and assessing whether specialization
confers market power, poses important data and identification challenges that we address in
this paper.

We use unique regulatory data that contains, for the universe of bank-firm relationships
in France, the identity and location of the bank branch providing credit. With these data
we construct measures of bank and bank-branch industry specialization in narrowly defined
geographical credit markets. Figure 2.1 provides stylized motivating evidence for our study.
It plots two different measures of credit market concentration by urban unit.1 The left panel
shows the standard concentration measure, calculated using total lending shares. The right
panel shows the average of credit concentrations calculated industry-by-industry, which takes
into account market segmentation. The difference between these two measures will be larger
when the credit market is segmented by industry (e.g., the two measures will be identical if
all bank loan portfolios have the same industry composition). Indeed, the fraction of urban
units with a very high concentration level (HHI > 0.4) raises from from 21% when measured
in the traditional manner, to 49% when measured taking into account credit segmentation
by industry (see Table 2.9 for more details). This pattern is consistent with heavy industry
segmentation in the small business bank credit market.

The main goal of our empirical analysis is to explore the implications of credit market
segmentation for small firms’ access to credit. Our working hypothesis is that a firm’s credit
elasticity of substitution across banks is smaller when specialized banks offer differentiated
services. For example, a firm in the construction industry will find more difficult or costly to
substitute credit obtained from the bank (or branch) that is specialized in the construction
industry than credit obtained from a generalist bank (or branch). A necessary first step is
to evaluate the relevant unit of analysis to study specialization. In other words, do banks
specialize by industry as a whole? Or is specialization a local, branch-level, phenomenon?

To answer this question we follow the data driven approach developed in Paravisini et al.
(2017) to identify banks’ sector of specialization using abnormally large portfolio shares. The
intuition of the measure is best explained through an example. Suppose 20% of bank credit
in an urban area goes to the construction industry and is serviced by five banks. Banks are
heterogeneous: while four banks allocate less than 10% of their loan portfolio to construction,
the fifth bank allocates more than 40% of its credit portfolio to the sector. This fifth bank
   1
    An urban unit is defined as a municipality or a group of municipalities which covers a continuously built
up zone (with no more than 200 meters between two constructions) and hosts at least 2,000 inhabitants.

would be identified as a specialist in the construction industry for this urban area. The
advantage of using portfolio shares to detect specialist banks is that the identification of the
specialization sector is unaffected by the size of the sector or by the market share of each
bank in any given location.

Two key stylized facts emerge from this exercise: bank branches tend to specialize by in-
dustry, but different branches of the same bank generally exhibit different industrial spe-
cializations. More than a third of bank branches in France come out as being specialized
in supplying credit to small firms in at least one specific broad industry. Most urban areas
include specialized bank branches. Moreover, we observe that most industries exhibit special-
ized bank branches at the local level. For instance, some 9% of the bank branches present in
our sample in 2017 are specialized in funding transportation and storage activities. Overall,
this implies that a French SME has a non-negligible probability to get connected to a branch
that is specialized in its type of business. When we investigate specialization patterns of the
branches within banks, we find that large banks are characterized by a large share of spe-
cialized branches (37% for the average bank with more than 10 branches). However, within
a bank, different branches tend to be specialized in different industries. In short, industry
specialization appears in the data as a widespread but local, branch-level, phenomenon.

Motivated by these stylized facts we turn to measuring the heterogeneity in firm’s elasticity
of credit substitution by branch specialization. Our empirical research design exploits bor-
rower reallocations across branches due to branch closures. Among bank branches active in
SME lending, some 700 branches were closed during our sample period (between 2010 and
2017) throughout the country, due to internal restructuring plans of the main banks’ retail
activities. Branch closures did not end bank-borrower relationships: all loan accounts in a
closing branch were transferred to larger nearby branches of the same bank. Branch reallo-
cation induced variation in the match between the borrower’s industry and the industry of
specialization of the branch that we exploit to measure the heterogeneity in the elasticity of
credit substitution. In the construction firm example above, when branch services are seg-
mented by industry, the transfer of the firm’s account to a generalist branch should reduce
the equilibrium amount of credit used by the firm, relative to a counterfactual in which the
account were transferred to another branch that is also specialized in the construction indus-
try. Branch closures occurred in large waves, and the identity of the closing and absorbing
branches were selected by headquarters according to criteria like local bank density, arguably
unrelated to the demand for credit of individual firms. The very disaggregated nature of the
data also allows using saturated specifications to control for local shocks at the urban unit
level, bank shocks, and firm shocks that may occur concurrently with the branch closure.

In the baseline specification we find evidence of a significant drop in the total of credit
granted by a bank to a small firm whenever the firm’s account is reallocated to a new
branch. Including undrawn credit lines, total credit drops by 12% on average over the three
years following the effective closing. Part of this decline is substituted with more credit
from other banks. However, the average firm’s total credit drops permanently by about 4%
after an account reallocation, relative to other firms in the same narrow geographical market
and industry. We then document the heterogeneity of this decline in equilibrium credit
by the match between the borrower’s industry and the industry of specialization of the
closing and absorbing branches. We find that the magnitude of the decline in credit doubles
when a firm’s accounts are reallocated from a branch that specializes in its industry to a
branch that does not. The magnitude of this estimated effect is robust to controlling for the
change in distance associated with the branch closing. In the cross section, we find that the
decline in credit following a branch closure is entirely explained by the variation in industry
specialization between branches when the new branch is located in an area characterized by
a high level of bank competition. The results are strongly suggestive of a segmented bank
credit market, where bank specialization by industry increases the cost of substituting bank
sources of financing for small firms.

Related Literature. The results in this paper complement an extensive literature on rela-
tionship lending to small firms (for surveys see, e.g., Boot (2000); Ongena and Smith (2000);
Degryse et al. (2009)). This literature analyzes the market power banks gain thanks to the
private information gathered through the lending interaction with small and opaque bor-
rowers.2 We extend this literature by characterizing the complementary role of the industry
segmentation of the small-firm credit market.

The results represent a novel contribution to the nascent literature studying the extent and
consequences of bank specialization in corporate lending. Studies that incorporate special-
ization and segmentation in the analysis of bank competition in the market for corporate
credit is scarce, a stark contrast to its widespread adoption in the study of consumer banking
services, such as mortgages (e.g., Benetton (2020)), pensions (e.g., Hastings et al. (2017)),
and deposits (e.g., Egan et al. (2017)), amongts others. Of the existing work on bank spe-
cialization, the closest to ours is Paravisini et al. (2017), which shows that lenders specialize
by export destination market in the context of Peruvian exporters.3 Our contribution to
   2
     See, for example, Sharpe (1990); Rajan (1992); Berger and Udell (1995, 2002); Agarwal and Hauswald
(2010); Ioannidou and Ongena (2010); Degryse and Ongena (2005); Drexler and Schoar (2014); Petersen and
Rajan (1994); Nguyen (2019))

     Two other recent studies that incidentally point to a potential role for banks’ industry specialization are
Ongena and Yu (2017), which finds that multi-industry firms tend to borrow from a larger number of banks,
and that they tend to pick up banks according to their industry specialization, and De Jonghe et al. (2019),

this work is twofold. First, we show that the effect on competition of market segmenta-
tion through differentiation is of first order magnitude for small opaque firms. And second,
we uncover and document the local and decentralized nature of specialization within large
banks.

These findings combined imply that the true extent of market power, segmentation, and
specialization in the bank credit market for small firms can be obscured by aggregate or
bank-level data. Also, the results have important implications for the consequences of bank
branch consolidation, which motivates this paper. The mechanism uncovered here is related
to, but economically distinct from, the role played by physical distance and emphasized by
existing work (e.g., Nguyen (2019)). In very related work, Bonfim et al. (2016) documents
that loan conditions change when firms switch to a new bank following to closure. Our results
highlight that branch closures affect the credit relationship even when borrowers remain with
the same lender, through changes in local competition.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the spread of French
banking networks and institutional details about branch closures. Section 2 describes the
data used in our analysis. In Section 3, we present our measure of bank branch specialization
and provide descriptive statistics of this new variable. Section 4 describes our empirical
strategy and section 5 details the results of our analysis. Last, Section 6 concludes.


1.      Bank branch networks in France
France has one of the most developed network of bank branches in the euro area. Bank
branches are geographically widespread throughout the country, leaving almost no room for
so-called banking deserts, even though the largest urban areas concentrate a larger number of
bank branches. As an illustration, the left panel of Figure 2.2 shows the spatial distribution of
branches lending to SMEs as of December 2016. However, in the past couple of years, major
French banks have announced plans to reduce their branch network by 2020 as customers
are walking into their bank less often than before. These plans confirm and accelerate a
trend that started with the financial crisis in the previous decade, against the backdrop of
a concomitant rise of online banking. In aggregate, the overall number of bank branches,
lending to both households and firms in France, has declined by 4%, from 38,784 branches
which finds that Belgian banks hit by the Lehman shock tend to shore up borrowers in industries where
the bank is dominant and industries where it is specialized. In addition, Goedde-Menke and Ingermann
(2020) find that lower specialization - defined as a higher diversification of loan officers’ portfolio - following
a downsizing in the bank staff of a German bank, translates into higher risk taking in the intensive margin.

Among these branches, some only lend to corporate clients, some only serve households and
others serve both. In this paper, we focus on branches that distribute credit to small and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs).5 At the end of 2016, about a third of all bank branches
(12,291 branches) were actively lending to SMEs 6 . Among the branch closings registered
since 2010, some two thirds happened as the consequence of a merger between two banks. We
focus here on the remaining closings, that were not related to bank mergers, so that the post-
closing transfer of firm accounts remains always confined within the same initial relationship
bank. From 2010 Q1 to 2017 Q3, some 700 branches that were active in local SME lending
closed in continental France as a result of internal bank strategies.7 These closings have
been widespread over time and geographically dispersed as illustrated by figures 2.3 and 2.4.
Figure 2.3 shows the spatial distribution of all branch closings over the 2010-2017 period.
Over our sample period 45% of branch closings took place in small cities (urban units with
less than 20,000 inhabitants) and 15% in large cities (more than 100,000 inhabitants).

In practice, when a bank decides to close a branch, the closing announcement takes place 14
to 17 months before the branch officially closes and actually stops operating. Following the
closing of the branch where their account is managed, borrowers do not lose access to their
bank: they are automatically transferred to another branch within the same bank. They do
not get to choose their new branch in the vast majority of cases. On average 90% of firms in
our sample get transferred to the absorbing branch while the rest of them may have made
their own decision to switch to another entity.

In our analysis of the effects of local bank specialization, we exploit branch closings as events
which trigger exogenous variation in the industry specialization of the bank branches to which
a given firm is connected. For our identification strategy to be valid, it is therefore important
to ensure that branch closings are not on average a consequence of a lower credit quality of
the branch’s local borrowers. If this were the case, any reduction in credit received by a firm

      We define firm size according to the European definition. SMEs are enterprises with less than 250
workers and a turnover or total assets not exceeding, respectively, 50 million euros and 43 million euros.
    6
      This number is based on lending to SMEs - excluding micro-firms and individual entrepreneurs - recorded
in the French Central Credit Register (see data section for more details).
    7
      Information about closed branches is consistently registered over time for most French banks but not for
all of them. The bank needs to follow a permanent account number policy (so called RIB ) for panel data
information to be available about the demography of its branches. The historical information about the
extent of a bank’s network that is stored by the Banque de France is limited to 14 months unless the bank
has opted for a specific account registration framework called “RIB permanent” (permanent bank account
identifier), henceforth RIB-p banks. Our sample of branch closings events is thus restricted to such banks for
the period 2010- 2014 and exhaustive starting in 2015 as we have started to collect and record information
on branch closings on a regular basis at the beginning of 2016.

following the transfer to a new branch could reveal its lower quality, which would eventually
be uncovered by the loan officers of the new branch, rather that a drop in credit supply by
the bank. We therefore need to ascertain that closures are not merely the consequences of
adverse local economic conditions weighing down on local borrowers.

Unfortunately, banks do not disclose the precise criteria they apply when deciding which
branches have to close. When they communicate upon the topic, e.g., in their annual reports,
banks generally motivate the downsizing of their branch network by general developments
such as the rise of online banking, and do not refer to local conditions. To gather more
direct evidence that closing decisions are independent enough of local economic conditions,
we therefore conduct a few preliminary tests.

We first run a standard analysis of variance, whereby we regress a dummy for branch closures
(over the period 2010-2017) on various sets of fixed effects. Spatial dummies standing for
counties (in French: départements) and (much smaller) urban units explain respectively 3%
and 8% of the variance of the branch closing dummy.8 Banking group fixed effects also acount
for only a tiny share of variance. In contrast, the bank-level fixed effects explain alone 32%.
Overall, this suggests that the decision to close a branch depends more on banks’ global
strategy rather than on local factors.

Second, we estimate a linear probability model that relates the probability that a branch
closes to a set of (i) branch-level variables and (ii) measures of local economic dynamics. The
dependent variable is again a dummy equals to 1 if the branch is closed during the 2010-2017
period. Explanatory variables, measured before the period of interest, are the size of the
branch (total amount of corporate loans, in log), the branch’s market share in the county, a
dummy for being the only local branch of the bank, the rank of the branch within the bank
(of within the bank × county) and the county’s size and population dynamics (measured
as the increase in the number of inhabitants over the period 1990-2006).9 We find that the
probability of a closing decreases when the branch is the sole branch of its bank in the county
and increases when the county is more populated and its population is on the rise. These
results are consistent with anecdotal evidence in the press that banks close more branches in
dynamic cities where the population is younger and keener on using online banking. Branch
characteristics, as the branch’s market size or its relative size within the bank (its rank),
seem not to impinge on the decision to close it. Interestingly, the significance of branch-level
variables vanishes whenever we add bank fixed effects in the regression. The low predictive
power of these branch-specific variables conditionally on bank fixed-effects provide support

to our identification strategy.


2.      Data

2.1.    Data sources
We merge three different types of information to conduct our empirical analysis: bank-firm
credit exposures, bank branch opening and closing dates and geographical data on French
municipalities, urban units and urban areas.

First, we get virtually all credit links between domestic bank branches and non-financial
firms in France from the French credit register, which records bilateral credit exposures at
the branch-firm level above a small reporting threshold of EUR 25,000.10 A firm is defined
here as a registered legal entity. Each firm is identified with a unique legal identifier (SIREN
code). A credit exposure towards a borrower is defined as the total of loans, undisbursed
credit lines and guarantees given by the bank branch.11 Some detail is also reported about
the outstanding amounts of specific types of loans (notably, leasing, factoring and securitized
loans). This information is collected at monthly frequency. To limit the size of our database,
we however keep end-of-quarter observations only. Banks are individual credit institutions
that have been authorized to operate in France (including branches of foreign banks). They
are identified by a 5-digit code (BIC code) and can be part of a banking group. We map
banks into their respective consolidating groups (Groupes economiques d’appartenance, or
GEA) using additional information from the French supervisor. The credit register also
includes the ZIP codes of both the borrowing firms and the bank branches, which allows us
to compute geopgraphical distances between borrowers and lenders.

Second, data on branch closures are obtained from the Banque de France FIB database
(Fichier des Implantations Bancaires) since 2010. This database collects information on
every single bank branch operating in France, including its precise location (ZIP code/street
address), its opening date and the BIC number of the parent bank. As regards branch clo-
sures, the database records the official date of the closing, the date of the closing announce-
ment, as well as the reason why a branch was closed (merger or acquisition by another bank
  10
     The threshold applied at the branch-firm level up to March 2012, and at the (less restrictive) bank-firm
level thereafter. We imposed this threshold at the branch-firm level throughout the 2010-2017 period to
avoid a statistical break.
  11
     Two banks, La Banque Postale (the French post bank) and another French cooperative bank, only report
their bilateral credit exposures at the county (departement) level, and not at the level of local branches. We
drop these two banks from our sample. They accounted for less than 1% of outstanding amounts of loans to
SMEs in December 2016.

or internal bank reorganization). In the case of a within-bank closing and a subsequent
transfer of accounts, the identity of the absorbing branch, as well as its location, are re-
ported. For our purpose, a firm is affected by the closing of bank branch (treatment) if this
firm had a lending relationship with the closing branch in the 12-month period before the
official closing date. We drop firms affected by more than one closing event (less than 10%
of treated firms).

Last, we gather geographical data for mainland France about some 36.000 municipalities
(identified with a ZIP code), 2,000 urban units and 771 urban areas. A urban unit (UU) is a
municipality (commune) or a group of municipalities that includes on its territory a built-up
area of at least 2,000 inhabitants where no dwelling is separated from the nearest one by more
than 200 meters. In addition, each municipality has more than half of its population living in
this built-up area. The largest geographical unit that we consider in this paper is the urban
area (UA). A urban area is defined as a group of municipalities, all in one piece and without
enclaves, consisting of a urban pole with more than 10,000 jobs, and rural municipalities
or urban units (peri-urban crown) where at least 40% of the resident population with a job
works in the pole or in municipalities attracted by it.12 We compute firm-branch distances
with reference to the centroid of the municipalities they are located in. In contrast, we use
urban units and urban areas in order to control for geographical dynamics at a broader and
more economically relevant level in our empirical analysis.


2.2.    Data cleaning
We aim to analyze credit relationships between small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs)
and the local branches of their relationship banks. The French credit register contains a lot
of information that is not relevant for our purpose and it therefore deserves some cleaning.

As far as banks are concerned, we drop all banks for which leasing activities represent
more than 95% of their total exposure over the decade 2007-2017. Leasing is a non-standard
lending activity that requires specific knowledge and expertise. This specific financial service
is most often provided by specialized institutions (in general subsidiaries of larger banking
groups) that operate remotely, mostly from Paris. Even though the contract with the leasing
company may be sold by the local branch of a deposit-taking bank that belongs to the same
group, the issuing branch is recorded in the credit register as being the branch of the leasing
institution and not the local bank branch that only acts here as an intermediary. As we aim
to study local bank-firm relationships, these leasing institutions do not enter into the scope
  12
    The urban zoning also distinguishes ”medium areas”, a group of municipalities consisting of a pole with
5,000 to 10,000 jobs and ”small areas”, a group of municipalities consisting of a pole with 1,500 to 5,000 jobs

of this analysis. Additionally, we drop all French public financial institutions (e.g. Groupe
CDC, Caisse nationale des autoroutes, BPIFrance etc.). Last, we exclude bank branches
located in Corsica and in the French overseas territories (DOM-COM ). Individual banks are
mapped into their respective banking groups (so-called Groupes Economies d’Appartenance)
using additional information provided by the French supervisor (ACPR).

As far as borrowers are concerned, we first exclude sole-entrepreneurships so as to focus on
corporations. We drop firms that belong to the financial sector, local public administrations,
non-resident firms, as well as real estate companies (SCI ).13 We consider in our final sample
only legal entities belonging to small and medium-sized corporations (SMEs) as defined by
the French LME Act of 2008, i.e. firms with less than 250 employees and a turnover below
EUR 50 mns (or total assets below 43 mns).14 However, we exclude micro-enterprises (firms
with less than 10 employees and an annual turnover below EUR 2 mns) in order to keep
the size of our sample manageable. We also drop firms with missing size classification. We
focus on firms with at least two banking relationships. Last, we only keep firms that are
located in urban units where at least one branch closing occurs and are present at least 8
quarters in a row (2 years) in the credit register.15 We further impose that treated firms
borrow funds from the closing bank branch during at least one quarter in the year preceding
the announcement of the closure (quarter ”-11” to quarter ”-7”).


2.3.    Descriptive statistics
We conduct our baseline empirical analysis using credit exposure data aggregated at the
firm-bank level, while keeping a record of bank branch closures that affect each bilateral
relationship in order to construct our treatment variable. Table 2.1 provides detailed statis-
tics of our firm-bank dataset. Our estimating sample consists in more than 5.2 millions
firm-bank relationships, over the period 2010 Q1 to 2017 Q3. We observe on average 346
banks, corresponding to 11,786 bank branches, and 77,640 firms per quarter. The average
number of firm-bank relationships in the cross-section is close to 190,000. The average credit
relationship involves an outstanding loan amount of some EUR 430,000 (some EUR 530,000
when undrawn credit lines are taken into account), but half of the bilateral bank-firm rela-
tionships involve much smaller amounts, below EUR 115,000. The table also confirms that
  13
      We likewise delete observations for various legal categories under the French civil, commercial or admin-
istrative law that are irrelevant for our analysis (eg. parishes, unions, some types of cooperatives, etc.).
   14
      The legal definition of an enterprise is the smallest grouping of legal entities that makes up a coherent
production unit of goods or services and enjoys some minimal degree of management autonomy.
   15
      This means that the total of all loans (including short and long term credit, credit-lines, overdrafts,
account receivables, export credit, and leasing and factoring) and bank guarantees received by the firm from
all selected banks is non-zero during a period of at least to years.

SMEs tend to pick up lenders in a relatively small neighborhood: the median of the distance
between a SME and its bank in our dataset is only 14 km.16 In Table 2.2, we also show
firm-level statistics for our sample of multi-bank SMEs. The outstanding bank debt of the
average firm is EUR 1 million, which confirms that most of the firms in our sample are rather
small. The average total amount of credit granted to a firm, including undrawn credit lines,
is slightly larger (EUR 1.2 million) and the average ratio of long-term credit to drawn credit
is 50% (where long-term credit refers to credit with initial maturity over one year).


3.      Measuring local bank specialization

3.1.     Measuring local bank specialization
In this section, we detail how we define and compute local bank specialization and provide
some descriptive statistics of this new variable. We are interested in this study in the indus-
trial specialization of bank branches. Our definition of specialization relates to Paravisini
et al. (2017), although we define here specialization at the level of bank branches instead of
banks and we consider specialization vis-à-vis local borrowers in a specific industry instead
of exporters to a given country. Note that, in order to assess the local industry specialization
of bank branches, we use information about all bank branches lending to non-financial firms
in continental France between 2010 and 2017 and measure their lending activity towards all
domestic non-financial firms (including large firms).17

We proceed in four steps. We first define the credit concentration of branch h of bank b in
an industrial sector s as the ratio of credit supplied by branch h to firms in s over the total
amount of credit supplied by branch h to firms in all sectors:

                                                              P
                                                                   i∈(b,h,s)   Li
                                  Concentrationb,h,s = P0 P                                                 (2.1)
                                                               s     i∈(b,h,s0 ) Li


where Li denotes the amount of credit lent by h to a firm i.

Second, the credit concentration of h in s needs to be compared with a relevant local bench-
  16
      The distance to the bank is computed as the unweighted average of the distances to all the banks’
branches the firm borrows from.
   17
      This information set is therefore larger than the sample of bank branches and firms used in the regressions.
in practice, we restrict the population to branches located in urban areas with more than 10 branches -which
is almost always the case- and branches with more than 5 customer firms. Increasing this threshold to a
minimum of 10 borrowers slightly increases the number of branches for which we can compute a specialization
indicator but does not affect our results.



                                                      123


mark. For this purpose, we aggregate the loan portfolios of all bank branches located in the
same urban area u as h. We then define the benchmark concentration of loans to sector s in
the neighborhood of h as the share of s in the credit supplied by bank branches located in
u (including h). The relative local credit concentration of branch h in sector s then reads:


                        Ŝb,h,s,u = Concentrationb,h,s − Concentrationu,s                     (2.2)

This measure lies in the ]-1;1[ interval. A relative credit concentration in s equal to zero
means that share of s in h’s credit portfolio is aligned with the composition of lending in the
neighborhood, possibly reflecting either a strong presence or the absence of s-type firms in
this neighborhood. In contrast, a value close to 1 indicates that branch h almost exclusively
funds industry s, while other banks in the neighborhood do not. In that sense, h is specialized
locally in financing industry s.

Third, we follow on Paravisini et al. (2017) and focus on outlier values of Ŝb,h,s,u . More
precisely, a branch is identified as being specialized in industry s (i.e., the specialization
dummy Sb,h,s,u is set to one) if Ŝb,h,s,u is above the upper extreme value, defined by the 75-th
percentile plus 1.5 inter-quartile ranges, of the distribution of Ŝb,h,s,u across all bank branches
operating in continental France in quarter q:


                       Sb,h,s,u = I(Ŝb,h,s,u ≥ p75 + 1, 5 · IQR(F (Ŝb,h,s,u )))             (2.3)

where F(Ŝb,h,s,u ) is the distribution of relative lending intensity of all branches located in
urban area u. As highlighted in Paravisini et al. (2017), identifying outliers using percentiles
and inter-quartile ranges has the advantage that it does not rely on any assumptions about
the distribution of bank portfolio shares.

Fourth, when a branch h is closed and all its clients are reallocated to branch h0 , these firms
face an exogenous change in the industrial specialization of their relationship lender. For
each firm i, this matters only as far as either h or h0 are specialized in the industry of i.
We then define a firm-specific relative loss in the industry specialization due to a branch
reallocation:


                                  ∆Sb,i,u = Sb,h,s(i),u − Sb,h0 ,s(i),u

If both branches share the same level of specialization in the industry to which i belongs,


                                                  124


denoted s(i), then ∆Sb,i,u equals zero and i is not affected. If the closing branch is specialized
in s(i) and the absorbing one is not, then ∆Sb,i,u equals one and firm i is likely to face higher
informational frictions in its access to credit because the new loans officers in branch h0 are
less skilled in monitoring firms in this specific industry.

In practice, we define industries at the one-digit level of the NACE rev2 classification (refered
to using letters from A to S). We therefore measure bank branch specialization in terms
of 15 broadly defined sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and fishing (A), mining (B),
manufacturing (C), construction (F), wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles
and motorcycles (G), accommodation and food service activities (I) or administrative and
support service activities (N). We smooth out some noisy variations due to the small size
of some branches and neighborhoods by computing ∆Sb,h,h0 ,s,u as the average specialization
of the closing branch the year before the closure minus the specialization of the new branch
one quarter before the closure.18


3.2.      Stylized facts about local bank specialization
In this section, we provide a first description of the industrial specialization of bank branches
in France in the 2010s. First, we find that the local industrial specialization of bank branches
is a rather common phenomenon. Some 36% of bank branches lending to firms are specialized
in lending to at least one industry at some point in time. Moreover, specialized bank branches
are not clustered in some region but roughly equally spread across the whole country, as the
second panel of Figure 2.2 shows. Specialized branches are present in some 90% of urban
units where bank branches lending to firms are located, although they are more numerous in
larger cities hosting a larger number of branches. On average over 2010-2017, the probability
that a firm is borrowing from a bank branch that is specialized in financing its industry is
close to 30%.

Second, we observe that most (broadly defined) industries benefit from the presence of locally
specialized bank branches. Figure 2.5 shows the number of specialized bank branches per
industry as of September 2017, to be compared to the some 12,000 bank branches in our
sample at this date. Some 900 branches come out as being specialized in lending to the
transportation and storage sector [H]. About 750 and 700 branches are specialized in lending
to firms which operate in the information and communication sector [J] and, respectively, in
the construction sector [F]. In contrast, almost no branches are specialized in funding firms
selling other services activities [S] or manufacturing firms [C].
 18
      The lags also warrant that branch-level specialization measures are not affected by the closure.



                                                      125


The upper panel of Table 2.3 provides a view on branch specialization from the perspective
of individual banks as of September 2017. The 294 banks in our sample have between one
and 1,152 branches in mainland France. On average, a bank has a network of 35 branches, a
dozen of which are specialized. However, these distributions are skewed by the large number
of small banks, as the median bank only has one branch in this sample. To get a more
informative picture of the situation of so-called ”network” banks, which run retail banking
operations through a network of local branches and make up the bulk of credit supply to
firms, the lower panel of the same table shows the same statistics when we focus on the
sub-sample of the 81 banks with at least 10 branches. The average network bank has some
120 branches lending to non-financial firms, while 37% of these branches are specialized in
supplying credit to at least one industry.

Finally, we ask whether specialized branches within a bank tend to be all specialized in the
same industry, which would suggest that the coutrywide specialization pattern of the banks
prevails over what we would mistakenly view as local specialization patterns. To get a sense
of this, we first compute within each urban unit the share of specialized bank branches which
do not share the same industry specialization locally as their parent bank coutrywide (e.g.,
a branch specialized in funding transportation firms which belongs to a bank specialized in
funding manufacturing industries fits in this category). Figure 2.6 shows convincingly that
local bank branch specialization is largely disconnected from the whole bank’s specialization.
In the most populated areas, such as the largest urban centers or the French Riviera, the
majority of specialized branches are indeed not aligned with the specialization of their parent
bank.

Second, we compute for each bank the Hirschman-Herfindahl index of its number of special-
ized branches in each of the fifteen industries. Conceptually, the index takes the value of one
whenever all the bank’s specialized branches are specialized in the same industry. Conversely,
the index takes a value close to zero (the inverse of the number of local branches) whenever
each of its branches is specialized in a different industry. We then look at the distribution
of this index across banks. Results are shown on the last line of each panel in Table 2.3. We
find that this HHI index is low on average (0.15), with a value of 0.1 for more than 75%s
of larger, “network” banks. This confirms that, within-bank, branch specialization is barely
concentrated in a few industries only.

4.     Empirical strategy

4.1.   Branch closures and credit supply: firm-bank level analysis
We first aim to identify the loan supply pattern of banks to existing corporate clients around
the closing date of bank branches serving these customers. For this purpose, we estimate
the change in credit experienced by firm i that borrows from a bank b when the firm is
being transferred from a closing branch h to an absorbing branch h0 within bank b. We
aggregate granular firm-branch credit exposures at the firm-bank level and estimate the
following empirical model :



             Log(Loan)ibt = β0 I{Announcement}ib,T −6≤t≤T + β1 I{Closing}ib,t≥T             (2.4)
                           + Firm x Bank FE + Firm x Quarter FE
                           + Banking group x Quarter FE + ijt


where i denotes a firm, b denotes a bank and t = T is the quarter of closing. The dependent
variable Loanibt measures the euro amount of total debt outstanding between firm i and bank
b’s branch(es) in quarter t. The indicator variable I{Announcement}b,T −6≤t≤T is set to one
during the transition period that follows the announcement of the closing, six quarters before
the branch is definitively closed. The indicator variable I{closing}b,t≥T takes the value of
one after date t = T when the branch of b that used to lend to i definitively closes (meaning
that firm i had a positive credit exposure with the closed branch at least one quarter during
the 12 quarters that precede the official closing).

We estimate (2.4) over the period from Q1 2010 to Q3 2017. Our main coefficient of interest
is β1 which captures to what extent banks that experienced a branch closing modify their
loan supply when borrowers are reallocated between branches. As said above, we restrict
the sample to firms located in urban units where at least one bank branch closed over the
sample period. This restriction is intended to both limit discrepancies between geographical
areas that are treated by branch closures and geographical areas that are not and to reduce
the imbalance in terms of size between of our treatment and control groups.


In estimating (2.4), we face to identification issues. The first one is a possible endogeneity
of the bank’s choice to close a branch to the condition of local borrowers: a closing may
take place in a given area because, e.g., of the lackluster profitability of loans to local firms,

                                               127


reflecting a decline in economic activity in this neighborhood. We address this concern by
including firm-bank fixed effects that control for time-invariant characteristics linked to the
respective firm-bank match.

Second, we also face the standard challenge of disentangling demand and supply of credit.
For this purpose, we include firm-time fixed effects in our regression, which absorb all possible
shocks to firms’ demand and credit quality, in the spirit of Khwaja and Mian (2008) and
many others. This implies that we consider only firms that borrow from at least two banks.
We therefore identify the effect of bank branch closures ”within” the borrowing firm, i.e.,
we compare credit amounts borrowed by the same firm in a given quarter from two different
banks (typically one that closes its local branch and one that does not), before and after
the branch closing that affects one of the credit relationships maintained by the firm. Last,
note that we also include banking group-quarter fixed effects among the regressors in (2.4) in
order to control for shocks at the more aggregate banking-group level that may also govern
local lending decisions.


4.2.   Branch closures and credit supply: firm-level analysis
In a second step, we check whether a firm is able to compensate for the negative credit shock
that may be associated with a branch reallocation within one of its lenders. For this purpose,
we collapse our database at the firm level and estimate the following model:



              Log(Loan)it = β0 I{Announcement}i,T −6≤t≤T + β1 I{closing}i,t≥T               (2.5)
                           + Firm FE + Industry x quarter FE
                           + Banking group x Urban unit x quarter FE + it


where i stands for the firm. Now, the dummy variable I{Closing}t≥k takes the value of
one whenever the firm faces the closing of one of its relationship bank branches. Again, we
control for unobserved characteristics of the firms, as well as for demand shocks and time
varying local factors at the industry level and geographical location level, as well as for other
unspecified bank-level shocks, by saturating the model with appropriate sets of fixed effects.


4.3.   Branch closures and change in the industry specialization of the bank
Last, we investigate whether and to what extent local bank specialization contributes to
explaining the effect of a branch reallocation on the supply of credit to the bank’s customers.

                                              128


We test for the role of the local specialization of bank branches by estimating an augmented
version of the previous empirical model (2.4):



             Log(Loan)ibt = β0 I{Announcement}ib,T −6≤t≤T + β1 I{Closing}ib,t≥T           (2.6)
                          + β2 ∆Sb,i,u I{Announcement}ib,T −6≤t≤T
                          + β3 ∆Sb,i,u I{Closing}ib,t≥T
                          + β4 Sb,i,u
                          + Firm x Bank FE + Firm x Quarter FE
                          + Banking group x Quarter FE + ijt


where ∆Sb,i,u measures the relative loss in firm-specific branch specialization when the firm i
is reallocated from the closed branch h to another branch h0 of the same bank b. For instance,
∆Sb,i,u takes the value of +1 whenever the closed branch was specialized in lending to the
firm’s industry s(i), whereas the new branch is not. We then control for the initial level of
borrower-specific industrial specialization of the closed branch and saturate the model with
fixed effects in order to control for firm-bank matching and for changes in credit demand.

As above, we are interested in evaluating whether the average small firm is able to compensate
for the negative impact of the bank specialization loss it is subjected to by borrowing more
from other lenders. We therefore run a similar regression after having collapsed the data at
the firm level:



              Log(Loan)it = β0 I{Announcement}i,T −6≤t≤T + β1 I{Closing}i,t≥T             (2.7)
                           + β2 ∆Si,u I{Announcement}i,T −6≤t≤T
                           + β3 ∆Si,u I{Closing}i,t≥T
                           + β4 Si,u
                           + Firm FE + Industry x quarter FE
                           + Banking group x Urban unit x quarter FE + it


where ∆Si,u denotes the bank specialization loss faced by firm i because of a branch reallo-
cation within one of its banks at time T .

5.     Results

5.1.   Branch reallocation and credit supply at the firm-bank level
Table 2.4 shows our results when we estimate the effect of a branch closing on credit at the
firm-bank level, as specified in equation (2.4). We find that, within their bank, firms that are
reallocated to a new branch after a branch closing face a sizeable reduction in credit supply.
A proper identification of this negative supply shock may be hampered if the decision to close
the branch is correlated with other factors potentially also affecting the new branch, such
as local economic conditions, the average credit quality of borrowers, regulatory constraints
etc. To address such concerns, in columns 1 to 4 of Table 2.4, we progressively saturate our
model with an extensive set of fixed effects.


First, in column (1), thanks to the inclusion of bank-firm fixed effect among regressors,
we account for potential differences in borrower-lender pairs, e.g. weak banks matching
with weak borrowers. This implies that our effect is estimated within an existing bank-firm
relationship (intensive margin), and does not capture the creation or destruction of bank-firm
relationships (extensive margin). Next, in column (2), we control for firm-level demand (or
credit quality) shocks by including firm-quarter fixed effects. We then add banking group-
quarter fixed effects to account for fluctuations in credit supply that would be driven by
shocks at the group level (such as regulatory shocks on the level of required capital. Last, we
control for variations of banking groups’ credit supply at the local level (such as a strategic
decision to divest from some areas) by including banking group-urban unit-quarter dummies.

Whatever the set of fixed effects used as controls, we find robust evidence of a significant
drop in the amount of credit supplied to a reallocated firm. The credit contraction is already
significant during the transition period after the branch closing announcement but before
the effective closing and transfer of the firm’s account. The magnitude of the contraction in
credit supplied is however twice as large after the reallocation. This contraction is economi-
cally significant: the amount of total credit made available to the firm (including undrawn
credit lines) drops by some 12% due to the branch reallocation. For the average firm-bank
relationship in our sample, this amounts to a cut by some 60, 000 euros.

In the last two columns of the table, we provide complementary results on the impact of a
branch reallocation on the credit mix supplied to the firm and the distance between borrower
and lender. Column (5) shows that the ratio of long-term credit over total credit (drawn and
undrawn) is not significantly affected by the reallocation. This suggests that firms facing a


                                              130


branch closing do not draw more on credit lines thereafter. Column (6) confirms the intuition
that a branch reallocation increases the average distance between a borrower and its bank.
The estimated coefficient corresponds to a doubling firm-bank distance for reallocated firms.

Last, we take a closer look at how the identified effect unfolds over time. Figure 2.7 shows
the estimation results of a dynamic version of equation 2.4, where we interact the closing
indicator with dummies for each quarter instead of a unique ex-post period.19 Credit supply
starts to drop around closing announcement. After the closing, the contraction in lending is
quite persistent and holds out over at least three years. The result is consistent with Nguyen
(2019) who shows that, following a merger, branch closures lead to a decline in local small
business lending that persists during up to six years. Importantly for identification, the
figure also shows that the usual parallel trend assumption is vindicated before the closing
announcement.


5.2.    Can multi-bank firms compensate for the effect of a branch reallocation?
Table 2.5 shows estimation results for equation (2.5), when the bank-firm data is collapsed
at the firm level. Note that we use here the same sample of firms as in the analysis above.
We find that the average small firm borrowing from at least two banks is only partly able
to compensate for the decline in credit that follows a branch reallocation within one of its
banks. More precisely, the branch reallocation seems to have no effect on the total supply of
credit to the firm during the transition period, while the ratio of long-term drawn lending to
total credit slightly decreases. This suggests that the firm may be able to negotiate in the
short run an increase of its credit lines with the other lenders. However, once the branch
closing is effective, the average small firm still faces a contraction by some 4% of the total
of its bank borrowings.

Last, figure 2.8 shows the estimated coefficients of interest in a dynamic version of (2.5).
The total amount of credit borrowed by a treated firm reaches a trough after two years.
The contraction in the firm’s access to credit is still significant three years after a branch
reallocation.


5.3.    The benefits of the local industry specialization of banks
We now turn to estimating equations (2.6) and (2.7), so as to highlight how the local industry
specialization of banks shapes bank lending to small firms. First, table 2.6 presents the results
  19
    In the figure, we take as a reference period the quarter two years-ahead of the effective closing (i.e.,
the corresponding interacted dummy is excluded from the regressors). Results are unchanged if we take the
whole pre-announcement period as a reference.


                                                   131


of regression (2.6) using firm-bank data. Columns (2) to (4) show robust evidence that the
drop in credit supply associated with a branch reallocation is strongly amplified when the firm
looses the benefit of being connected to a bank branch that was specialized in its industry.
Small firms that are matched to a specialized branch receive on average between 6% and 10%
more credit on a regular basis. When a branch reallocation entails a bank specialization loss,
the contraction in credit supply is roughly twice as large as otherwise (with a coefficient for
the interacted term pointing to a cut in outstanding amounts by between -9% and -13%). As
shown in column (5), the effect is not symmetric: borrowers that end up being matched to
a branch with relevant specialization remain negatively affected by the branch reallocation
in spite of the gain in terms of skills of the lender. Table 2.7 presents additional results at
the firm level (cf. equation 2.7). We find again that a firm which looses access to a branch
with the relevant industry specialization within one bank cannot fully compensate for the
lower provision of credit by borrowing more from its other lenders. The aggregate effect is
however less significant than the effect we observe within the reallocating bank alone.

The impact of branch closures on credit supply to SMEs may also go through other channels
which may be correlated with changes in industry specialization. We therefore check for the
robustness of our findings to the inclusion of additional interaction terms in regression (2.6).
Table 2.8 shows our results. First, we find that the effect of the loss in bank specialization
is not wiped out by the concomitant increase in bank-firm distance due to the branch re-
allocation. Specifically, we interact in column (2) our closing dummy closing × post with
an indicator variable ∆distance which equals 1 (resp. -1) if the closing entails an increase
(resp. a decrease) in the firm-bank distance larger than 20 kilometers, i.e. twice the median
of the firm-branch distance in our whole sample. We observe that the increased distance
does not seem to matter much (the coefficient is negative as expected but non significant).
Accordingly, the specialization coefficient does not bulge.

Second, we test whether the coefficient for the loss in bank specialization captures the possi-
ble confounding effect of a decrease in local lending concentration associated with the branch
reallocation. In column (3), we interact the closing event with a dummy variable equals to
one if local bank competition (measured in the urban unit of the absorbing branch) is lower
than the median competition. The coefficient is negative and significant (-0.09), which sug-
gests that entering an environment of weak bank competition worsens the effect of branch
reallocation. However, controlling for changes in competition in the local credit market due
to the transfer does not wipe out the effect of the specialization loss per se.


Last, we further investigate the role of local bank competition in shaping the response of

                                              132


SME lending to branch closures. For this purpose, we divide our sample of closing events into
two groups: closures with an absorbing branch that is located in a low-competition urban
unit, in column (5) versus located in a high-competition urban unit, in column (6). In an
environment of low competition, a branch closing hits homogeneously all transferred firms,
whatever the degree of specialization of the closed branch. A rationale for this could be
that less effort is required from the bank in the new environment for keeping the customer
and reaping the rents associated with prior information extraction. On the contrary, branch
specialization and the associated loss in industry-specific knowledge following to a closing
matters in a highly competitive banking environment: the coefficient for the closing per se is
not significant anymore, except for firms that additionally are subjected to a bank special-
ization loss. This suggests that the reduced supply of credit is then merely a consequence of
the loss in loan officers’ skills required to accommodate the credit needs of these customers.
In the standard case however, a high competitive pressure is enough to ensure continuity in
the level of credit supplied by the reallocating bank to small firms.


6.    Conclusion
In this paper, we provide evidence that a large share of local bank branches in France are
specialized in lending to some industries. We also show that this local bank specialization
matters for SMEs’ access to credit: a small firm enjoys on average a better access to bank
credit when the local branch of its relationship bank has gained a better knowledge of the
industry to which the firm belongs. Using a very rich dataset on bank branch closures over
2010-2017, we find that closures on average entail a substantial and persistent loss in credit
supplied for the local customers which are transferred to another branch. Importantly how-
ever, firms which, as a consequence, lose access to loan officers specialized in their industry
are more badly hit than others. This effect is not wiped out when considering confounding
factors such as the increased distance or the decreased local bank competition that may be
associated with the transfer.


Our findings have possibly important policy implications. First, competition regulators over-
seeing cuts in bank branch networks following bank mergers should be aware that local bank
specialization exists and matters for credit supply to SMEs. Concerns may arise if simple
competition rules, such as the obligation to close one of two branches in a given area, are
implemented bluntly. Second, supervisors and bank managers should be aware that closing
specialized branches may have differentiated effects on small borrowers, depending on their


                                             133


industry.


Many issues remain however open, and left for further research. A first, looming question is
of course to understand how and why local bank branches become specialized in funding one
specific industry (more than other neighbour branches do). A possible cause of specialization
may be diffusion effects within networks of customers (e.g., buyers and suppliers, or members
of local professional clubs): in other words, the lending pattern of a branch is likely to be
history-dependent. An idiosyncratic role of some loan officers, who e.g. join a branch with
a better experience in dealing with a certain type of firms, also comes to mind. In this
case, the pending issue for bank managers is to ensure that such human capital is not lost
whenever the branch closes. Drexler and Schoar (2014) suggest that soft information can be
transferred between bank employees when loan officer turnover is properly anticipated. The
same could be expected regarding transfers of industry-specific knowledge.

Note: This map locates all bank branches lending to SMEs in mainland France as of De-
cember 2016 (left panel) vs “specialized” branches only (right panel). See section 3 for the
definition of the industry specialization of bank branches. Location refers to the ZIP code
of the branch. ZIP codes in white are cities without any bank branch lending to SMEs in
December 2016. The darkest color stands for ZIP codes where more than 100 bank branches

concentration of specialized branches is an HHI index that is equal to one if, within a bank, all
specialized branches are specialized in the same industry and close to zero if each specialized
branch is specialized in a different industry. Larger banks are banks which operate more
than 10 branches lending to SMEs.

Note: This table shows estimation level for regression (2.6). The sample period is Q1
2010 to Q3 2017. The dependent variable is the log amount of total credit outstanding
(in euro thousands) at the firm-bank i, b level, in quarter t (including unused credit lines).
Closing × Post is the 16-quarter period starting after the official date of branch closure.
Announcement × Post is the 6-quarter period starting with the announcement of the branch
closure and ending with the official branch closure. ∆ specialization is the difference between
the lagged level of specialization of the closing branch over 4 quarters (moving average) and
the lagged level of specialization of the absorbing branch the quarter before the absorption.
Closing × Post × Specialization loss indicates that the closing branch was specialized while
the absorbing branch is not (∆ specialization = 1). On the contrary, Closing × Post ×
Specialization gain indicates that the closing branch was not specialized while the absorbing
branch is (∆ specialization = -1). Urban Unit denotes the urban unit of the location of the
firm. ∆ distance is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the closure triggers an increase in the
firm-bank distance larger than 20 km, and -1 if the closure reduces the distance by more than
20 km. Low competition is a dummy equal to one if competition in the local credit market
(measured in the UU of the absorbing branch) is below the median. High competition is a
dummy equal to one if local bank competition is above the median. Robust standard errors
(clustered at the urban unit x year level) are in parentheses.

Aggregate Implications of Credit
Relationship Flows
This chapter is based on a paper co-authored with Yasser Boualam (University of North
Carolina - Chapel Hill).

                                          Abstract
This paper studies the aggregate properties of credit relationship flows within the commercial
loan market in France from 1998 through 2017. Using detailed bank-firm level data from
the French Credit Register, we derive a novel decomposition for credit dynamics and show
that banks actively and continuously adjust their lending supply along both extensive and
intensive margins. We document that gross flows associated with credit relationships (i) are
volatile and pervasive throughout the cycle, and (ii) can account for up to 46% of the cyclical
and 90% of the long-run variations in aggregate bank credit. We also highlight the role of
the extensive margin in the transmission of monetary policy and show that the timing and
magnitude of its response differ from that of the intensive margin.

1.    Introduction

            hat drives the fluctuations of credit over the business cycle and in the long run?

W            How do banks adjust their credit supply in response to aggregate shocks or
             policy changes? These questions have been at the forefront of macro-finance
and banking research at least since the seminal work of Bernanke (1983). Yet, our under-
standing of aggregate credit fluctuations and their implications for the real economy remains
incomplete on several fronts.

Bank credit is a significant source of financing for the majority of businesses. One particularly
important aspect that has been extensively studied at the micro level, yet overlooked in
macro, has to do with bank-firm credit relationships. Indeed, a vast theoretical and empirical
literature has long highlighted the role of these relationships in terms of alleviating agency
frictions and shaping credit supply at the lender-borrower level.1 It also emphasized the
existence of cross-sectional heterogeneity in terms of match quality and inherent relationship
characteristics such as duration, which can potentially hinder banks’ ability to adjust their
credit supply in a frictionless way (Boualam (2018)). Conversely, the common view across
most macro-finance models either simply assumes homogeneous borrowers and/or lenders,
or abstracts from the long-term nature of financial contracts and any market frictions that
may prevent banks from costlessly forming or severing these credit matches. These models
thus downplay the value of relationships and their aggregate consequences and imply that
banks can swiftly adjust the number of their borrowers in response to shocks. They also
leave little room for analyzing the process of credit reallocation across bank-firm matches
and its dynamics throughout the cycle.

This paper proposes a novel macro perspective on the process of credit intermediation. It
aims to provide further empirical evidence on the key and distinctive roles played by both the
intensive and extensive margins in shaping aggregate credit fluctuations. Here, we attempt
to look behind such fluctuations in order to address first-order questions such as: (i) When
aggregate bank credit declines by 5%, is it because the average loan size (i.e., intensive
margin) drops by 5%, or is it because 5% of bank-firm matches (i.e., extensive margin) are
destroyed? (ii) Does the origin of aggregate credit fluctuations matter? (iii) Do monetary
policy shocks impact these margins differently?

To our knowledge, we are the first to show that banks actively adjust both the number
and the intensity of their relationships, in response to macroeconomic shocks, and that
both of these margins represent a significant source of variation in bank lending. These
adjustments are somewhat analogous to the ways in which firms constantly adjust both
quantity of hours worked and employment, or their capacity utilization and new capital
investment.2 This view may sound intuitive, yet — and surprisingly — a thorough analysis
of the dynamics of these margins and their macroeconomic implications remains limited, if
not completely absent. Furthermore, we not only establish the quantitative importance of
these margins, but we also argue that they are subject to prominently different aggregate
   1
     See Boot (2000) and Degryse et al. (2009) for a survey of earlier work.
   2
     To some extent, our analysis of credit markets follows in the footsteps of Lilien and Hall (1986), who
first decomposed the fluctuations in total hours worked into changes in employment and changes in hours
worked per employed worker.

behaviors. Thus, disentangling the effects associated with each margin can prove informative
about the economic mechanisms at play and the role of credit reallocation, and ultimately
yield relevant policy implications.

To shed light on this process, we leverage a key source of information, the French Credit
Register, which covers the commercial loan market in France, and is maintained by Banque de
France. The data contain granular and nearly exhaustive records of bank-firm matches and
corresponding credit exposures over the period 1998-2018. To study the properties of credit
relationship flows, we develop an empirical methodology akin to the one pioneered by Davis
and Haltiwanger (1992) for labor flows. Our methodology takes into consideration specific
characteristics associated with credit market structure and available data. For example, we
track data entries for each bank-firm match to determine the time of creation and inferred
time of destruction in order to construct the associated gross credit relationship flows. We
also account for cross-sectional heterogeneity and the nature of financial contracts through
key attributes such as loan size, credit type and maturity, and relationship duration.

Understanding the implications of bank-firm credit relationships is a natural undertaking.
However, a dearth of empirical evidence documenting their macro-level properties exists
due to the paucity of extensive micro datasets over a sufficiently long period of time. In
fact, earlier studies such as Dell’Ariccia and Garibaldi (2005) relied on bank-level call report
data. Thus, they cannot identify the involved borrowers and can observe net intensive flows
only at the bank level. As a consequence, these studies cannot disentangle extensive from
intensive margins, nor precisely capture the underlying magnitude and properties of credit
reallocation. Instead, we advance here a novel approach to exploit information available in
credit registers, which is typically used in micro settings, to uncover new aggregate findings.

Our research establishes the following stylized facts about the extensive and intensive margins
of credit:

  1. Extensive and intensive margins fluctuate continuously over time. While their persis-
     tence is roughly identical, the volatility of the intensive margin is relatively higher.
  2. Both margins are important at the business cycle frequency, with the extensive margin
     contributing about one quarter to one half of the variance in aggregate credit.
  3. In the long run, the extensive margin accounts for the bulk of aggregate credit varia-
     tions.

Our analysis also highlights the following features pertaining to gross credit relationship
flows:

  1. The creation, destruction, and reallocation of bank-firm relationships coexist through-

                                              159


     out the cycle.
  2. Creation (inflows) and destruction (outflows) of relationships show greater volatility
     compared to net flows. Variations in net flows are driven mainly by inflows.
  3. Outflows are more volatile for small and short-term loans and credit relationships with
     duration of less than one year. Inflows are more volatile for relationships with small
     loans or lines of credit.

Our results also highlight that credit patterns observed during or in the aftermath of an
economic downturn are driven potentially by multiple combinations of extensive and intensive
margin sources, suggesting that different economic mechanisms may be at play. A better
understanding of the extensive/intensive origin of a credit decline and its bottlenecks can
thus be relevant to the design of effective and targeted policy tools. In this context, we
analyze how monetary policy gets transmitted through both extensive and intensive margin
channels. We show that while the intensive margin responds immediately and strongly to
monetary policy surprises, the extensive margin’s response is relatively more gradual and
subdued during easing regimes. We also note that the extensive margin channel is at play
mainly for relatively small banks or those with flexible balance sheets.

Our empirical framework also provides us with tools to better understand the reallocation
process occurring in credit markets and the channels through which bank shocks get trans-
mitted to the real economy. In particular, we show that the excess reallocation rate of credit
relationships is countercyclical, in line with the cleansing effect of recessions. In addition,
yearly (excess) reallocation rates have been steadily declining over the past two decades.
These results indicate the existence of factors hampering credit market fluidity and contain
relevant theoretical and policy ramifications worthy of further investigation.

Literature Review. This paper aims to connect two distinct yet complementary ap-
proaches to bank credit: macroeconomic research on credit cycles and microeconomic liter-
ature on relationship banking. The literature on credit cycles has long emphasized the role
of credit constraints stemming from the borrower side (starting with Bernanke and Gertler
(1989) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)). More recently, this literature has shifted focus
toward analyzing bank constraints and decisions.3 Yet, both of these prominent strands
generally abstract from long-term contracts and omit frictions stemming from market struc-
ture, and can hardly relate the role of bank or firm heterogeneity to the process of credit
reallocation. At the same time, the banking literature has largely demonstrated the impor-
tance of relationships in shaping credit, albeit theoretical and empirical studies therein have

focused mostly on the micro level with limited macroeconomic implications.

The paper’s contribution resides in providing empirical foundations and assessing the macroe-
conomic relevance of a complementary line of research that puts forward a flow-driven ap-
proach to credit markets. This approach posits the essential role of bank-firm match dy-
namics in aggregate credit and has been introduced theoretically in Den Haan et al. (2003)
and Becsi et al. (2005). More recently, Boualam (2018) builds a general equilibrium model
featuring frictional credit markets and long-term contracts and argues that the destruction
of bank-firm relationships during crises can significantly slow down recoveries. In a related
micro approach, Mazet-Sonilhac (2020) empirically investigates how the reduction in search
frictions, driven by the introduction of broadband internet, impacts bank-firm matching and
aggregate credit flows. From a methodological standpoint, our approach is closely related to
the one commonly used to examine job flows, and specifically to earlier studies conducted
by Steven Davis and John Haltiwanger and partly summarized in Davis and Haltiwanger
(1999).

Our work is also part of a nascent literature on credit flows and reallocation, which in-
cludes Dell’Ariccia and Garibaldi (2005), Herrera et al. (2011), Craig and Haubrich (2013),
and Contessi and Francis (2013). One closely related paper to ours is by Dell’Ariccia and
Garibaldi (2005), who use bank-level information to track credit flows along the intensive
margin. We argue that the use of bank-level data, while informative about flows “on the
surface,” in fact masks the extent of credit reallocation and cannot provide information
about the dynamics of bank-firm relationships.4 In the same vein, Herrera et al. (2011)
work with firm-level data to measure inter-firm credit reallocation. Although that paper
provides a valuable first step toward our understanding of credit reallocation, its focus is not
on bank credit, but rather on a broad definition encompassing all forms except trade credit.
In addition, the Compustat data used in that analysis cannot fully capture the extent of
reallocation across borrowers and lenders, nor account for relatively small firms. In contrast,
our paper is the first to use loan-level data to carefully establish patterns and stylized facts
about gross credit relationship flows in order to distinguish extensive and intensive margin
effects and uncover the underlying reallocation dynamics. Our unit of observation is the
bank-firm match, which allows us to precisely measure credit reallocation at the loan level.
This level is key because inter-bank reallocation or inter-firm credit reallocation measures
tend to significantly underestimate the magnitudes of the underlying gross flows.5
   4
      For example, banks may well be reallocating credit across their borrowers even though their net credit
growth is zero.
    5
      A contemporaneous research work by Cuciniello and Di Iasio (2020) also investigates a credit decompo-
sition into extensive/intensive margins using the Italian Credit Register data, and, in line with our results,


                                                    161


The paper is also broadly related to the literature quantifying the sources of aggregate credit
fluctuations and the transmission of shocks stemming from either borrowers or lenders.6
Among others, three recent papers are connected to ours. Jiménez et al. (2014) identify
the bank risk-taking channel of monetary policy through a bank-firm level analysis using
Spanish loan application and credit register data. Amiti and Weinstein (2018) use matched
bank-firm loan-level Japanese data with a focus on publicly listed companies to measure the
importance of idiosyncratic granular bank supply shocks and their implications for credit
and firm investment. Beaumont et al. (2019), with whom we share the use of the French
Credit Register, suggest additional effects stemming from granular borrower shocks. Our
paper differs from these in that it focuses on the role played by credit relationship flows,
and analyzes the extensive/intensive margin decompositions of credit from an aggregate
perspective.

Finally, while we have focused almost entirely on aggregate outcomes here, an ongoing com-
panion paper, Boualam and Mazet-Sonilhac (2021), analyzes the data from a disaggregated
perspective and delivers complementary results on cross-sectional properties and credit re-
allocation.

Organization. The paper proceeds as follows. We first start by outlining our empirical
methodology and its conceptual foundations in Section 2. We then present our core results for
gross relationship flows (Section 3), and aggregate credit decompositions (Section 4). Section
5 explores the properties of credit during crises and recovery and Section 6 investigates
macroeconomic implications. Section 7 discusses other relevant applications and extensions
and Section 8 concludes.


2.     Empirical Methodology
The central objective of this paper is to shed light on the importance of the extensive
margin of credit, and to document aggregate patterns and cyclical properties of gross credit
relationship flows along with their intensive margin counterpart. This section first introduces
conceptual foundations behind our measurements and then discusses the data and lays out
our empirical methodology.
confirms the prominent role played by the extensive margin throughout the business cycle.

2.1.   Conceptual Foundations: a Flow Approach to Credit Markets
We focus on the aggregate implications behind the dynamics of bank-firm relationships. It
is thus essential to disentangle the extensive and intensive margins of credit. We start with
a simple credit market identity, which states that total aggregate credit supplied by banks,
Ct , is the product of the number of credit relationships (i.e., extensive margin), Nt , which
we refer to as relationship capital, and the average credit exposure per relationship (i.e.,
intensive margin), c̄t :

                                      Ct = Nt × c̄t .                                    (3.1)


This decomposition presupposes that all firms are ex-ante identical and that credit relation-
ships are all homogeneous. Although this approach potentially masks compositional effects,
it has the merits of being straightforward and easy to interpret and measure. In that sense,
the underlying changes in the extensive and intensive margins shape the dynamics of ag-
gregate credit. Furthermore, we can write down the dynamics of relationship capital as
follows:

                                Nt+1 = Nt + Ct+1 − Dt+1 ,                                (3.2)

where Ct+1 and Dt+1 represent creation and destruction flows materialized between times t
and t + 1, respectively. These creation and destruction flows can take multiple forms within
credit markets. Figure 3.1 represents them conceptually from the firms’ perspective. We
consider that firms can be in one of two states: (i) funded, or (ii) unfunded. Creation flows
can thus represent the formation of a bank-firm relationship (as the unfunded firms become
funded), but also situations where already funded firms switch banks or accumulate multiple
banking relationships. In a similar vein, destruction flows represent the severance of credit
relationships. These destructions can be viewed as “internal” to the credit market, as is the
case for firms transitioning from funded to unfunded states, switching banks, or separating
from part of their established banking relationships. These flows can also be “external,”
whereby the bank-firm match destruction is due to permanent firm exit or default.

In the spirit of the labor market literature, we rely on search theory insights to provide the
conceptual grounds underlying our measurements of gross credit relationship flows. We also
follow general insights from Boualam (2018), who posits that credit markets are subject
to imperfections, akin to search frictions, and that this may lead to a form of asymmetric
adjustment costs in bank relationship capital. In addition, the total credit intermediated is


                                             163


a function of the number of relationships but also of their intensity and composition. As
search is costly, banks and firms spend time looking for matches. Frictions affecting the
matching, severance, and reallocation of bank-firm pairs acts as a form of credit adjustment
cost. We view credit relationship creation and destruction as inherent to a large process of
adjustment and reallocation of capital across banks and firms. One key insight is that these
adjustments are time-varying, with potentially asymmetric costs associated with creation
and destruction and extensive and intensive margins. These costs may also depend on bank,
firm, and credit relationship characteristics. Thus, we exploit concepts laid out by this flow-
driven approach, and construct novel measures that shed light on the structure of credit
markets and bank-firm relationships.


2.2.      Definitions and Measurement
Next we propose new measures for credit relationship flows, credit exposure, and relationship
intensity and lay down their underlying assumptions and interpretations. Our definitions
rely on the conceptual foundations above and follow in the footsteps of earlier studies of
gross job flows (Davis et al. (1998)).

Credit Relationship (CR) Flows

We start with the definition of creation and destruction flows and credit relationships.7

Definition 1. x

       • Credit Relationship Creation (inflow). First occurrence of a bank-firm match
         with strictly positive credit exposure at time t, assuming no previous match over the
         preceding 4 quarters, i.e., between t-4 and t-1.
       • Credit Relationship Destruction (outflow). Last occurrence of a bank-firm
         match, assuming no further match for at least the next 4 quarters, i.e., between t+1
         and t+4.8
       • Credit Relationship. Existing bank-firm match at time t, whereby t lies within the
         creation and destruction dates.

Our definitions put forward the theoretical construct of a credit relationship.9 Figure 3.2
   7
     An earlier version of these flow definitions was proposed in Boualam (2018).
   8
     Our choice of a 4-quarter gap is informed by existing data and the fact that most “recalls” occur within
the first year (for example, we find that only 10.5% of severed relationships are recreated 5 to 8 quarters
later). Our results are qualitatively unchanged if we allow for the number of quarters to be 8 and 12, as
shown in the Online Appendix.
   9
     Throughout the paper, we refer to credit relationships and bank-firm matches interchangeably.



                                                    164


depicts possible configurations in the data and our measurement choices. We assume that
borrower information is not lost immediately upon the expiration of a given credit facility,
but only after a relatively long interaction-free period of several quarters. This approach
helps to account for the fact that banks and firms may engage in lengthy negotiations before
closing a loan deal, and also adjusts for cases where credit exposures temporarily decline
below the mandatory reporting threshold and for potential reporting gaps in the data. Note
that while the last occurrence of a bank-firm match may be at quarter t, the destruction of
such match in fact happens some time between quarter t and t + 1, and is thus accounted
for at time t + 1. Note also that our definitions do not preclude situations where banks and
a firms engage in several credit relationship creation and destruction rounds throughout the
sample.

We can then tabulate gross credit relationship flows, i.e., creation flows, Ct , and destruction
flows, Dt , based on the sum of all bank-firm relationships that are either created or destroyed
between times t−1 and t. In the same vein, we can define, at time t, the net credit relationship
flows, Nt+1 , as the difference between inflows and outflows; the reallocation flows, Rt , as the
sum of inflows and outflows; and excess reallocation flows, Xt , as the sum of inflows and
outflows minus the absolute value of net flows:

                                    Nt = Ct − Dt
                                    Rt = Ct + Dt
                                    Xt = Ct + Dt − |Nt |.


In this context, excess reallocation for credit relationships measures the extent of reallocation
in excess of that needed to generate the corresponding net changes in total credit relation-
ships. For example, simultaneous creation and destruction flows on the order of 10% do
not impact the stock of credit relationships in the economy, yet imply a large level of credit
reshuffling across firms and banks and an excess reallocation of 20%. We can eventually
compute the corresponding flow rates (denoted with lowercase characters), by dividing the
measure of flows experienced between times t − 1 and t, by the relationship capital stock at
time t − 1, Nt−1 .

Relationship Intensity: Credit Exposure, Type, Maturity, and Duration

Besides bank and firm characteristics, the credit relationship itself can be characterized along
several dimensions that define the intensity of a match. We consider here three measures,
namely (i) credit exposure, (ii) type/maturity, and (iii) duration.

                                              165


Credit Exposure, Type and Maturity. We start by defining the credit exposure of a
bank to a given borrowing firm, as the sum of withdrawn and undrawn credit, in addition
to bank credit guarantees.10 We further decompose the withdrawn component by maturity
(i.e., short-term and long-term) and other, less common forms of credit (e.g., credit leasing,
securitized debt, overdrafts limits).


Definition 2. x

       • On-Balance-sheet Credit. Accounts for long-term (>1 year) and short-term (<1
         year) credit.11
       • Off-Balance-sheet Credit. Accounts for lines of credit and credit guarantees.12
       • Credit Exposure. Sum of on-balance-sheet credit and off-balance-sheet credit.

We characterize the intensity of the credit relationship based on the nature and maturity of
credit involved. We define (i) the share of on-balance-sheet credit as a ratio over total credit
exposure, and (ii) the share of long-term credit as a ratio over on-balance-sheet credit. These
measures reflect the level of commitment from the bank’s perspective. A credit relationship
is less binding when consisting only of short-term or off-balance-sheet credit that banks can
swiftly reduce following an adverse shock.

Relationship Duration. Next we consider relationship duration as another measure of
the intensity of a bank-firm match. Indeed, the repeated interaction between borrowers and
lenders can help gradually alleviate agency and informational frictions and eventually lead
to higher credit supply over time.


Definition 3. x

       • Credit Relationship Duration. The duration dij,t of an ongoing credit relationship
         between bank i and firm j corresponds to the number of quarters between time t and its
         creation date.
  10
     A credit guarantee covers a debtor’s liabilities in case of delinquency. It enables the borrower to contract
third-party liabilities by transferring counterparty risk to the bank, thereby creating an implicit credit
exposure.
  11
     This definition also accounts for medium- and long-term leasing and factoring, but these categories are
omitted from our calculations as they represent less than 1% of on-balance-sheet credit.
  12
     This definition also accounts for securitized loans. We omit this category from our calculations as it is
represents a negligible share of off-balance-sheet credit.




                                                      166


2.3.    The French Credit Register
Our analysis essentially relies on the French Credit Register, referred to as Service Central des
Risques (henceforth SCR). This is a monthly database that contains bank credit exposures to
borrowing firms over the period 1998-2018. This is the most comprehensive commercial credit
dataset maintained by Banque de France and is used to monitor overall credit supply and risk
exposures of domestic banks. The data are generated from detailed mandatory reports filed
by all credit institutions (classified through a unique Code Interbancaire (CIB) identifier)
and which list any credit commitment or risk exposure to any borrowing firm (as defined
by a legal unit and referenced by a unique national identification number, SIREN). Reports
encompass the funds made available or drawn credits; banks’ credit line and guarantee
commitments; in addition to leasing, factoring, and securitized loans.

Reporting financial intermediaries account for all resident credit institutions, and investment
firms. Thus, the dataset provides an extensive account of existing bank-firm linkages, pro-
vided that the credit exposure is above the legal nominal reporting threshold of EUR 75,000
for the period 1998-2005 or EUR 25,000 from 2006 onward.

Data Construction. Our sample excludes firms headquartered outside Metropolitan France,
self-employed entrepreneurs, and certain types of entities such as nonprofit organizations.13 It
also omits observations related to public credit institutions, non-traditional banking groups,
and non-credit intermediaries, which may have different objectives compared to more stan-
dard banks.14 We also exclude very small institutions with credit exposures averaging less
than EUR 1 million quarterly.

We choose to work at the quarterly frequency given our analysis objective and the consid-
erable size of available data. We also construct bank-firm relationships at the bank level
(instead of branch or banking group levels). We deflate all credit variables using the GDP
deflator for France.15 We similarly define the reporting threshold in real terms. Further-
more, we focus on bank-firm pairs using the inflation-adjusted threshold (corresponding to
EUR 75,000 in 1998) throughout the sample period in order to make sure that our analysis
remains consistent over time despite the 2006 change in reporting.16

     These include Caisse des Depots et Consignations, Oseo, and Banque de Developpement des PME,
which later became Banque Publique d’Investissement (BPI) in 2015. Credit supplied through public banks
accounts for about 15% of the total credit over the sample period.

     All credit variables are reported in terms of 1998 EUR based on the GDP implicit price deflator in
France constructed by the OECD and retrieved from FRED (FRAGDPDEFQISMEI).

     The reporting threshold is fixed to EUR 75,000 at the beginning of the sample period and is adjusted
over time. Given that inflation remains positive overall throughout the sample period, this means that we

Our cleaned baseline dataset contains about 27 million bank-firm-quarter observations over
the period 1998Q1-2018Q4, involving 715 unique banks (447 banks per quarter on average)
and 940,554 unique firms (256,271 firms per quarter on average). Figures 3.3(a) and 3.3(b)
report the evolution of the number of banks and firms and that of total credit and relationship
capital, respectively. While the banking sector experienced intense consolidation over the
sample period with the number of banks declining by a third, the number of firms relying
on bank credit had almost doubled during that time.

Comparison with Aggregate Flow of Funds Data. Our final sample covers about
61% of total bank credit to non-financial companies as reported in the balance of payments
available through the Flow of Funds data. The two time series exhibit similar aggregate
patterns overall, with correlations of 0.99 for total credit and 0.98 for long-term credit.


2.4.    Issues and Adjustments
Our data and empirical methodology are subject to certain limitations and other standard
issues, which may tend to affect the level of relationship flows. These include (i) seasonality,
(ii) bank and firm consolidations, and (iii) variations in the reporting threshold. We attempt
to correct for these limitations and discuss them in detail in this section.17

Seasonality. The flow data exhibit strong seasonality patterns with higher creation flows
in quarter 1 and higher destruction flows in quarter 4. We use the standard X-13 procedure
to generate seasonally adjusted time series. Furthermore, and although such issues appear
to be negligible, we smooth the data using a centered moving average (-1,1) to control for
potentially mistimed reports of credit exposures.18

Bank Consolidation. The French banking sector has undergone several rounds of con-
solidations throughout our sample period. As shown in Figure 3.3(a), the number of banks
declined from 547 to 342 from 1998 through 2017. This is due almost exclusively to mergers
and acquisitions, as bank entry and exit events were negligible during this period. Bank
consolidations may lead to spurious inflows and outflows when the acquiring bank starts
omit a small fraction of bank-firm relationships present in the data but that exhibit below-threshold credit
exposures.
  17
     We relegate other minor issues such as those related to the change in the reporting of some categories
(e.g., off-balance-sheet credit) and the classification of non-performing credit and ensuing adjustments to the
Online Appendix.
  18
     For example, a loan deal that closes on December 31 might not be officially reported until the following
quarter. Similarly, a relationship that gets terminated on January 1 might not be accounted for until the
next quarter.

reporting the credit relationships originally attributed to the acquired bank. For example,
consider a merger where Bank A acquires Bank B between times t − 1 and t. At time t − 1,
outflows stemming from bank B, OB,t−1 , are overestimated given that Bank B stops report-
ing. In a similar vein, inflows tabulated from Bank A at time t are overestimated by the
same amount, OB,t−1 , as transferred relationships are treated as if they were newly formed.

We remedy to this issue following the methodology in Dell’Ariccia and Garibaldi (2005) and
using the list of bank merger events maintained by the French Supervision and Prudential
Authority (ACPR). This list accounts for all banking M&A activity involving banks located
in France over the period 1995 through 2016. We thus proceed by (i) setting acquired Bank
B’s outflows to zero at t − 1 (OB,t−1 = 0) and (ii) reducing the time t inflows associated
with acquiring Bank A by OB,t−1 . We omit mergers involving banks with missing identifiers,
which account for less than 3% of M&A events. We also complement these adjustments by
manually checking the database and accounting for more complex situations, such as the
consolidation of Caisse d’Epargne and Banque Populaire.19

Firm Consolidation. M&A activity at the firm level could also generate spurious flows.
For example, when Firm A absorbs Firm B that is linked to Bank C, our measurement
definitions would record the simultaneous destruction of the B-C match and the creation of
a new A-C match instead. While we cannot adjust directly for these flows in the absence of
an exhaustive corporate M&A database for France, we can show that the M&A-induced flows
represent a negligible fraction of our tabulated measures. We estimate the existence of fewer
than 40,000 instances of firm consolidations in France over the period 1999-2018 through
Bureau Van Dijk’s Zephyr database, the most comprehensive dataset available to us. This
number represents less than 0.15% of bank-firm credit relationships and about 2% of total
gross flows over the sample period. Furthermore, when considering only the subsample of
larger firms reported in FIBEN (i.e., the universe of firms for which balance-sheet information
is collected by Banque de France), we estimate that a conservative upper bound for the share
of M&A-induced flows is around 5 to 6%. Finally, we note that our analysis is immune from
other types of activity leading to ownership or name changes for standalone companies, given
that their legal identifier (SIREN) is unique and remains constant irrespective of ownership
or other legal adjustments.

Reporting Threshold. Given that we consider only those bank-firm relationships for
which the total credit exposure exceeds EUR 75,000, we check that the flows of relationship
  19
    This case corresponds to the absorption of one banking subsidiary by multiple acquiring banks. Here,
we correct for this merger through a uniform adjustment of inflows across all acquirers.


                                                  169


creation and destruction are not driven simply by threshold-crossing increases or declines
in credit, which can mechanically generate a positive correlation between extensive and
intensive margins.

While we cannot fully rule out this possibility, we carefully address it and estimate its
extent through the following tests. First, our definition of creation and destruction flows is
conservative, as it accounts for an effective relationship separation only if a bank-firm match
has been inactive (i.e., absent from the SCR database) for four consecutive quarters. That
way, temporary declines in credit, below the reporting thresholds, do not generate spurious
episodes of relationship destruction followed by creation. Second, we re-run our analysis
based on a EUR 25,000 reporting threshold over the period 2006-2018 and show that the
obtained patterns are qualitatively and quantitatively in line with our benchmark results.
Third, we can trace back a large fraction of relationship creation and confirm that a vast
majority is due to either new entrant firms (based on their creation dates obtained from the
SIRENE database) or bank switches. Similarly, a large fraction of relationship destruction
is due to defaulting or exiting firms in addition to switches. Fourth, we show that the
average credit supplied at the time of creation or destruction of credit relationships hovers
around EUR 500,000, about seven to eight times higher than the reporting thresholds, which
further mitigates the extent of any related bias. The Online Appendix reports robustness
tests associated with the reporting threshold.


2.5.   Summary Statistics and Aggregate Time Series
Table 3.1 reports summary statistics for key variables pertaining to banks, firms, and credit
relationships. The average bank has 802 distinct borrowing firms with an average credit
exposure of EUR 1.03 million each (based on 1998 EUR). Furthermore, this exposure consists
of about EUR 413 thousand in long-term debt, EUR 214 thousand in short-term debt, and
EUR 413 thousand in undrawn credit lines.

The average number of banking relationships exhibited a slight decline from around 1.45 to
1.32, with the fraction of firms engaged in a single relationship hovering around 80%. On the
other hand, banks have grown bigger, and serviced about two-and-a-half times more firms
in 2016 relative to 1999. Perhaps more surprising is that the average credit exposure per
firm remained relatively stable in real terms throughout the sample period, around EUR one
million.

The composition of debt has shifted, however, toward long-term credit and credit lines at the
expense of short-term credit, as seen in Panel (a) of Figure 3.4. We see that the percentage


                                             170


share of long-term credit (over total credit exposure) surprisingly increases while the share
of short-term credit declines during crises, which potentially reduces banks’ ability to adjust
their credit exposure. This finding is consistent with firms mostly withdrawing from their
long-term, pre-committed credit lines, in line with U.S. evidence (Ivashina and Scharfstein
(2010)).

Banks and firms engage in relatively long-term relationships. We estimate the average dura-
tion of a match to be on the order of 15 quarters, a bit shorter than four years.20 Tabulating
the weighted average relationship duration in the economy may be subject to some biases
that could lead to spuriously large (resulting from a small subset of relationships with ex-
tremely long duration) or low numbers. We therefore choose instead to track relationships
classified as those with durations of below and above two years, in order to have a better
sense of how the distribution of relationship durations evolves over time. Panel (b) in Figure
3.4 shows the steadily decline the fraction of relationships with duration below two years,
consistent with a lower rate of bank-firm destruction.21

Credit exposures associated with newly created (destroyed) relationships, account for 57%
(45%) of that of incumbents, which corresponds to about EUR 570 (450) thousand, well
above the reporting threshold. Furthermore, the average credit amount supplied to newly
created relationships (or previously supplied to exiting firms) is procyclical, suggesting that
the sub-extensive margin may play an important role in aggregate credit fluctuations. We
will get back to this point in Section 4.


3.      Properties of Credit Relationship Flows
We now analyze the properties of credit relationship flows. Here, we show that the processes
of creation, destruction, and reallocation of credit relationships are (i) significantly large, (ii)
volatile, (iii) asymmetric, and (iv) inherent to credit markets at all times.


3.1.    Aggregate Patterns
Figure 3.5(a) exhibits the aggregate patterns for flows. Gross credit relationship flows are
inherent to credit markets and exhibit relatively large magnitudes and volatilities. They are
also quite large relative to the underlying net flows. Our results suggest that about 1 in 14
  20
     This is in fact a lower-bound estimate, as we assign a duration of 0 to all bank-firm matches existing in
1998Q1, the starting date of the sample. We also do not count quarters in which the bank-firm match may
be missing from the SCR when its credit exposure level drops below the reporting threshold.
  21
     We select this threshold because the data show a distinct behavior for very young relationships relative
to the rest. The two-year threshold is also chosen mainly so as to keep the longest possible time series.


                                                    171


credit relationships is created and 1 in 16 is destroyed on a quarterly basis. On average,
23,407 positive flows (6.94%) and 21,497 negative flows (6.32%) combine to generate 1,910
net flows (0.62%) per quarter. As a result, the excess reallocation rate is on the order of
12.51% per quarter. Moreover, these gross flows appear to closely track each other through-
out the sample period. This observation further illustrates that the substantial process of
credit reshuffling across financial institutions and borrowers is continuously reshaping credit
markets. We also note that both gross flows exhibit downward trends, with quarterly flow
rates of relationship creation and destruction declining from about 8.6% to 6% and from
6.8% to 5.8%, respectively, over the sample period.


3.2.   Cyclical Properties
We examine the cyclical properties of gross credit relationship flows and characterize the
magnitude of their fluctuations. We detrend all flow rates using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP)
filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Figure 3.5(b) presents the corresponding cyclical
deviations from the HP trend. We also tabulate the volatility, autocorrelation, and correla-
tion with respect to log-growth of GDP, aggregate credit, and relationship capital, for each
variable of interest. Table 3.2 formalizes these results.

First, we establish that creation flows (measured in levels or rates) of credit relationships
are two to three times as volatile as their destruction counterpart. The standard deviation
of creation flows is 0.044 for levels (0.0027 for rates), while the volatility of destruction flows
is 0.026 for levels (0.0013 for rates). Second, and maybe unsurprisingly, rates of creation
flows are positively correlated with growth rate of GDP (0.44), aggregate credit (0.47),
and relationship capital (0.64). On the other hand, rates of destruction flows exhibit only a
moderately negative correlation with GDP (-0.084), aggregate credit (-0.14), and relationship
capital (-0.26). We confirm results when looking at the levels of creation and destruction
flows. Third, we establish that the variations of net flows are relatively large, with a volatility
of 0.051. Indeed, the procyclical nature of inflows and the countercyclical nature of outflows
combine to generate large movements in net flows. Fourth, we can measure the relative
contribution of each component toward the overall variance of (detrended) net flows using
the following decomposition:

                                       cov(ct , nt ) cov(−dt , nt )
                               1 =                  +               ,                        (3.3)
                                        var(nt )       var(nt )
                                       | {z } |          {z       }
                                           βpos            βneg



and show that positive flows account for about 84% of the variation in net relationship flows

                                                  172


while negative flows account for only about 16%.

This result is robust across sample periods. Taking the periods pre- and post- 2008 separately,
we observe that the creation margin drives net flows, while the destruction rates remain
relatively stable. Furthermore, we also highlight a regime shift taking place around the
financial crisis, with negative flow rates declining from their 6.5-7 percent range, pre-crisis,
to a 5.5-6 percent range.22

Overall, and from an aggregate perspective, this finding suggests that the critical adjustment
variable for relationship capital is along the creation margin, as banks may have limited
control over destruction flows. This result confirms earlier findings obtained in Boualam
(2018) for the U.S., based on Dealscan data, but disagrees with that reported in Dell’Ariccia
and Garibaldi (2005) and Herrera et al. (2011), who use bank-level and loan-level data,
respectively.23,24


3.3.       What Drives the Creation and Destruction of Credit Relationships?
Figure 3.6 presents the decomposition of creation and destruction of credit matches as follows:

       • Creation flows: (i) bank switches and multi-bank firms experiencing a relationship
         gain (“positive reallocation”) and (ii) new firm entry (with credit exposure above the
         threshold).
       • Destruction flows: (i) bank switches and multi-bank firms experiencing a relationship
         loss (“negative reallocation”), (ii) firm default, and (iii) firm exit (excluding default)
         or with a loan below the reporting threshold closed.

A bank switch is defined as the simultaneous move from one lender to another, which corre-
sponds to the destruction of the original relationship and the creation of a new one within a
four-quarter interval. We define multi-bank firm relationship gains (losses) as the incremental
addition (drop) of a credit relationship induced by firms with a (multiple) pre-existing rela-
tionship(s). Here, we also choose to report bank switches along with relationship gains/losses,
as some firms appear to switch from one lender to another at a gradual pace, generating
transitory periods where they are formally associated with two banks.
  22
     The relative importance of gross flows is also visible in the scatter plot in Figure 3.25 in the Online
Appendix.
  23
     Arguably, several differences across our samples may explain this discrepancy. Among others, these
studies focus on U.S. data and different sample periods. Equally important, they use data aggregated at the
bank or firm levels instead of working at the credit relationship level, as we do.
  24
     Interestingly, this result is also different from labor market studies, which suggest that job destruction
rates are more volatile and relatively more important for net labor flow fluctuations (Davis and Haltiwanger
(1992)).


                                                     173


Overall, we show that about two thirds of creation flows are due to new entrants, while
one third is due to incumbent firms switching to or matching with additional lenders. On
the other hand, we report that destruction flows are due to bank switches and multi-bank
firms experiencing a relationship loss (about 40%), firm exit (about 40%), and firm default
(20%). These contributions appear to be relatively stable across the sample period and each
component generally inherits the cyclical properties of the underlying gross flow. However,
this picture looks slightly different for net flows, which appear to be explained mostly by
the spread between entry and exit flows. Furthermore, despite the substantial volume of
their gross flows, incumbent borrowers who are either switching or adding/dropping credit
relationships have net flows comprising only about one fourth the volume of those exhibited
by entering and exiting firms.

How Important Are Firm Entry and Exit? We complement our analysis by using
the SIRENE database to help us determine the dates of firm entry (i.e., the firm’s legal
incorporation date) into the French economy. We then tabulate the ratio of first-time bor-
rowers (i.e., firms appearing in the SCR for the first time) over newly created firms (entrants)
within the same quarter.25 While the flows of entrant firms and those that obtain credit for
the first time are highly correlated (84%), their ratio exhibits stark dynamics. As shown in
Figure 3.7, the share of first-time borrowers over entrants presents a downward secular trend
(declining from about 26% to 20%) and procyclical patterns, suggesting that newly created
firms have harder time getting credit during crisis periods.26


3.4.    Cross-sectional Decomposition at the Relationship Level
We further uncover the determinants behind these fluctuations by analyzing the dynamics
of credit relationships as a function of their key characteristics, namely (i) credit exposure,
(ii) credit type and maturity, and (iii) duration. Figure 3.8 shows the times series associated
with gross flows and Table 3.3 presents the results pertaining to their cyclical properties.

Decomposition by Relationship Credit Exposure. We specify fixed dollar thresholds
at 250 thousand, 500 thousand, and 1 million EUR throughout the sample, and classify
bank-firm matches into small, medium, or large credit size categories on a quarterly basis.27
  25
     Unfortunately, there is no connecting table between firm identifiers in SIRENE and SCR datasets and
thus we cannot track the outcome of each individual entrant firm.
  26
     While we cannot completely rule out the possibility of a significant procyclical shift in credit exposure
to new entrants, our results remain unchanged even when considering the lower reporting threshold in the
second half of the sample.
  27
     Adjusting the size classification thresholds for inflation does not qualitatively alter the results.


                                                    174


Credit relationships classified by credit exposure into (i) small (below 0.25 million Euro),
(ii) medium (0.25 to 0.5 million Euro), (iii) large (0.5 to 1 million Euro), and (iv) very large
(above 1 million Euro) account for about 61%, 19%, 10%, and 10% of total relationships,
respectively. We show that gross and net flows associated with small loans exhibit a larger
volatility relative to the largest ones. They also exhibit the largest decline in inflows during
downturns. This suggests that banks consider their smaller relationships as a key variable of
adjustment throughout the cycle and reiterates the additional vulnerability of small borrow-
ers during crises. Thus, small loans have a significant impact on aggregate credit fluctuations
given their relative importance in terms of share in aggregate credit relationships and lending
volume.

Decomposition by Credit Type and Maturity. We decompose relationships by credit
type and maturity as follows: (i) credit line, (ii) short-term, (iii) long-term, and (iv) short
& long-term. Here, we will classify all credit lines within one category, given the limited
availability of information about their maturity.28 We observe that credit relationships based
solely on short-term credit or credit lines experience significantly larger gross flows than
relationships involving long-term credit. This suggests that these credit types offer more
adjustment/reallocation flexibility to banks, as they may be cheaper to originate and/or
less costly to break up. This interpretation is further supported by evidence that these two
categories are subject to large increases in outflows across all four crises, while long-term
credit relationships flows remain relatively stable.

Decomposition by Relationship Duration. We examine the effect of relationship du-
ration on outflows. We classify relationships into four buckets: duration of (i) below one
year, (ii) between one and two, (iii) between two and five, and (iv) above five years. The av-
erage shares associated with each category are 17%, 16%, 26%, and 41%, respectively. While
outflows appear to increase across all categories during most recessions (one exception being
a decline in outflows for one- to two-year duration relationships in 2008), the most sensitive
relationships are those that have been active for less than one year.

To summarize, mature credit relationships with large and long-term credit exposures are
overall more resilient during crisis periods relative to younger and smaller ones. They are
also potentially more difficult to initiate, as their inflow rates are substantially lower. These
results are not necessarily surprising in light of the positive relationship between duration
  28
     One could partially infer such maturity once the firm draws from the credit line and the corresponding
bank later reports the corresponding amount as short- or long-term credit.




                                                   175


and credit size and the negative relationship between duration and separation probability.29
As a result, the gross flow patterns we uncover may imply that different adjustment costs
are at play and depend on the value of the credit relationships, as measured by their size,
type, maturity, and duration. Indeed, it may be easier to sever a young or small bank-firm
match if the lost value from ending such a relationship is relatively minimal. In the same
vein, it is also easier to approve relatively small loans if this only marginally impacts the
credit and/or counterparty risk faced by the bank.


4.     How Do Banks Adjust Their Credit Supply Along
       Extensive and Intensive Margins?
What levers do banks use to adjust their credit supply? What is the relative importance
of extensive and intensive margins in credit fluctuations? These questions are inherent to
the macro-finance literature, yet they have surprisingly received very little attention. In
this section, we attempt to address them by exploring two related decompositions of credit
variations. We establish that accounting for the extensive margin is absolutely critical for
the proper inference of bank lending behavior in the aftermath of an aggregate shock or a
new policy implementation. Thus, grasping and measuring the channel through which credit
market participants form or sever matches is key to understanding of credit dynamics.


4.1.    Simple Credit Decomposition (Decomposition 1)
We start with the simple credit market identity described in equation (3.1) and operate a
log-transformation so as to make this decomposition additive:

                                   log(Ct ) = log(Nt ) + log(c̄t ).                                 (3.4)


We detrend our aggregate credit variables using the HP filter with a smoothing parameter
of 1600. The standard deviation of detrended aggregate credit (in log) is 2.58%, while the
standard deviation of the number of relationships is 1.14%, and that of average credit per
relationship is 1.93%. The correlation of aggregate bank credit with the two latter series is
0.71 and 0.91, respectively.
  29
     Using loan-level Japanese data, Nakashima and Takahashi (2018) link relationship destruction rates to
bank capital constraints and show that these are more prevalent for younger matches.




                                                   176


4.2.    Secular Trends
Figure 3.9 reports the long-run trends associated with our three variables of interest (in logs).
The trends show a significant increase (about 50%) in aggregate credit (in real terms) over
the past 20 years. Interestingly, this pattern has been accompanied by an almost equivalent
increase in relationship capital (about 45%) and a minimal increase in average credit per
match (about 5%, which corresponds to the average credit rising from about 977 thousand to
1.02 million EUR from 1999 through 2016). In fact, while the trend in the intensive margin
was relatively evident in the first half of the sample (+12%), the advent of the financial
crisis has led to a gradual decline over the period 2008-2017 and thus an overall negligible
contribution to aggregate credit in the long run.

This relative stability of the average credit per match may suggest that firm size composition
and corresponding financing needs also remained stable throughout the sample period.30
Hence, such finding establishes that low-frequency changes in the number of relationships
may be the dominant force for long-run fluctuations in aggregate credit. As a consequence,
policies that aim to boost aggregate credit in the long run may be more effective when
targeting structural changes that impact the matching process between borrowers and lenders
and gross relationship flows in general.


4.3.    Cyclical Fluctuations
We now move on to the cyclical properties. Here we start with a simple and straightforward
approach based on first differences before complementing it with an analysis of log-deviations
from the HP trend.

First-difference Approach

Based on the identity derived in (3.4), we can apply a first difference between time t and
t + 1 to get:

              ∆ log(Ct+1 ) = log(Ct+1 ) − log(Ct ) = ∆ log(Nt+1 ) + ∆ log(c̄t+1 ),                   (3.5)

where ∆Xt+1 = Xt+1 − Xt . Figure 3.10(a) illustrates the evolution of the aggregate credit
(log-growth) in addition to its two extensive and intensive margin components over the sam-
ple period. For the most part, the large credit declines observed during crisis periods are
due to the joint effect of both margins. In addition, the extensive margin seems to exhibit a
  30
    Note that only a small fraction of firms relies on more than one relationship; thus, the average credit
per match is a reasonable proxy for the total credit per given firm.


                                                   177


“smoother” pattern and maybe a slower reaction over time, which highlights possible differ-
ences in adjustment behaviors and costs for each margin. In addition, such decomposition
can also help characterize credit recoveries. For example, the nearly creditless recovery ob-
served in 2010-2012 was due to a relatively subdued average credit per bank-firm pair, while
the number of bank-firm relationships was actually growing over the same period. We further
elaborate on these crisis/recovery patterns in Section 5.

Interestingly, given that the log-transformation allows for the extensive and intensive margins
to be additively separable, we can write a linear decomposition of the variance of total credit
flows in the spirit of Fujita and Ramey (2009) and formally quantify the contribution of each
margin, as follows:

         var(∆ log(Ct )) = cov(∆ log(Nt ), ∆ log(Ct )) + cov(∆ log(c̄t ), ∆ log(Ct )).    (3.6)


Ultimately, we can write:

                                     cov(∆ log(Nt ), ∆ log(Ct ))
                            βExt =                                  ,
                                          var(∆ log(Ct ))
                                     cov(∆ log(c̄t ), ∆ log(Ct ))
                            βInt   =                              ,
                                         var(∆ log(Ct ))

with βExt + βInt = 1.

Moreover, we can rewrite the change in relationship capital (in logs) in terms of flow rates:

                     ∆ log(Nt ) = log(1 + nt ) ' 1 + nt = 1 + ct − dt .                   (3.7)


Assuming that nt is relatively small, we can derive the following first-order approximation
to further decompose the contribution of the extensive margin into creation and destruction
components:

                   var(log(1 + nt )) ' var(nt )cov(ct , nt ) + cov(−dt , nt ),            (3.8)

where ct , and dt are the credit relationship creation and destruction rates, respectively, and




                                              178


thus obtain:

                                 cov(∆ log(Nt ), ∆ log(Ct ))
                        βExt '
                                       var(∆ log(Ct ))
                                 cov(ct , ∆ log(Ct )) cov(−dt , ∆ log(Ct ))
                               =                     +                      .
                                   var(∆ log(Ct ))      var(∆ log(Ct ))
                                 |        {z        } |        {z         }
                                             βc                        βd



Panel A in Table 3.5 reports the results of this variance decomposition. The intensive
margin accounts for 73% of the total credit variation while the extensive margin accounts
for the remaining 27%. In addition, positive flows drive the bulk of the variation in the
extensive margin, while negative flows are much less important. With the first-difference
decomposition, we also note that the contribution of negative flows reduces, rather than
increases, the variance of credit, as gross flows trend downward throughout the sample
period. Once we detrend flow variables, we see that negative flows have a negligible impact
on the extensive margin and aggregate credit more generally.

HP Filter Approach

We complement these results by studying cyclical deviations from HP trends. Table 3.4 re-
ports the correlation structure while Figure 3.10 illustrates the evolution of the two margins
for both the first-difference and HP filter approaches.31 As shown earlier, the relative contri-
butions are about one quarter for the extensive margin and three quarters for the intensive
margin (Panel B in Table 3.5). We highlight that a non-negligible number of quarters with
minor fluctuations in aggregate credit may actually be experiencing counteracting extensive
and intensive margin effects. Furthermore, the relatively low correlation between extensive
and intensive margins (0.25 based on log-growth, and 0.46 for log-deviations) also suggests
that each component responds differently to aggregate shocks.

        lationships and the Importance of the Sub-extensive Margin (Decompo-
        sition 2)
Next, we complement our first decomposition with alternative and more refined versions in
order to account for heterogeneity across incumbent, new, and severed bank-firm relation-
  31
    While the decomposition into extensive/intensive margins remains straightforward, disentangling the
respective effects of gross relationship flows requires additional derivations and approximations, detailed in
the Online Appendix.

ships, which is prevalent across our data. We define and quantify the role of the sub-extensive
margin and show that it further amplifies the distinctive features of extensive and intensive
margins.

In order to justify the role of the sub-extensive margin, we first show in Figure 3.11 that the
average credit size of entering and exiting borrowers corresponds to about 50% and 40% of
that of the average incumbent, respectively. Moreover, this credit ratio for new borrowers
is volatile and procyclical, consistent with theory in Boualam (2018). Similarly, the credit
ratio for severed relationships also exhibits a procyclical pattern, albeit with slightly less
volatility.32

We denote by nν , and C̄ ν , with ν ∈ {i, n, s}, the number of relationships and the average
credit associated with incumbent (i), new (n), and severed (s) bank-firm relationships, and
observe that we can write the total credit Ct at time t, based on (future) surviving relation-
ships (i.e., t + 1 incumbents), combined with credit lost from relationships severed between
t and t + 1. We can also write Ct+1 at time t + 1, based on the existing relationship (i.e.,
the same t + 1 incumbents) combined with the credit supplied to relationships newly formed
between t and t + 1. We can then formulate the following alternative decomposition of credit
flows:

                                                                     s

Figure 3.12 reports the corresponding time series, and Panel B in Table 3.5 reports the
decomposition results.34 The results for this decomposition show that the incumbent effect
accounts for 54% while the extensive margin (i.e., the combination of new-bank-firm and
severed-bank-firm effects) accounts for 46%. The approximative results obtained for the HP
filter decomposition confirm as well the relatively balanced contribution between the two
margins. Looking at the effects of new and severed relationships separately, we find that
their βs are 0.62 and -0.17 (0.57 and -0.17 for the HP filter approach), respectively. The
negative sign associated with βSevered , while surprising, comes in part from the fact that
the average credit of recently destroyed relationships is procyclical and the corresponding
fluctuations actually dominate those associated with the flow component.

In summary, we note that the extensive margin contributes significantly to aggregate credit
fluctuations at the business cycle frequency. In fact, through our first decomposition, we
estimate that such relative contribution is on the order of one quarter. When we also take

      While we report in the core part of the paper the derivations for the first-difference approach, the details
associated with the HP filter approach are in the Online Appendix.
   34
      Section D.3 in the Online Appendix presents a third decomposition (referred to as “gross intensive credit
flows”), which further disentangles the positive and negative flows within the intensive margin. Its results
(for both first-difference and HP filter approaches) are reported in Table 3.8 and are overall consistent with
the ones presented in this section.

into account the sub-extensive margin, and hence the extent of heterogeneity (in terms of
credit size) existing between incumbent and new or severed credit relationships, we see that
the relative contribution of the extensive margin is actually even larger and jumps to about
one half.


5.     Anatomy of a Credit Crisis and Recovery
We have so far highlighted the importance of both extensive and intensive margins in ex-
plaining fluctuations of aggregate credit. In this section, we trace out the anatomy of a
credit cycle by constructing the average cyclical fluctuations of our variables around eco-
nomic downturns with a focus on the second decomposition approach. The French economy
experienced four recessions over the period 1998-2018 according to the OECD: (i) 2001-2003,
(ii) 2008-2009, (iii) 2011-2013, and (iv) 2014-2016. Figure 3.13 shows the unconditional re-
sults while Figure 3.14 zooms into each recession period separately. The aggregate credit
time series we report corresponds to the sum of the detrended extensive and intensive mar-
gins. Here, all variables of interest are normalized to 0 at the onset of a recession and their
dynamics are then reported over the subsequent three years.

We see that aggregate credit gradually declines on average to about 7% three years after
the quarter of recession onset. This decline is equitably due to both extensive and intensive
margins, which fall by about 3.5% each. Interestingly, we show that the intensive margin
is the main driver of aggregate credit decline in the short-run, while the contribution of
the extensive margin is concentrated between the fifth and twelfth quarters. Both margins
appear to be particularly persistent and start reverting back toward pre-crisis levels only
after about three-and-a-half years.

With respect to gross credit relationship flows, we show that a typical recession is character-
ized by a sharp and prolonged decline in inflows that persists over the first four quarters. In
addition, inflows remain subdued for a relatively long period, recovering only halfway from
their pre-crisis level after seven to eight quarters. The persistently low level of credit supplied
to newly formed relationships further amplifies the role of the creation margin during crisis
and recovery periods. Conversely, outflows observe only a modest and short-lived increase
in downturns. The magnitude of their change is roughly one-sixth that of inflows and they
revert back to their pre-crisis levels in about four quarters. Furthermore, the relationships
severed during downturns in general consist of smaller loans relative to normal periods, which
further mitigate the impact of the credit destruction component.

When we zoom into each recession separately, we observe that the credit declines experienced

                                               182


have different origins, namely: (i) the extensive margin as in the crisis of 2008-2009, (ii) a
combination of extensive and intensive margins as in 2001-2003, and (iii) the intensive margin
as in 2012-2013 and 2014-2016.35 For example, in 2001-2003, when aggregate credit fell by
about 12 log-points over the ten quarters following its peak, the intensive margin declined
by eight log-points, while the extensive margin declined only by four log-points. Conversely,
the credit decline of about five log-points observed in 2008-2009 was explained principally
by the four log-point decline in the extensive margin.


6.      The Extensive Margin Channel of Monetary Policy
How does monetary policy impact aggregate credit dynamics through the lens of the extensive
and intensive margins? We address this question by estimating impulse responses using
the local projection methods of Jordà (2005). Throughout this section, we focus on the
extensive/intensive margins, as determined by our second decomposition approach, described
in section 4.4, and on the effects of monetary policy surprises over a horizon h from zero to
eight quarters. Our analysis is first conducted at the aggregate level. We then complement
our findings with micro-level results and further investigate how bank characteristics can
affect monetary policy transmission along both credit margins.

Let us denote by Yt the dependant credit variable. The general specification we use is as
follows:

                                     Yt+h = αh + βh Vt + ut,h ,                                       (3.15)

with Vt , the treatment variable representing the instrument for exogenous variations in
the monetary policy stance at time t, and the error term ut,h . The estimated coefficients
{βh }h=1..8 determine the cumulative impulse response path of the credit variables of interest
following a change in the treatment variable. Given the nature of the credit decomposition
(3.10), the dependent variable Yt+h stands for (i) ∆ log(Ct,t+h ) = log(Ct+h ) − log(Ct ) for
aggregate credit, (ii) hl=1 log(1 + αt+l  n                      s
                                              cnt+l ) − log(1 + αt+l cst+l ) for the extensive margin, and
                         P
              i               i
(iii) ∆ log(C̄t,t+h ) = log(C̄t+h ) − log(C̄ti ) for the intensive margin.
  35
     These results also extend to the first credit decomposition into relationship capital and average credit
per relationship, as reported in the Online Appendix.

6.1.    Measurement of Monetary Policy Shocks
Our analysis relies on the Eurozone monetary policy shocks constructed in Jarociński and
Karadi (2020) over the period 2002-2018. These shocks are determined building on the high-
frequency identification (HFI) methodology established in Gürkaynak et al. (2005). The
HFI approach is particularly useful given that short-term monetary policy, as reflected in
the Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA), remained anchored at the zero lower bound for
a significant portion of our sample period, and that monetary policy decisions are correlated
with macroeconomic conditions. The identified monetary policy shocks combine surprise
movements in the three-month to two-year EONIA swap rates. The surprises are tabulated
within short intraday windows surrounding policy announcements (30 minutes) and press
conferences (90 minutes) following the monetary policy meetings of the European Central
Bank’s (ECB’s) Governing Council. The identification assumes that changes in interest rates
and asset prices occurring within these time windows ought to be due solely to monetary
policy news.

Furthermore, the ECB’s transparent communication may convey substantial information
about both monetary policy stance and economic outlook. Such confounding information
can lead to counterintuitive results. As a result, Jarociński and Karadi (2020) disentangle
these surprises into “purified” monetary policy and central bank information components
by exploiting the differentiated reaction of stock market prices using the EURO STOXX 50
index and imposing co-movement restrictions into their VAR specification. The key idea is
that positive shocks attributed to “purified” monetary policy generate a positive response
to interest rates but a negative one to asset prices, while positive shocks attributed to
central bank information generate a positive response for both interest rates and asset prices.
Ultimately, our analysis delves extensively into credit responses to monetary policy shocks
associated with the“purified” monetary policy surprises.36 The shocks are aggregated from
the ECB meeting to the quarterly frequency to be consistent with the remaining variables
in the specification.


6.2.    Aggregate Response
We estimate the specification (3.15) for aggregate credit in addition to its extensive and
intensive margin components. Figure 3.15 reports the impulse response results based on
  36
    Figure 3.29 reports these time series in the Online Appendix. We thank Peter Karadi for sharing these
data with us.

the estimated {β h }h=1..8 .37 Panel (a) shows that a 100 basis point contractionary monetary
policy shock produces a gradual decline in aggregate credit, reaching about 20% after seven
quarters. Notably, our findings suggest that the bank lending channel operates through both
extensive and intensive margins, albeit with different sensitivities and timing, as shown in
Panels (b) and (c). The bulk of the credit variation appears to be driven by the intensive
margin in the short run, with the extensive margin’s response initially muted. Ultimately,
the effect on the extensive margin becomes more prominent between the fourth and eighth
quarters.

Finally, Panels (d) and (e) report differentiated responses for the creation and destruction
components of the extensive margin. More specifically, we show that monetary policy sur-
prises are channelled initially through the formation of new relationships and the average
credit per new relationship, and only start impacting the destruction side after five to six
quarters. This observation further confirms our earlier results that highlight the significant
role of creation flows, given that banks may have limited ability to sever credit relationships
featuring long-term loans.

One interpretation of the time lag between extensive and intensive margins is that it reflects
higher adjustment costs related to search frictions or information asymmetry associated
with the creation or destruction of bank-firm matches. As a result, monetary policy easing
conducted in the aftermath of a downturn could appear to benefit solely incumbent borrowers
through their existing credit relationships, at the expense of first-time borrowers. This may
generate inefficiencies in credit allocation and impact small- and medium-size businesses as
they delay entry decisions and access to credit.

Easing vs. Tightening Effects. We also test whether credit variable responses to mon-
etary policy are subject to non-linearities conditional on the easing or tightening natures of
the shocks, and run the following adjusted specification:

                       Yt+h = αh + βh1 × δT + βhE Vt + βhT δT × Vt + ut,h ,                         (3.16)


with a dummy variable, δT , that equals 0 for an easing shock and 1 for a tightening shock;
{βhE }h=1..8 , the estimated response to an easing shock, and {βhT }h=1..8 , the estimated response
  37
    We also report the results obtained for the Central Bank information component in the Online Ap-
pendix. We also provide further robustness tests. In particular, we highlight that our results are robust
to (i) introduction of two lags of monetary policy surprises as controls, and (ii) using shocks constructed
in Kerssenfischer (2019), with methodology that notably allows for a wider time window around ECB an-
nouncements and uses German Bund futures.



                                                   185


to a tightening shock.

Figure 3.16 shows the results. While the effects appear to be roughly of the same order
of magnitude at first pass, only the responses to tightening shocks are in fact statistically
significant. Thus, the overall effect of monetary policy shocks on total credit (-10%) is driven
mainly by the negative effect implied by tightening surprises, as easing surprises generate
non-significant increases in total credit.38


6.3.     Bank-level Response
Next we revisit our impulse response results and analyze micro-level responses using bank-
level information. The adjusted specification we use for local projections is as follows:

                                     Yi,t+h = αi,h + βh Vt + ui,t,h ,                                    (3.17)


with Vt , the treatment variable representing the monetary policy shock and the error terms
ui,t,h .

We estimate the above panel regression (3.17) and show the estimated cumulative impulse
responses in Figure 3.17.39 Overall, the estimated {β h }h=1..8 coefficients (derived based on
equal weights across banks) are estimated with tighter confidence intervals, given bank-level
heterogeneity. The results are qualitatively in line with those estimated at the aggregate
level, with the exception of the destruction component. At the bank level, we find that a
100 basis point contractionary monetary policy shock leads to an average decline in credit of
about 38% after seven quarters. This is due overall to a 14% decline in the extensive margin
combined with a 24% decline in the intensive margin. The notably different pattern for the
destruction component of the extensive margin (Panel (e)) illustrates potentially distinct
lending behaviors across the bank size distribution and suggest that smaller banks may
respond to monetary policy tightening by severing fewer credit relationships or relationships
that feature relatively small credit exposures, as opposed to larger banks.

What is the role of bank characteristics in the transmission of monetary policy shocks? We
take advantage of the bank-level approach and investigate the above results by classifying
banks into subgroups associated with (i) bank size, (ii) share of long-term loans, and (iii)
share of off-balance-sheet credit items. Banks are reclassified on a quarterly basis in below-
  38
     This result appears to be particularly strong for the period pre-2008. In fact, we show in auxiliary results
that simultaneous Long-Term Refinance Operations (LTRO) announcements significantly mitigate the effect
of conventional monetary policy surprises on credit.
  39
     The results are qualitatively similar when including bank fixed-effects, as shown in the Online Appendix.


                                                      186


and above-median groups. We re-estimate our local projection specification (3.17) and report
the corresponding results in Figure 3.18.

While credit variable responses appear to consistently follow similar paths across all sub-
groups, the magnitude of the effects can differ substantially. For example, banks that are
smaller, with fewer long-term loans, or with more off-balance-sheet credit exposure appear
to be twice as reactive to monetary policy changes relative to their counterparts. This effect
is visible along the intensive margin across all characteristics. It is all the more stark for the
extensive margin given that banks that are larger, with a large share of long-term loans, or
with a small share of off-balance-sheet items, exhibit only a muted response, as opposed to a
significant decline experienced by their counterparts. Thus, banks that retain sufficient flex-
ibility in their balance sheet may be able to react more swiftly to monetary policy surprises.
From a policy perspective, these banks may play a key role during credit recoveries. Indeed,
monetary easing rounds in the aftermath of an economic downturn could specifically benefit
incumbent borrowers of such banks, all else being equal. In a similar vein, these banks are
likely to expand their loan supply along their extensive margin and offer better access to
credit for first-time borrowers.

Taken together, our findings show that the extensive margin is critical in the transmission
of monetary policy to commercial credit. This result goes beyond the bank lending channel
literature, which typically focuses on the intensive margin. The extensive margin channel we
uncover is central for small banks and those with flexible balance sheets and ample lending
capacity.


7.     Discussion - Credit Reallocation and Theoretical
       Implications

7.1.   Credit Reallocation and Credit Market Fluidity
Trend. French credit markets have become much less fluid over the past two decades. As
shown in Figure 3.5, credit market fluidity, which we define as total reallocation flows (i.e.,
the sum of creation and destruction flows), has declined from about 15.4% to 11.8% during
that period, with the small credit segment and low-duration matches being particularly
impacted.

Exploring the determinants of this substantial decline in credit market fluidity is beyond the
scope of this paper. However, we elaborate below on potential contributing factors. First, a


                                               187


lower degree of reallocation can be interpreted as a slower arrival of new credit opportunities
and potentially longer credit search periods for newly created businesses. It can also be
viewed as resulting from higher switching costs for incumbent borrowers (with potentially
more monopoly rents extracted by banks), which can limit their ability to grow or to find a
banking partner that better matches their needs.

Various government policies and recent banking developments may also be at play in the long
run. These include bank consolidation, increased competition, tightened regulatory require-
ments, securitization, development of secondary markets, and improved creditor protection,
and can also relate to innovations in lending technology. For example, easier access to more
information, while lowering matching costs, might also prompt more precise screening, and
thus to tightened lending standards. This could lead to longer credit search periods for
firms, as banks become pickier, but could also generate a lower incidence of destruction of
bank-firm pairs as match quality improves.

Ultimately, it is unclear whether such a trend is a considerable source of concern without a
more refined exploration of bank-firm match quality and the reasons behind the reallocation
slowdown. More specifically, while an increase in duration can add value for a healthy credit
relationship, it could also be detrimental to the economy in the case of unhealthy ones. The
lack of credit market fluidity could also have indirect implications for firm entry if borrowing
is impeded and search periods are long, and for firm exit if capital remains allocated to
low-quality borrowers for too long, consequently hampering productivity growth.

Cyclical Properties. A substantial literature has focused on exploring the sullying or
cleansing effects of crises. Indeed, a procyclical reallocation is associated with a sullying effect
to the extent that lower-quality matches tend to last longer during downturns. In the context
of credit markets, this could materialize in the form of a firm’s decreased ability to switch
lenders as bank entry and competition decline in bad times. It could also reflect incentives
that certain capital-constrained banks have to prolong credit to distressed borrowers (i.e.,
zombie lending). Conversely, the cleansing effect associated with countercyclical reallocation
can emerge when bad matches (be they due to bad banks or borrowers) are severed and
capital is efficiently reallocated toward higher quality and more resilient matches.

In the data, we find that credit reallocation is procyclical while credit churning (i.e., excess
reallocation) exhibits mildly countercyclical dynamics. Table 3.2 shows that reallocation
is positively correlated with the growth rate of GDP, credit, and relationship capital. It
also shows that excess reallocation is negatively correlated with GDP (in both levels and
rates). It is, however surprisingly, overall uncorrelated with total credit or relationship


                                                188


capital over our sample period. This finding highlights the assumption that credit reshuffling
across firms and banks is a key mechanism and a potential determinant behind aggregate
economic performance. These results are in line with studies performed in other contexts,
such as Herrera et al. (2011), who show that credit reallocation is procyclical (from the firm
perspective), and Eisfeldt and Rampini (2006), who show that physical capital reallocation
is procyclical. A deeper understanding of these effects requires a more refined cross-sectional
analysis, which we pursue in Boualam and Mazet-Sonilhac (2021).


7.2.   Implications for Theories of Banking and Credit
Our results call for a deeper understanding of the process of credit intermediation and trade-
offs faced by banks along both extensive as well as intensive margins. This is critical for the
development of macro-finance models that appropriately capture credit dynamics.

Most macroeconomic banking models have so far focused on broad indicators such as ag-
gregate credit and interest rates as their central variables, and have rarely tackled the un-
derpinnings of credit intermediation and the aggregate implications of long-term financial
contracts. Thus, since these models typically assume one-period same-size loans to which
banks can make frictionless adjustments in response to shocks, they are unlikely to provide
economic grounds for the existence of credit relationship flows across firms or banks, nor
distinguish the role of bank-firm match heterogeneity. Given their quantitative importance,
we argue that a successful theory of aggregate credit fluctuations should take into account
both extensive as well as intensive margins, and carefully lay out the driving forces that may
affect them differently.

First, several mechanisms and constraints could potentially shape economic tradeoffs be-
tween these two margins. On the one hand, banks may be interested in making loans to as
many borrowers as possible so as to diversify idiosyncratic risk, learn more about their local
environment, or supply credit beyond the limited demand of their existing customers. On
the other hand, banks may be willing or simply constrained to focus on a small number of
important relationships, when borrower acquisition and monitoring costs, or the marginal
benefit of in-depth credit relationships simply outweighs diversification. In the same vein,
if credit relationships turn profitable only in the long run, banks may be willing to spend
extra effort to retain their incumbent borrowers, instead of creating new relationships. The
severance of credit relationships could also lead to the destruction of bank-firm-specific re-
lationship capital, which can be detrimental to both parties. This is the case, for example,
when the match quality cannot be transferable due to informational frictions or other agency
problems.

                                             189


Other constraints can influence the extensive/intensive margin tradeoff. For example, the
adjustment in bank credit is lumpy due to the very nature of bank-firm relationships and
loan contracts. This is the case for banks with long-term credit exposures that cannot be
reduced immediately following adverse shocks, but that may have some flexibility in partially
adjusting their short-term credit and credit lines.

Second, the credit relationship flows we uncover result from firms’ and banks’ search, ap-
proval, and rollover decisions. This provides a novel perspective on the intermediation pro-
cess in credit markets and the frictions therein. Thus, decisions related to the creation and
destruction of credit relationships, but also to credit market entry and exit, may themselves
be subject to time-varying costs linked to aggregate or idiosyncratic shocks and frictions
hindering swift adjustments.40

In the spirit of arguments laid out by Rogerson and Shimer (2011) highlighting the utility
of search models in labor, a search-theoretic approach can help make sense of empirical
regularities and make predictions about borrower flows between unfunded and funded stages
and across banks. It can also be useful in terms of the modeling of agents’ decisions and can
thus provide further understanding of the dynamics of aggregate variables (e.g., aggregate
credit, interest rates) that are typically analyzed in the context of models abstracting from
search frictions. For example, a decline in aggregate credit relationships may be due to
the fact that borrowers are not entering credit markets, are not searching intensively, or
are simply more picky with respect to lenders and corresponding contractual terms. On
the other hand, it can also be due to the fact that banks have implemented higher lending
standards resulting in higher rejection rates, or have decided to stop rolling over certain
loans. Such alternative possibilities would be difficult to identify and quantify in standard
banking models.

Search-and-matching frictions also provide new foundations for adjustment costs faced by
banks along the extensive margin, and thus a relevant framework that can generate some
dampening but can also further persistence in credit dynamics following adverse aggregate
shocks. Thus, when the formation of new matches is costly and shocks are small or transitory,
banks may focus on adjusting credit along the intensive margin. On the other hand, banks
may ultimately downsize their relationship portfolio when subject to more severe or per-
manent shocks. This could lead to the severance of relationships, the loss of match-specific
capital, and more persistent effects, especially when relationships are time-consuming and
costly to rebuild.
  40
    If credit relationships were homogeneous and banks could adjust them symmetrically and frictionlessly,
then studying relationship flows may not be of the first order, but this is not the case.

8.     Conclusion
Our analysis highlights the role and importance of the extensive margin in aggregate credit
fluctuations. The methodology we develop for relationship flows extends that of labor re-
search to account for the specificities of credit markets and is applicable to the study of other
markets and countries with available credit register data. We view our empirical approach
and dataset as a novel laboratory and as a first step toward uncovering more properties of
credit relationships and their aggregate implications.

While we focus mostly on establishing stylized facts and identifying the distinctive features of
extensive/intensive margins, we believe that fleshing out the potential economic mechanisms
behind these dynamics can provide additional connections to the macro-finance literature,
and in particular the role played by collateral and bank balance-sheet channels.

More broadly, given the key role played by the extensive margin of credit along the business
cycle frequency and in the long run, this analysis raises the issue of whether banking models
abstracting from such a quantitatively important dimension provide a reasonable bench-
mark for the study of aggregate credit fluctuations. Thus, building models that account
for both margins is, in our opinion, critical when thinking about bank credit. We leave the
implications of these arguments for future research.

parameter of 1600. All nominal credit variables are deflated using the French GDP deflator,
deseasonalized using the X-13 seasonal adjustment procedure, and smoothed based on MA(-
1, 1).

             Table 3.5: Variance Decomposition: Intensive vs. Extensive Margins
This table reports the results of variance decompositions of aggregate credit fluctuation over
the period 1999-2016. The intensive/extensive margin decompositions are derived based on
first-differences (Panel A) and log-deviations from trend (Panel B) obtained from an HP
filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. All nominal credit variables are deflated using
the French GDP deflator, deseasonalized using the X-13 seasonal adjustment procedure, and
smoothed based on MA(-1, 1).

Notes: These figures represent potential situations for bank-firm (b+f) match data entries and the cor-
responding definitions for credit relationships and gross flows. We consider that a credit relationship is
“contiguous” as long as the data entries are available with a reporting gap below 4 quarters (cases (a)
and (b)). When the reporting gap is above 4 quarters, we consider that the bank-firm entries generate 2
non-contiguous credit relationships with independent creation and destruction dates (case (c)).

Notes: Panel (a) shows raw net (solid black line) and gross flows of credit relationships. Gross creation
flows (inflows) are reported in dashed black line, while gross destruction flows (outflows) are reported in
dashed gray line. Panel (b) shows the time series for cyclical deviations corresponding to the same three
variables after applying an HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Our sample period is 1999-2016.
Results are based on relationships above the reporting threshold (adjusted for inflation). Time series of
relationship flows are first deseasonalized using the X-13 seasonal adjustment procedure and smoothed out
using MA(-1,1). Gray-shaded areas correspond to recession periods.

of new relationships multiplied by the average credit supplied to new firms minus the number of exiting
relationships multiplied by the average credit supplied to exiting firms. Nominal variables are deflated using

Notes: These figures report the unconditional evolution of (i) aggregate credit, intensive, and extensive
margins capital (top panel), and that of (ii) net and gross flows (bottom panel) over the fourteen quarters
following the onset of a recession. The intensive/extensive margins are constructed based on the refined
credit decomposition 2 specified in equation (3.10). The aggregate credit dynamics reported are based on
the sum of the extensive and intensive margins. All variables are normalized to 0 based on the timing of the
pre-recession peak for aggregate credit, and reported in terms of log-deviations from their corresponding HP
trend obtained with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Gray-shaded areas correspond to the average recession
period.

Notes: These figures report the evolution of (i) aggregate credit, intensive, and extensive margins (left-
hand side panels), and (ii) net and gross flows (right-hand side panels) over the fourteen quarters following
the onset of each recession. The intensive/extensive margins are constructed based on the refined credit
decomposition 2 specified in equation (3.10). The aggregate credit dynamics reported are based on the sum
of the intensive and extensive margins. Due to their proximity, the recessions of 2012-2013 and 2014-2016
are shown combined in Panels (e) and (f). All variables are normalized to 0 based on the timing of the
pre-recession peak for aggregate credit, and reported in terms of log-deviations from their corresponding HP
trend obtained with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Gray-shaded areas correspond to recession periods.

             Online Appendix – Not For Publication

B.     Data and Variable Construction

B.1.    French Credit Register (SCR)
Our raw database excludes (i) sole entrepreneurs and (ii) all firms belonging to the financial
sector and public administrations. We keep only those firm-branch observations with non-
missing data on firm and bank identifiers. We also remove (i) observations for bank branches
located in Corsica as well as in overseas departments and territories, and (ii) branch-firm
linkages for non-resident firms. We then follow standard filters for firms within our sample
and delete observations for (i) various legal firm categories under French civil, commercial,
or administrative law that are irrelevant for our analysis (e.g., parishes, unions, cooperatives,
etc.); and (ii) financial and insurance companies, public administration, and various liberal
professions. Finally, we allocate banks in our sample to a unique banking group identifier:
we drop all banks that belong to nontraditional banking groups or non-credit intermediaries
(e.g., public banks and financial institutions).


B.2.    Balance Sheet Data (FIBEN & BRN)
We use two different datasets to gather information on French firms’ balance sheets. First,
FIBEN (Fichier Bancaire des Entreprises) accounting data are extracted from the individual
company accounts. These are collected yearly through the branch network of Banque de
France based on fiscal documents (i.e., balance sheet and income statements). The data
collection covers all companies conducting business in France whose annual turnover exceeds
EUR 0.75 million or whose bank debt exceeds EUR 0.38 million. We exploit this database to
obtain relevant firm-level variables such as firm total assets, leverage, and employment. The
dataset also provides information about the age of the firm, its 2-digit industry, and whether
it is part of a group or a standalone company. It also contains a unique firm identifier
that allows data to be merged with the SCR. Second, the BRN (Benefices Industriels et
Commerciaux - Regime Normal ) dataset is produced by the INSEE (Institut National de la
Statistique et des Etudes Economiques) and gathers the balance sheet information of firms
that opt for the standard fiscal regime. It provides information on employment, sales, value
added, and the breakdown of investment for all firms of all sectors from 1998 through 2016.

B.3.    Banking Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As)
In order to keep track of bank M&As, we rely on data from the French Supervision and
Prudential Authority (ACPR). Our dataset gathers all the M&A operations involving banks
located within the French territory and includes the date of the transaction as well as the
identity of acquiring and acquired banks.


B.4.    Public Banks
Due to their “nonstandard” objectives, we remove the following public banks from the sam-
ple:

   • Caisse nationale des Telecom (Bank identifier: 15379)
   • Caisse nationale des autoroutes (Bank identifier: 15389)
   • Groupe banque de development des PME (BPI (initially titled OSEO), with bank iden-
     tifiers: 10048, 13328, 13810, 13880, 14138, 18710, 19510, and 18359)
   • Groupe CDC (Bank identifiers: 23930, 40031, 60030, and 60070)
   • Groupe credit logement (Bank identifier: 19230)


B.5.    Other Reporting Issues
The reporting methodology of the SCR has evolved constantly over the past two decades.
We document here some of the issues that directly impact our tabulations and our cor-
responding adjustment. For example, in 2003Q3, the French Central Bank credit grading
scale was amended (going from cotation BDF to cotation NEC ); we use a correspondence
table provided by Banque de France to ensure a consistent measure of the credit quality of
borrowers. In 2012Q1, the reporting of non-performing loans was modified, which creates
a minor discontinuity in some of our aggregate series. All the non-performing credit was
indeed previously allocated to long-term credit (even if the maturity was shorter than one
year), but after 2011Q4 its reporting was broken down into long-term and short-term cate-
gories. This evolution directly affects our measures of the number of existing relationships
with short-term vs. long-term credit. We decided to artificially keep the pre-2012 norm
active until the end of our sample and to re-classify relationships based on their initial ma-
turities. Finally, and despite our efforts, we were unable to properly deal with a change in
the reporting methodology for credit guarantees, occurring at the end of 2005, that led to a
spike in gross flows around 2005Q4 and 2006Q1. For each gross flow time series, we manually
replace this one data point at time t based on the midpoint derived from the time t − 1 and
t + 1 data. That said, working with this data point or simply omitting it from the analysis

C.       Credit Relationship Flows – Additional Descriptive
         Results and Robustness Checks
Cross-section. Table 3.6 reports additional summary statistics in the cross-section. We
note that overall there is a significant degree of heterogeneity across banks, firms, and bank-
firm matches, further highlighting the importance of jointly analyzing the extensive and
intensive margins of credit.41 For example, bank size (as measured by the number of ser-
viced borrowers or total credit exposure) is heavily skewed with a median of 77 borrowers (or
equivalently EUR 137 million), with the 95t h percentile standing at over 4000 borrowers (or
EUR 3.8 billion). In the same vein, relationship duration and credit exposure measures also
exhibit a large degree of dispersion across relationships, with interquartile ranges spanning
5.9-24.4 quarters, and 116-429 thousand EUR, respectively.

This table reports cross-sectional summary statistics for the period 1999Q1-2016Q4. Re-
lationship duration is measured in quarters. All credit variables are in thousands of Euro
unless specified otherwise and are deflated using the French seasonally adjusted GDP Im-
plicit Price Deflator obtained from the FRED database. We display the mean, 25th, 50th,
75th, 95th, and 99th percentiles for all variables over the sample period.

     On the one hand, if bank-firm matches were all identical and financial contracts were rigid (i.e., credit
per match is constant throughout the relationship), then we should care only about counting the number
of credit relationships in the economy (i.e., extensive margin would be a sufficient statistic for aggregate
credit). On the other hand, if the processes behind the creation and destruction of bank-firm matches were
frictionless and the value/quality of the relationship portable, then only the intensive margin would matter.

                     Table 3.7: Cyclical Properties: Lead-lag Structure
This table reports the results for cross-correlation of leads (+2 to +8) and lags (-8 to -2)
for detrended credit relationship flows, relationship capital, and average credit with respect
to GDP, total credit, relationship capital, and average credit, over the period 1999-2016.
GDP, total credit, relationship capital, and average credit refer to the log-growth of these
variables. Flow variables are detrended using an HP filter with a smoothing parameter of
1600. Nominal credit variables are deflated using the French GDP deflator, deseasonalized
using the X-13 adjustment procedure, and smoothed based on MA(-1, 1).

D.      Extensive/Intensive Margin Decompositions – Ad-
        ditional Derivations and Results

D.1.    Simple Decomposition
This section provides additional derivations related to the variance decomposition of aggre-
gate credit, based on the HP-filtered cyclical log-deviations. We start with the following
identities:

                                 log(Ct ) = log(Nt ) + log(c̄t )
                                 log(C̃t ) = log(Ñt ) + log(c̄˜t ).

We can thus write:

                             ∆ log(Ct ) = log(Ct ) − log(C̃t )
                                          = ∆ log(Nt ) + ∆ log(c̄t ),                   (3.18)


where X̃ is the HP-filtered trend and ∆Xt = Xt − X̃t correspond to the cyclical deviations.
We can then determine the associated betas based on this decomposition, similar to the one
derived in Equations (12 - 15):

                       cov(∆ log(Nt ), ∆ log(Ct )) cov(∆ log(c̄t ), ∆ log(Ct ))
                1 =                               +
                            var(∆ log(Ct ))            var(∆ log(Ct ))
                     = βExt + βInt .


Furthermore, we can write the following recursive expression connecting the cyclical devia-
tions of the number of relationships to those of gross flows:

         ∆ log(Nt+1 ) = log(Nt + P ost+1 − N egt+1 ) − log(Ñt + P˜ost+1 − N˜eg t+1 )
                      = ∆ log(Nt ) + log(1 + ct+1 − dt+1 ) − log(1 + c̃t+1 − d˜t+1 ),   (3.19)


where P ost and N egt correspond to positive and negative relationship flows (in level) at
time t. We can then iterate this relationship up until the time origin and rewrite the cyclical

Notes: This figure shows a scatter plot of the cyclical deviations (in log) of average credit and the stock of
relationship, as a function of their aggregate credit counterparts. Cyclical deviations are extracted using an
HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Nominal variables are deflated using the French seasonally
adjusted GDP Implicit Price Deflator obtained from the FRED database. Results are based on relationships
above the reporting threshold (adjusted for inflation). Time series of relationship flows are first deseasonalized
using the X-13 seasonal adjustment procedure and smoothed out using MA(-1,1). Our sample period is 1998-
2016.

D.3.    A Third Decomposition: Gross Intensive Credit Flows (Decomposition
        3)
We finally present another alternative decomposition allowing for the distinction between
positive and negative (intensive) credit flows for incumbent, new, and severed relationships.
This version is based on gross intensive flows, rather than on “pure” extensive vs. inten-
sive margin. It is somewhat close to decomposition 2, although it comes with some minor
adjustments. We start with the following identity:

                    Ct+1 = Ct + P osit+1 + P osnt+1 − N egt+1
                                                          i         s
                                                              − N egt+1 ,                (3.24)

where P osit and N egti represent positive and negative flows of incumbent credit relationships,
while P osnt represents positive flows associated with new relationships, and N egts represents
the negative flows associated with newly severed ones.

We can then derive the log-growth in credit as:
                                                             i
                                     P osit+1 P osnt+1 N egt+1           s
                                                                   N egt+1
              ∆ log(Ct+1 ) = log(1 +         +        −         −          )
                                        Ct       Ct        Ct        Ct
                                                         i
                                 P osit+1 P osnt+1 N egt+1         s
                                                               N egt+1
                           ' 1+          +        −         −          .                 (3.25)
                                    Ct        Ct       Ct        Ct

And, similar to previous decompositions, we get:

                          1 ' βPosi + βNegi + βPosn + βNegs .


For the HP filter approach, we can equivalently write:

                                                          i

 Table 3.8: Variance Decomposition: Intensive vs. Extensive Margins (Decomposition 3)

This table reports the results for variance decompositions of aggregate credit fluctuations
over the period 1999-2016. The intensive/extensive margin decompositions are derived based
on first-differences and log-deviations from trend obtained from HP filter with a smoothing
parameter of 1600. All nominal credit variables are deflated using the French GDP deflator,
deseasonalized using the X-13 seasonal adjustment procedure, and smoothed based on MA(-
1, 1).

Notes: This figure shows a scatter plot of the cyclical deviations (in log) of average credit and the stock of
relationship, as a function of their aggregate credit counterparts. Cyclical deviations are extracted using an
HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Nominal variables are deflated using the French seasonally
adjusted GDP Implicit Price Deflator obtained from the FRED database. Results are based on relationships
above the reporting threshold (adjusted for inflation). Time series of relationship flows are first deseasonalized
using the X-13 seasonal adjustment procedure and smoothed out using MA(-1,1). Our sample period is 1999-
2016.

Notes: These figures report the unconditional and crisis dynamics of the creation (new) and destruction

extensive margin is based on decomposition 2, specified in equation (3.10). All variables are normalized to 0
based on the timing of the pre-recession peak for aggregate credit, and reported in terms of log-deviations from
their corresponding HP trend obtained with a smoothing parameter of 1600. Gray-shaded areas correspond
to the recession period.

F.1.     Conventional vs. Unconventional Monetary Policy
Given the significant shift in monetary policy conduct over the past two decades, the infor-
mation conveyed by policy meetings has also evolved to include details about unconventional
monetary policy, with potential implications for both quantities and prices. Among others,
Long-Term Refinance Operations (LTRO) have been first announced in August 2007 and
used extensively throughout the financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. Here,
we focus on the effect of monetary policy surprises when Long-Term LTRO announcements
occur simultaneously. We use the event database for the ECB as collected by Cieslak and
Schrimpf (2019) to determine whether a policy meeting announcement makes a reference to
LTRO. We then run the specification (3.16), with a dummy variable δT , which equals 1 for
announcements referring to LTRO and 0 for those that do not.

Our results (Figure 3.33) show that monetary policy surprises, when combined with LTRO
announcements, do not generate a significant response for aggregate credit. In fact, the ex-
tensive and intensive margins appear to react in opposite, as a tightening surprise generates
a decline in the intensive margin but an increase in the extensive margin. While a formal
investigation of LTRO shocks is outside the scope of this paper, these results would simply
argue that (tightening) monetary policy surprises tend to have more significant effects on
credit when not confounded with simultaneous LTRO shocks.

Technology-induced Trade Shocks?
This chapter is based on a paper co-authored with Clément Malgouyres (IPP, PSE) and
Thierry Mayer (Sciences Po, CEPR).

                                           Abstract
In this paper, we document the presence of “technology-induced” trade in France between
1997 and 2007 and assess its impact on consumer welfare. We use the staggered roll-out
of broadband internet to estimate its causal effect on the importing behavior of affected
firms. Using an event-study design, we find that broadband expansion increases firm-level
imports by around 25%. We further develop a model where firms optimize over their import
strategy and which yields a sufficient statistics formula for the quantification of the effects of
broadband on consumer welfare. Interpreted within this model, our reduced-form estimates
imply that broadband internet reduced the consumer price index by 1.85% and that the
import-channel, i.e. the enhanced access to foreign goods that is allowed by broadband,
accounts for about 40% of that effect.

1.     Introduction

        rom 1995 to 2008, the value of imports by high-income countries has grown twice as

F         fast as global GDP.1 This acceleration of globalization has induced well-documented
          labor market impacts (Autor et al., 2016b, summarize the recent literature on the
impact of the “China shock” on labor market outcomes), as well as rises in consumer welfare
through lower prices and gains in varieties (see Feenstra and Weinstein, 2017, for a recent
illustration). This period was also characterized by radical innovations in information and
  1
    The World Bank World Development Indicators report that the ratio of imports over GDP for high-
income countries has grown from 43% to 61%.

communication technologies (ICT) and by their rapid diffusion throughout the world econ-
omy. It is most likely that the “ICT revolution” (Cohen et al., 2004) lowered the cost of
carrying out international transactions and contributed to raising the pace of economic inte-
gration.2 To the extent that ICT facilitated international trade, part of the consumer gains
induced by trade development should be attributed to the diffusion of ICTs. In this paper,
we test this proposition by estimating the effect of the diffusion of broadband internet on
the importing behavior of French firms from 1997 to 2007 and by developing a theoretical
framework to assess the impact of broadband-induced imports on consumer welfare.

Identifying the causal effect of technology on trade is generically difficult because of its endo-
geneity. The French data and context allow us to make progress on the causal identification
of how technology affects firm-level import behavior. In terms of data, we assemble a novel
dataset on broadband internet availability at the municipality level over the 1997-2007 pe-
riod and combine it with information regarding firms’ importing behavior. Regarding the
context, we exploit the gradual roll-out of broadband internet in France, which was staggered
over several years due to limited funding and completed primarily in order to maximize pop-
ulation coverage with only limited attention paid to local economic conditions. This setup
provides natural ground for an event-study identifying how ICT availability affected firms’
importing behavior.

We find that the local access to broadband internet leads to a surge in the total value of
firm-level imports. Our point estimate implies a 25% increase after five years. When applied
to our estimating sample and taking into account dynamic effects, the aggregate effect of
broadband expansion on the value of imports in constant dollars over the 1997-2007 period
was to increase its growth rate from 75% to 91%, i.e. 16 p.p. or 21%. Our results are robust
to several potential threats to identification. First, we find no evidence of pre-expansion
differential trends in outcomes. Second, while it is possible that broadband introduction
was systematically associated with contemporaneous local economic shocks, we show that
adding a rich set of city-level controls for local industry and income dynamics hardly affects
our estimates. Additionally, flexibly controlling for changes in local labor market conditions,
by including a large set of local fixed effects interacted with year dummies, barely changes
our estimates.

We further document changes in importing activities along several margins. We find that
the increase in the overall value of imports is primarily associated with an increase in the
number of flows and find no effect on the average value per flow (where a flow is defined
  2
   Development in ICTs, such as internet and cell phones, has also contributed to unifiying domestic
markets, in particular in developing economies (Allen, 2014).

as the combination of an importing firm, an origin country and a specific product). All
types of goods (intermediary, consumption and capital) are affected. We also find that
broadband internet has a positive impact on firm performance as measured by value-added
and sales. Importantly, the import-intensity of firms increases: the ratio of imports over
sales is positively affected as well as the share of foreign inputs in overall consumption of
intermediates.

Our paper focuses on the importing behavior of firms, an outcome that has been relatively
underexplored in comparison to exports (see e.g. Hjort and Poulsen, 2018). This focus is
motivated empirically by the fact that imports have been more dynamic than exports over
the period and conceptually by the notion that imports matter most directly for consumer.
Nevertheless, we present some empirical results on the export side. We find that broadband
stimulated exports albeit to a lower extent than import.

Our main results rely on regressions carried out at the city level. This level of aggregation
matches the level at which we have variation in exposure to treatment and allows us to
capture several margins (intensive margin, extensive margin—firms starting to import—,
entry of new firms) which would be missed by a firm-level panel analysis. Moreover, the
model we use in the last of the paper delivers naturally a city-level estimable equation for
sales and imports. We present firm-level estimates when exploring the heterogeneity of the
effect along a number of dimensions, some of which intrinsically defined at the firm-level
(size, sector etc.).

In the final part of the paper, we assess the welfare implications of our empirical findings
through the lens of a simple but general theoretical model of firm-level imports. We con-
sider a small open economy made of up of several cities. Firms vary idiosyncratically in
terms of productivity across cities and choose the cities that maximize their expected profits
(Suárez Serrato and Zidar, 2016; Fajgelbaum et al., 2019). We use the standard monopo-
listic competition cum CES demand setup for final goods so as to link firm-level sales with
(quality-adjusted) unit cost. On the production side, hinging upon Blaum et al. (2018), firms
combine labor with domestic and imported inputs. Our model features the sufficiency result
highlighted by Blaum et al. (2018): the firm-level domestic share of inputs fully characterizes
the contribution of imports of intermediates to the reduction of its unit cost. The general-
ity of the setup allows us to remain agnostic regarding which type of trade costs (variable,
fixed per destination or product, search friction etc.) is affected by the broadband internet
expansion shock. It also generates a very parsimonious framework for welfare analysis. The
overall effect of access to fast internet on the consumer price index and the contribution
of enhanced access to foreign inputs to that overall effect (which we refer to as the import

                                             249


channel ) are expressed as a function of two reduced-form estimates and three parameters
to be calibrated (either from descriptive statistics or from the existing relevant literature).
Under our preferred values for calibrated parameters, our event-study estimates imply that
broadband internet led to a price index decrease of 1.85%. The import channel contributed
up to 0.75%, i.e. about 40% of the overall effect. We complete this analysis with an extension
that considers the impact of broadband on exports and nominal wages. Results from the
extended welfare analysis indicate that the export channel played a much more limited role
than the import one in driving welfare gains from broadband expansion.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We start by relating our paper to several
streams of papers that have studied the links between technology improvements and trade.
We then present the data and institutional context in Section 3. We detail our empirical
approach in Section 4. Baseline results and robustness checks are presented in Section 5.
Section 6 analyses the heterogeneity of the effect by types of goods and sourcing country.
The section additionally presents findings on firm sales, value-added, exports as well as
import intensity (imports over sales and imports over overall intermediate consumption)
that are important inputs into the welfare analysis. The section presents results from an
heterogeneity analysis of the impact at the firm-level whose results are broadly consistent
with the notion that the impact of broadband expansion on imports operates through the
alleviation of informational frictions. In Section 7, we introduce a firm-level model of input
importing and derive the welfare formula allowing us to quantify the contribution of the
import-channel as well as the total effect of broadband internet on consumer welfare.


2.    Literature
This paper connects with several strands of the literature. First, it enriches the large liter-
ature regarding the interactions between trade and technical change. Second, it has impli-
cations for the origins of trade shocks whose effects have been extensively studied in recent
years. Finally, it contributes to the literature on firm international sourcing choices.

While technology is often mentioned as a force amplifying globalization, empirical evidence
on the matter appears scarce. For instance, in his rich account of the recent wave of glob-
alization and its interplay with technology, Muendler (2017) mentions the possibility of
technology-induced trade but does not cite empirical papers estimating the impact of ICTs
on trade flows. Baldwin (2016) argues that globalization over the 1990s and 2000s was
driven by information technology by lowering the cost of coordinating activities across bor-
ders. It boosted intra-industry trade between advanced economies and a handful of emerging

economies as multinational firms from the North moved labor-intensive tasks to the South.
Steinwender (2018) provides empirical evidence on the role of the ancestor of modern ICT on
trade during the 1800s by studying the impact of the telegraph on trade between the United
Kingdom and the United States. A possible reason as to why modern data causal evidence
on technology-induced trade is rather scarce might be related to the difficulty of measuring
technology availability at the firm-level that varies over time while simultaneously observing
trade patterns. Consequently, most studies documenting a positive impact of ICT on trade
are either at the country (Portugal-Perez and Wilson, 2012; Clarke and Wallsten, 2006) or
macro-regional level (Barbero and Rodriguez-Crespo, 2018).3

There are some recent exceptions that have documented the effect of technology using firm-
level trade and outsourcing decisions. Kneller and Timmis (2016) find a positive effect of
broadband internet on the export of services. Fort (2017) documents the firm-level relation-
ship between investing in an electronic-integrated network and outsourcing, either domestic
or international, of complex manufacturing tasks. In the context of developing African
economies and relying on survey data, Hjort and Poulsen (2018) show that fast internet
increases employment and that rising exports is one of the mechanisms explaining the up-
ward shift in labor demand. Most closely related to our paper is Akerman et al. (2018) who
estimate how broadband local availability affects the effect of distance on trade flows using
a panel of bilateral trade flows between Norwegian cities and foreign countries, building on
the identification strategy of Akerman et al. (2015). While their results display a signifi-
cant interaction effect between fast internet and distance, they do not find that broadband
increases significantly trade flows. Their coefficients are positive, although imprecisely es-
timated. We depart from these papers in several ways. First, we focus on the import side
with the aim of quantifying the welfare consequences of the broadband-induced variation
in imports. Second, we are able to document additional margins of adjustment of trade to
broadband expansion, notably the “sub-extensive” margin of imports (i.e. the number of
goods and origin-country imported by firms) that has been shown to be relevant in other
settings (Gopinath and Neiman, 2014). Third, while Akerman et al. (2018) frame their
empirical analysis in the gravity literature, aiming at explaining the distance puzzle, we
adopt a more agnostic approach and aim primarily at documenting the extent to which
technology-induced trade might have contributed to the recent rise in import penetration
across advanced economies. Finally, we combine our estimates with a simple theoretical
   3
    Several papers have recently documented the impact of trade on innovation, i.e. the reverse direction
of causality compared to our focus. Aghion et al. (2018) find that expanding exporting opportunities in-
crease the innovative activities of the most productive firms. On the import side, Bloom et al. (2016) find
that greater Chinese import competition from China is associated with higher firm patenting in a panel of
European firms while Autor et al. (2016a) find opposite results in the US case.

framework to quantify the impact of broadband internet on consumer welfare, relying on a
sufficient statistic approach. We focus on welfare and do not model explicitly the impact
of internet on the geography of trade.4 A limitation of our paper with respect to Akerman
et al. (2018) is that we do not observe firm-level adoption and therefore focus on local avail-
ability while they have access to information on broadband adoption from surveys. They can
therefore estimate the effect of adoption on trade while we focus on the reduced-form. Note
however that the reduced-form effect is relevant policy-wise as it is straightforward to in-
crease local broadband availability through policy intervention while manipulating adoption
involves more intricate interventions.5

Starting with Autor et al. (2013), a growing body of evidence, based on a local labor market
approach6 , has documented the impact of trade shocks from emerging countries—in par-
ticular China and Eastern European countries, see Dauth et al. (2014)—on the local labor
market outcomes (manufacturing employment, wages or employment rate etc.). Most studies
analyze the effect of trade or technology in isolation, treating the factor left-out as a poten-
tial omitted variable to account for. By contrast, Autor et al. (2015) attempt to “untangle”
the respective effect of trade and technology on several local labor market outcomes, notably
the decline in manufacturing employment in the USA. Their analysis, however, considers
sectoral aggregate trade flows as given. We instead make the point that the remarkable
increase in trade flows over the period is in part driven by concomitant technical change.
Moreover, we also find a large effect for imports sourced from Eastern European countries
and China, suggesting that the recent “trade shocks” from the 2000s were, in part, driven
by technological change. Our results echo the point raised by Fort et al. (2018) that in the
presence of technology-induced trade, it is delicate to disentangle the effects of technology
from those of trade.

A sizable reduced-form literature has documented that increased access to foreign inputs
lead to favorable firm-level outcomes, notably productivity gains (Amiti and Konings, 2007;
Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011). Most of the literature relies on trade liberalization episode
to estimate the effect of trade in inputs on firm-level outcomes.7 We contribute to this
   4
     Note also that our sample size is considerably larger due to the sheer number of municipalities in France
(about 35,000 cities versus 400 in Norway) thus allowing us to uncover effects that might be otherwise
impossible to detect.
   5
     See Andrews et al. (2018) for a cross-country empirical investigation of the numerous determinants of
ICT adoption by firms and their complex interaction.
   6
     This approach was pioneered by Topalova (2010) and Kovak (2013) who analyse the local impact of
trade liberalization in India and Brazil respectively.
   7
     In their recent assessment of the literature Shu and Steinwender (2019) review 20 papers, 15 of which
adopt a reduced-form approach. Among these 15 papers, 14 rely on variation in foreign input access driven
by trade policy reforms. The one exception is Juhász and Steinwender (2018) who estimate the effect of the


                                                    252


literature by using a new source of identifying variation (staggered roll-out of an ICT) and
implementing a transparent event-study design that is allowed by the longitudinal nature
of the data and the large number of local events. An additional contribution is to build on
recent theoretical results in the literature on firm-level importing (Blaum et al., 2018) in
order to translate our reduced-form estimates into an overall impact of broadband internet
on consumer welfare and to isolate the contribution of the import channel.

As such, our findings also relate to the theoretical and structural literature studying the link
between international sourcing, productivity and consumer welfare (Halpern et al., 2015).
As broadband internet is found to increase the share of spending on foreign inputs as well
as the variety of inputs, trade appears to be one of the mechanisms through which fast
internet boosted productivity and ultimately consumer welfare. The paper documents the
direct effect of broadband on firm-level outcomes, most importantly sales and value-added
(subsection 6.3). In order to quantify the import channel through which fast internet boosts
imports, we take our reduced-form estimates into a general model of firm-level importing.
Rather than specifying the model fully and estimating its parameters (as in e.g. Sandoz,
2017; Antras et al., 2017), we rely instead on a sufficient statistics approach (Chetty, 2009)
as first developed by Blaum et al. (2018) in the import literature.8 Our estimates combined
with the calibration of this model with French data implies that broadband internet allowed
for a reduction of about 1.7% in the unit cost of production and that about 25% of that
overall effect is related to the import channel.9
roll-out of the telegraph network on international trade. While the source of variation is similar to ours, the
context (19th century), the level of variation (cross-country) and the outcome differ starkly from our set-up.
    8
      These micro-results build on the seminal work of Arkolakis et al. (2012) that show that in a large class
of trade models observed changes in the share of domestic consumption, together with the price elasticity of
trade are sufficient statistics for evaluating welfare changes associated with a foreign shock.
    9
      Perhaps more incidentally, our paper contributes to the literature on the overall impact of broadband
internet (Bertschek et al., 2015) for a recent review. Previous works have notably documented the skill-bias
of the productivity gains of broadband internet (Akerman et al., 2015; Ciapanna and Colonna, 2019). Few
papers documented the local economic impact of broadband internet in France and no paper we are aware
of look at firm-level outcomes. In a set of two papers, Houngbonon and Liang document a negative effect
of broadband penetration, as measured by ratio of residential connections to the number of households, on
the local Gini coefficient over the 2009-2013 period (Houngbonon and Liang, 2017) and a positive effect
on service employment (Houngbonon and Liang, 2018). We instead focus on the period of expansion of
broadband availability that is driven by the gradual upgrading of the copper wire infrastructure over the
1999 to 2007 period.

3.     Data and context

3.1.   Context: the diffusion of Broadband Internet in France
The ADSL technology. The ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is a data com-
munication technology that enables fast data transmission over copper telephone lines (much
faster than what a conventional voiceband modem could provide). In the ADSL technology,
bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater towards the customer
premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Eligibility for ADSL depends on the
distance between the final customer (e.g. home or office) and the Local Exchange (LEs),
since the intensity and the quality of the analog signal decreases as it is routed over the
copper lines.

Local Exchanges are the telephone exchanges owned by the incumbent operator France
Télécom (later renamed Orange) into which subscribers’ telephone lines end. As of 2008,
there were about 17 000 LEs spread throughout the country. Initially dedicated to the tele-
phone network, LEs are essential for Internet users who subscribe to ADSL. LEs aggregate
local traffic and then direct it via the so-called backbone (i.e. higher levels of the network)
towards the world wide web. A key feature of the ADSL technology is that one can supply
high-speed Internet by upgrading the LE while relying on the existing (copper) local loop to
connect the premises of the final customers. The upgrading involves the installation of an
equipment inside the LE called a DSLAM (Digital subscriber line access multiplexer) that
is required in order to recover the data transmitted via ADSL on the local copper loop and
adapt it so it can be transmitted to the higher levels of the network (which are typically
relying on optical fiber). The upgrading of local LEs is the key source of variation we will
use in our empirical analysis (see section 3.2 for more details on the data).


The ADSL roll-out in France. The ADSL technology became popular during the 1990s,
as many OECD countries were planning the expansion of services related to information and
communications technology. In the early 2000s in France, the deployment of the technology
beyond France’s largest cities was slow. The causes for this staggered deployment are multi-
ple. First, France Telecom (FT), the monopolistic telecom supplier at the time and still the
main supplier today, was unsure as to whether it was going to be able to make the upgraded
infrastructure available to new competitors with a positive markup or not. The uncertainty
regarding the wholesale price FT was going to be able to charge made the firm reluctant
to upgrade LEs beyond the largest cities (see Sénat, 2002, p.230). This uncertainty was


                                             254


lifted after a series of decisions by the regulatory agency set the conditions of that wholesale
market (Arcep, 2002).

Moreover, at the same time France Telecom had to invest massively in upgrading its LEs to
ADSL, it went through an debt crisis which ended with what was essentially a government
bailout in 2002. One can find anecdotal evidence of the impatience of the French government
in accounts of Parliamentary debate (at the Senate) regarding the excessively slow expansion
of broadband internet (Tregouet, 2001) and the difficult cooperation between the French
government (the Ministry in charge of the Industry) and France Télécom.

Under the impulse of the government—which increased its stake in the firm during the
2002 bailout of the firm – France Telecom pledged in 2003 to cover 90% of the French
(metropolitan) population by the end of 2005, i.e. all local exchanges (LEs) with more than
1000 lines, for a total investment of 600 M euros (750 M euros in 2018 prices) (Telecom,
2003).

Between 2004 and 2007, local governments (called départements10 ) started to play a role
in subsidizing deployment and favoring competition among providers. Most relevant for
broadband expansion is the creation of a contract between local governments the “Plan
Département Innovant”. It is a contract whereby France Telecom pledged to equip all LEs
with more than 100 connections within a year in that département. The proclaimed target
of the plan was to raise the French population coverage up to 96% by the end of 2005 and
activate all the remaining LE by the end of 2006 (Telecom, 2003). About 50 departments
signed the chart in 2004 even though many experienced delays. This commercial initiative
was widely perceived as a way for FT to counter the direct involvement of départements
in broadband provision that was made possible by a law voted in 2004.11 We account for
the role of départements in our empirical analysis by carrying a within-département analysis
(we include département-year fixed effects throughout). FT claimed to have reached the
full coverage of all relevant LEs in July 2007 (Le Gall, 2007), covering 98% of the French
metropolitan population.

Overall, the account of the broadband expansion in France over the period suggests that
it was gradual due to uncertainty regarding the capacity of France Telecom to undergo
the investment until 2002. After 2002, with the strong impulse of the government, France
Telecom started covering more secondary areas with a focus on the overall number of lines
per LE with only limited attention paid to local economic potential. While accelerated, the
coverage remained gradual due to operational limits on the part of FT and took about 2

more years than anticipated in 2003.

Our main effects of interest are identified out of the gradual diffusion of the new technology
in different LEs over space and time. The question of what were the criteria for deciding to
“treat” one LE before another is of course central for our paper. It is the topic of a whole
section immediately preceding the results (section 4.2), where we present evidence that the
main determinant was the city-level population density, with no role for levels or trends in
the trade patterns of the city.

Finally, it is worth noting that several sources show that the ADSL technology, while pro-
gressively replaced by other technologies—notably direct access to the optic fiber or FTTO
(fiber to the office) –, is still the main way firms access the internet. In particular, based on
a recent survey, it appears that 73 % of SMEs use ADSL technology only as of 2016 (Arcep,
2016). Moreover it constituted not only a massive improvement in terms of speed (from 56
to 512kbit/s for a transition from a classical to first generation ADSL connection) but also
in terms of cost and time of connection.12


3.2.    Data
In this paper, we combine three main sources of information: a unique city-level dataset
on broadband internet availability, firm-level trade and employment, and firm-level balance
sheet information. We provide a detailed description of our data in the following subsections.
More details on the datasets used is provided in Appendix C.1.

Broadband internet data

The most novel aspect of our data is the (manually collected) date of upgrade to ADSL in
mainland France for each Local Exchange (LE)’s.13 The historical operator was compelled
by law to make this data available to other operators as well as websites allowing consumers
to gauge the quality of their line. The data was collected through one such website.14 We
additionally obtained data from the regulatory agency (ARCEP) regarding the geographical
coverage of each LE. The data documents the area of each census block (IRIS) that is covered
by a given LE. Each city in France is partitioned into census-blocks.

Combining both datasets, we construct a continuous measure of broadband access of city i
  12
     FT was providing services at 128kbits at a much higher cost (Badré, 2007).
  13
     Throughout the paper, broadband or ADSL refers to first generation ADSL that is associated with speed
of 512 kbit/s.
  14
     We were able to check with economists at Orange that our dates matched exactly their data for the
years within the sample (1999-2007).

at year t . This measure, which we denote Zeit , is a time-weighted percentage of area covered
in city i. It is formally defined as:
                                X # days with access in b since Jan 1st of t    areabt
                 Zeit =                                                      ×P                                              (4.1)

where b ∈ i denotes the census tracks included in city i.


Discretizing the variable. We see that Zeit is in principle continuous between 0 and 1. Zeit
will be equal to one if all of its areas have had access for the entire year. It will be equal to
1/2 if the entire city has had access to broadband over half the year t. While the continuous
measure is useful, as it allows to gauge the state of broadband availability taking the area and
time dimensions into account, we do not use it directly in our empirical estimations. Indeed,
regressing trade outcomes on this measures would assume that the effect of an increase Zeit
by, say 0.5, will be the same whether it stems from a coverage of the whole city over half
the year or an increase in half the city area of the entire year.As we do not have strong
theoretical reason to think that would be the case, but we still believe that the two sources
of information are valuable, we discretize the treatment status by setting treatment status
to 1 after the city experienced its highest increase in Zeit . Formally, we define the year of
treatment as ti0 = argmaxt ∆Zeit and discretized treatment status as Zit = 1{t ≥ ti0 }.

As seen from Figure 4.1 in practice the empirical distribution of Zeit is heavily concentrated
on 0 and 1 and accordingly Zit and Zeit are strongly related (ρ = 0.90). Another way to assess
the relationship between the continuous and discrete variables is to trace the evolution of
Zeit around ti0 . Figure 4.15 plots the coefficients of a regression of Zeit on a set of dummies
for each time with respect to ti0 . The results show a sharp increase between −1 and 0 from
0 to 0.4 and to 0.9 at +1. The coefficients are estimated with a very high degree of precision
which reflects the fact that Zeit while continuous in theory has most of its support in 0 or 1.

Accordingly, the discretization of the variable does not result in much information loss. It
is attractive as it allows us to use the more transparent event-study approach that will be
described in Section 4.15


Geographical description of broadband expansion. Figure 4.2 shows the roll-out for
all of France. Figure 4.21 in the Online Appendix focuses on a specific region (Occitanie)
in order to provide a sense of the large variation in treatment status over time at very
fine-grained geographical level. The dark areas represent a large degree of coverage (a high
Zeit ). In 2000, those are confined to the few major cities of France, surrounded by a large
majority of no-ADSL territories. By 2003, the treatment has largely spread to lower scale-
municipalities, although large parts of France remain dependent on the old technology. The
national territory is essentially “hole-free” in 2007, when almost all LEs have been dealt
with. Our empirical approach will take account of the fact that all cities are eventually
treated in our setup.

Trade and employment data

  (i) Firm-level trade data. The data on firm-level trade is produced by the customs of-
      fice, and compiles the exported values and quantities for each firm-destination-product
      combination over the period considered (1997-2007).
 (ii) Firm-level employment and location data. The administrative dataset DADS
      (Déclarations Annuelles de Données Sociales) comes from firms’ social security records.
      For the period 1997-2007 and for every establishment with at least one employee, it
      provides the number of workers, the overall wage bill and the city of location. This is
      an establishment-level dataset where a firm can have several establishments.
(iii) City-level covariates. Several covariates (population, share of college-educated work-
      ers, labor force) come from the 1999 census files aggregated at the city level and directly
      provided by the French statistical institute (INSEE) on its website. Additional covari-
      ates (number of households and overall tax income) come from tax authorities’ files
      aggregated at the city level (Fichier communal de l’impôt sur le revenu).

Balance-sheet data

We use a firm-level balance sheet dataset from France. The firm-level accounting information
is obtained from the BRN (“Bénéfices Réels Normaux”) dataset which contains the balance
sheet and income statement of all firms operating under the standard corporate income tax
regime. The BRN dataset gathers information on about than 600,000 French firms every year.
This dataset has been used in several trade-related papers dealing with French data (e.g.
Eaton et al., 2011; Mayer et al., 2014). We use this dataset to compute firm-level performance
measures (sales, value-added) as well as the relative importance of imports (imports-over-
sales ratio). These measures will be particularly useful when linking our empirical results to
the conceptual framework.

Construction of the estimating sample

We assemble those different data sources to construct a final city-level estimating sample.
We start with the administrative dataset DADS to keep in our working sample only mono-
city firms—i.e. firms whose all establishments are located in the same city. This is done
in order to precisely identify the impact of broadband internet availability on trade out-
comes (we want our treatment and outcomes to be at the same micro level). Indeed, while
broadband internet expansion may occur at different moment for a same firm which owns
several establishments in several cities, we only observe aggregate trade at the firm-level (the
firm headquarter) and not at the establishment-level. Keeping only mono-establishment or

mono-city firms addresses this potential measurement issue. Mono-city firms accounted for
40% of the total value of imports as of 1999. Table 4.1 presents descriptive statistics at the
city-level for our estimating sample. The average city hosts about 78 firms, 26% of which
on average belong to the manufacturing sector. Imports are positive for about 50% of ob-
servations. The ratio of imports to overall sales is equal to 5% on average. Its distribution
is highly skewed. Individual cities represent on average a small percentage of sales of overall
sales (0.52%). This provides indirect support to the notion that broadband expansion of
any given city is unlikely on average to have a major competitive impact on firms located in
other cities.

             timating sample for 18,332 cities over the 1997-2007 period (201,580 obs.).
             The cities in our estimation sample contain a total of 41,537 blocks. The
             share of importing cities is the mean of a dummy equal to one if at least
             one firm was an importer on year t in city i, and zero otherwise. The im-
             port share is the city-level ratio of the value of imports over sales


We compute the value of imports, the quantity of imports, the number of importing flows and
the number of different products imported for mono-city firms aggregated at the city-level
and for several geographic areas and products categories (as defined by the BEC). We merge
this trade database with broadband internet data. We then aggregate firm-level balance sheet
data from the BRN at the city-level and merge this additional information with our main
database—we restrict the BRN sample to single-city firms present in the DADS. Finally, we
use firm-level employment and location data, data on population, share of college educated
workers, labor force from the 1999 census files as well as number of fiscal households and
overall fiscal income from fiscal files aggregated at the city level to construct a large fiscal
and demographic control database that we merge with our trade working sample. We keep
cities that do not undergo a change in geography over the period.

4.      Empirical approach

4.1.     Baseline specification
Because all spatial units are ultimately treated, i.e. connected to broadband internet over
the period we consider, we use the timing of treatment (staggered over time) in order to
identify the main effects of interest. We estimate a dynamic specification where we allow the
effect on a city i / year t, to vary with time-from-treatment. The year of treatment for each
city is denoted ti0 . We index time-to-treatment with d (negative before treatment, positive
after). Our sample covers the years 1997 to 2007, and we restrict the set of observations
where d ∈ {−6, −5, ..., +4, +5}. The main estimating equation is as follows:

                               d=5
                                       βd × 1{t = d + t0i } + x0it δ + αi + ψr(i),t + εit ,
                               X
                      Yit =                                                                                (4.2)
                               d=−5
                               d6=−1


where αi and ψr(i),t are fixed effects for the city and for the département (of the city)-year,
and x0it is a vector of time-dependent city-level covariates. We drop two indicator variables for
d = −6 and d = −1. That restriction is necessary to avoid multi-collinearity and to identify
the fully-dynamic underlying data generating process in the staggered design (Borusyak and
Jaravel, 2017; Gross et al., 2018). To ensure that this restriction is not influential in our
results, we display results with alternative normalizations in the robustness section.16

The specification presented in equation (4.2) includes leads and lags. The inclusion of leads
allows us to assess the presence of pre-trends. We also estimate a simpler “semi-dynamic”
specification where only the lags of the treatment are included, as presented in equation
(4.3):

                               d=5
                                     βd × 1{t = d + t0i } + x0it δ + αi + ψr(i),t + εit .
                               X
                       Yit =                                                                               (4.3)
                               d=0


The event-study coefficients βbd estimated from equation (4.2) can be interpreted causally
under the identifying assumption that, conditional on receiving broadband over the period
considered and conditional on city fixed-effects, the timing of broadband roll-out is unrelated
to the outcome. The presence of systematic local factors that would drive both broadband
and trade would be cause for concern. This potential issue is investigated by assessing the
  16
   We assess the sensitivity of our results to binning the coefficients associated with period -6 to -4 together,
meaning to constraint them to be equal as in Schmidheiny and Siegloch (2019). Finally, note that the semi-
dynamic specifications are not subject to this under-identification problem.

sensitivity of the coefficients to the inclusion of a large set of controls and fixed effects meant
to account for city and well as local labor market shocks.


4.2.    Validation of the research design

Explaining broadband expansion. Our identification strategy hinges on the assumption
that the coverage of cities was mostly determined by city population density—which is mostly
fixed over time—and did not take into account underlying trends in trading / importing
activities. As a result, conditional on city and year fixed-effects, we consider the variation in
broadband access to be as good as random. In order to assess the validity of this assumption,
we explore the extent to which broadband coverage over time can be explained by different
types of lagged city-level covariates. We group those covariates into several groups:

   1. Density: population in 1999 per square km (log), interacted with a full set of year
      dummy variables.
   2. Industry dynamics: shares of employment in 10 economic sectors at t − 1 as well as
      changes in shares between t − 1 and t − 2.
   3. Trade: asinh(number of transactions), asinh(value of imports) in t − 1, changes in
      these two variables between t − 1 and t − 2.17

We estimate the following specification:

                 Z̃it = dens0it ρ1 + indyn0it ρ2 + trade0it ρ3 + FEi + FEr(i),t + εit ,                 (4.4)

where Z̃it is the time-weighed share of city i that is covered by broadband internet as de-
scribed in Equation (4.1). As we are mostly interested in the explanatory power of these
different groups of observable variables, we only report the R-square of each regression. In-
dividual coefficients can be found in the appendix.


Regression results. We start by regressing broadband internet coverage on all three sets
of observable covariates without including any time or city fixed-effect. As indicated in
Column (1) of Table 4.2, we obtain a R-square of 56% indicating that these variables capture
a substantial share of the variation in treatment status. Column (2) presents the R-square
of a two-way fixed-effect model including city and département × year fixed effects. This
   17
      The inverse hyperbolic sine function (asinh) is close to the logarithm function and allows us to include
city with 0 trade in the analysis. Amiti et al. (2019) is a recent example of a trade paper also using that
transformation.

model absorbs 78.6% of the variance in treatment intensity. Column (3) presents the same
model to which we add the 1999 measure of density interacted with year dummies. The fit
of the model increases by 2.6 pp and the null that all the coefficients of the density variables
are equal 0 are firmly rejected with a F-stat around 222. Interestingly, the set of industry
dynamics or trade variables barely increases the fit of the model (columns 4 and 5) and the
F-statistic of the joint test that all industry (column 4) or trade variables (column 5) are
equal to zero are fairly low, indicating that, conditional on city and province-year fixed effect,
they are roughly unrelated to the timing of internet coverage. Column (6) shows that the
F statistics associated with the null hypothesis that all the industry and trade variables are
null is small (2.5) and two orders of magnitudes smaller than that associated with population
density (224). We consider the low predictive power of observable variables as supporting
our identification strategy, since a large share of the variation in timing of the broadband

   and number of flows (levels and changes). Column (1) includes all of the controls without fixed effects. Individual coefficients are

Our baseline specification will allow for differential (linear and quadratic) trends in outcomes
based on initial density. We will further assess the sensitivity of coefficients to the inclusion
of observables and show that results are little affected by their inclusion. Naturally, this test
does not imply that unobservables are not biasing our estimated coefficients. However for
this to be the case, these unobservables should be time-varying, correlated with the timing
of broadband expansion and yet uncorrelated to the rich set of observable variables included
whose inclusion we show does not affect our estimated coefficients. While this remains a
possibility we cannot completely rule out, given the battery of robustness tests we provide,
we view it as very unlikely.

5.          Baseline Results
The main variable we consider is the value of (in logs) imports of goods by firms located in
a given city. We consider the overall value of all types of goods. We show the results for
different specifications and assess the robustness of the results. We then turn to different
margins of trade (extensive and sub-extensive margins).

Notes: This figure plots estimates for specification in equation (4.2— fully dynamic) and (4.3—semi dynamic). The sample
include all cities with a positive trade flow (import). The baseline specification includes 1990 population density at the city
level interacted with quadratic and linear trends. Other controls include: (i) sectoral shares in 1997 (nine sectors) interacted
with linear trend, (iii) the (log of) number of fiscal households and the average fiscal income in 1997 interacted with linear
trend and (iv) 1990 education level interacted with linear trend (share of dropouts). 95 % confidence interval are presented.
Standard errors clustered at the province (département) level. Full estimation results are reported in Table 4.6.


Figure 4.3 displays the main results of our paper, plotting estimated coefficients from Equa-
tion (4.2) (full results are presented in Appendix Table 4.6). The blue dashed line report
results from a “naive” specification omitting controls except for the city and département-
year fixed-effects. Estimates exhibit a flat trend before the event (i.e. the normalizing
measure of time since access d = −1) and a break in the trend after that. The coefficient

                                                              264


for d = 5 in that specification is 0.156 suggesting that the expansion of access to broadband
internet increased the overall value of city-level import by about 16%, 5 years after the period
of largest expansion (see column 2 of Table 4.6).

Given the relevance of density in the decision-making process leading to broadband expan-
sion, our baseline specification adds linear and quadratic population density trends to the
regression. The black line shows our estimates. Here again, we see no sign of a pre-trend
prior to broadband expansion contrasting with a steady growth afterwards. The estimated
effect after five years is substantially larger than in the naive case, with a coefficient of 0.249.

The coefficients displayed with a light gray line come from a third regression where controls
for dynamics in sectoral composition, population and income (levels) as well as initial educa-
tional level (share of college-educated) interacted with linear trend. Results are remarkably
stable to this inclusion and are very close to the specification including only density con-
trols. The estimated lead coefficients appear equally supportive of the absence of pre-trends.
Finally, the last set of coefficients plotted in red represent a semi-dynamic version of the
baseline specification. The regression should in theory more efficiently estimated –as the
number of parameters to be estimated is lower–, however the standard errors turn out to be
very close to the fully dynamic specification in practice.


We see that the estimated effects (independently of the chosen specification) are growing
with time since broadband internet expansion in a roughly linear fashion. The effects grow
in magnitude as time passes which suggests that they are structural and might affect the
path of the local economy and not simply its level. Given our reduced-form approach, this
pattern might reflect the combination of two effects: the time lag between local availability
of broadband and its adoption by firms as well as an internal lag between firm-level adoption
and changes in importing behavior. In the absence of data on local adoption by firms, it
is not possible to disentangle these two sets of effects. Our estimated coefficients reflect
the products of both effects which might explain this pattern of linearly growing effects.
Note that the time period included in our analysis ends in 2007. This choice is dictated
by the advent of the financial crisis which has a major negative impact on global trade
(Baldwin, 2009) and would add noise to the estimation.19 Unfortunately it limits our ability
to investigate the longer run effect of broadband expansion and whether it levels-off after a
given period of exposure.20
  19
     It is standard for empirical studies focusing on international trade to exclude the great recession from
their time window, see for instance Autor et al. (2013)’s seminal study of the China shock in the US.
  20
     Note however that documenting an effect at a 5-year horizon in a event-study setting is rather on the
upper bound of what is found in the literature. For instance, the seminal study by (Autor, 2003) bins effects

Magnitude of the effect. In order to give insights about the quantitative implications
of our findings, we construct counterfactual aggregate imports absent broadband expansion.
The counterfactual outcome is measured as the actual outcome minus the predicted effect
of broadband availability on the outcome, taking into account the dynamics of the effects as
captured by our semi-dynamic specification.

More specifically, we compute an average effect of broadband internet expansion for each
                    P2007        y                   y
year effect as bt =    t0 =1999 wt0 ,t0 βt−t0 where wt0 ,t0 represents the national trade share for
                                        b
outcome y measured in t0 for firms located in cities where broadband became available at
year t0 . Let us denote the vector of total French imports over time as yt . We postulate
that the observed trade flow is given by a baseline level yt (0) that would have occurred in
the absence of broadband diffusion multiplied by the predicted effect: yt = exp(bt )yt (0). We
obtain the counterfactual series by inverting this relationship: yt (0) = exp(−bt )yt .

We present two sets of counterfactual time-series in imports which corresponds to two dif-
ferent sets of weights w. The first is obtained by computing the weight for our estimating
sample, which contains single-city firm only. The weights therefore do not sum to 1 for any
given year but instead sum to the share of single-city firms in national imports.

The second approach normalizes the shares just mentioned so that they sum to 1.21 Ap-
plying the first set of weights implicitly assumes that multi-city firms were not affected by
broadband expansion in their importing behavior, while applying the second set is equivalent
to assuming that they reacted in the same way as single-city firms. Therefore we see the
first counterfactual as a lower bound while the second is more likely to be an upper bound.
Indeed, to the extent that multi-city firms are larger and might be able to invest in tech-
nology and commercial networks that decrease their reliance on broadband technology to
engage in international trade, the impact of broadband internet on their importing behavior
is probably lower than the same effect for smaller, single-city firms.

The results are displayed in Figure 4.4. The lower bound result suggests that the increase
in the real value of French imports, which was 91% over the 1997-2007 period, would have
been 15 p.p. lower without broadband expansion. The upper bound results suggests they
would have been 37 p.p. lower.

Notes: The actual trade flows (black line) is the value of imports of goods in France in 2000 dollar normalized to 100 in
1997. Counterfactual 1 is obtained by subtracting the predicted effect of broadband internet where the average predicted
effect is computed by using a weighted average of the estimated βd , for d ≥ 0 where the weights correspond to the share in
national imports of each cohort of single-city firm (i.e. all single-city firms for which broadband expansion occurs the same
year) measured the year of broadband expansion. The weights therefore do not sum to one and reflect the empirical importance
of the estimating sample. Counterfactual 2 is obtained by doing the same calculation, but normalizing the previous weights
so that they sum to one, thereby extrapolating the estimated effects outside of estimating sample onto all potential importers.
See Magnitude of the effect: for more details.




5.2.      Further Robustness checks
Local labor market dynamics. We saw above that including controls on sectoral employ-
ment dynamics leaves the results virtually unaffected. It could be however that our proxies
do not fully capture local labor market shocks. In order to gauge the sensitivity of our results
to the type of controls included, we control non-parametrically for any development at the
local labor market level by including commuting-zone × year fixed effects. Commuting zone
are defined based on a criterion of self-contained commuting and are the usual unit to study
local labor markets in France. The estimated effects are displayed in Column 5 of Table 4.6
and are extremely close to the previous ones.


Alternative normalization. In the main analysis we normalize β−6 and β−1 to 0. Here,
we experiment with a different normalization: instead of assuming β−6 = 0, we bin the co-
efficients associated with d ≤ −4 together, that is we assume β−6 = β−5 = β−4 . Results are


                                                                       267


displayed in Table 4.11. Again, focusing on column 3 (density controls only), the estimated
effect is very close to the one obtained previously (0.30 versus 0.25). Overall, results do not
appear sensitive to the choice of normalization.


Placebo inference. Bertrand et al. (2004) show that serial correlation can bias inference in
difference-in-differences studies leading to serious over-rejection of the null hypothesis. We
take this issue into account in our main analysis by constructing standard error that are
clustered at the level of the département. These standard errors should lead to unbiased
inference even in the presence of serial correlation within cities as well as cross-sectional
dependence in the error term across cities within département.

In order to validate the inference provided by our clustered standard errors (which are only
valid asymptotically) we implement Chetty et al. (2009)’s non-parametric permutation test
of βd = 0 for d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. To do so, we randomly reallocate the date of broadband
expansion across cities, within the same département, and proceed to estimate equation
(4.2). We repeat this process 2000 times and build an empirical CDF for βbd which we denote
Fb(). If broadband expansion has a truly significant positive effect on the dependent variable,
here log of import values, one would expect the estimated coefficient to be in the very upper
tail of the estimated empirical CDF based on permutations.

Denoting βb5M the point estimate obtained in Figure 4.3 based on the log value of imports,
we get 1 − Fb(βb5M ) = .0005. Results are presented in Figure 4.5. This p-value is smaller than
the one using the t-statistics based on asymptotically-valid clustered standard errors (0.001)
and confirm that the broadband internet led to an abnormally large increase in the value of
imports.22


Fixed-effect model with a continuous treatment variable. While discretizing the
continuous treatment measure leads to very little loss in information due the underlying
distribution of this variable (see Figure 4.1), our empirical setting lends itself well to a
panel regression based on the continuous treatment measure. Here, we check that a panel
regression based on the continuous treatment measure leads to qualitatively comparable
results. As expected, point estimates are smaller since they measure a shorter-run effect but
they are positive and significant at conventional levels of confidence (see Table 4.10 in the
appendix).23

Inclusion of multi-city firms. Our baseline analysis focuses on single city firms—that is
firms whose plants are located within a single city. This focus helps minimizing measurement
error in treatment status given that trade is defined at the firm level but broadband expansion
is defined at the city-level. This focus leads us however to discard a large part of the value
of imports—as single-city firms accounts for about 40% of total French imports as of 1999.
We check the sensitivity of our results to including multi-city firms.

The main difficulty is that we do not observe trade at plant or establishment level but at
the firm-level. Accordingly, it is not easy to allocate firm-level trade to locations for firms
with plants across several cities. We adopt two complementary approaches. The first one
attributes all of firm trade to its headquarters. It is essentially equivalent to assuming that a
firm is connected once its headquarters are. The second allocate firm-level trade to different
cities depending on the weight of each city in its overall employment.

Results are displayed in Figure 4.19 of the appendix. It shows broadly similar responses
when including or not multi-city firms with point estimates around 0.20 instead of 0.25
when focusing on single city firms.24
  22
      The same holds for β4 , β3 and β2 . Unsurprisingly, the null that β1 = 0 is not rejected with as much
significance but still above 5% (see Figure 4.18 in the Online Appendix).
   23
      We also experimented with an alternative long difference specification that compares the change in
imports from 1999 to 2007 between cities belonging to different groups of cohorts. As expected, we find that
growth in imports tend to be higher in cities belonging to cohorts that received broadband in earlier years.
Results as well as explanatory details of the approach are presented in Figure 4.25.
   24
      This is consistent with an attenuation due either to measurement error but also to the heterogeneity


                                                   269


Accounting for zero-flows. Our results so far do not include observations where the log
of imports are not defined because imports are null. As such, there might be an extensive
margin at the city-level that we are missing. A simple way to accommodate observations
where city-level imports are null is resort to the hyperbolic inverse function (denoted asinh) of
                                                                                     √
imports on a balanced sample of cities.25 Ashin() is defined as : asinh(z) = ln(z + 1 + z 2 ).26
The results are displayed in Table 4.9 of the Appendix. Coefficients are larger (0.50 for d = 5
instead of 0.25 for the baseline specification), suggesting a role for an extensive margin at
the city-level and supportive of the causal interpretation of the results. We will therefore
investigate in more details the margins of adjustment underpinning the overall positive effect
of broadband expansion on imports in a dedicated section.


5.3.    Intensive, extensive and sub-extensive margins
We have at this stage established a strong effect of broadband internet on the value of
imports at the city level. This pattern could be consistent with an increase in the number
of importing flows, defined as a firm-origin country-product combination, an increase in the
average value per flow or any combination of both.

Figure 4.6 shows the results on both outcomes for the baseline specification. It is clear from
those results that the average value per flow is virtually unaffected (coefficients are small
in magnitude and lack statistical significance) and that the effect on overall value is almost
entirely driven by the increase in the number of flows.

The increase in the number of flows could in turn reflect either an increase in the number
of importing firms or a rise in the number of importing flows per firm. We show that the
first impact (extensive margin at the firm-level) is small in magnitude (about 6%) albeit
significant (see Figure 4.7). This implies that the second effect, the “sub-extensive margin”
(Gopinath and Neiman, 2014), dominates: it explains most of the causal impact of broadband
internet on the value of imports.

Our findings therefore support the notion that broadband internet caused an increase in
import value, mostly by leading firms that were already importing to import more goods and
of the effect depending on size—see Table 4.3 in subsection 6.2 below. Note moreover that allocating trade
proportionally to employment among establishment results in some differential pre-trends, plausibly reflecting
the fact that headquarters matter most for firm importing decisions and that they tend to be affected by
broadband expansion a few years prior to establishments in non-headquarter cities.
  25
     For instance, Hjort and Poulsen (2018) use this transformation when studying how individual hours
worked are affected by the arrival of fast Internet. Amiti et al. (2019) is a recent exemple using this
transformation in an application aiming at quantifying the cost of recent US protectionist measures.
  26

This finding suggests that fixed costs play an important role in sourcing strategies (as in
Antras et al., 2017) and also that broadband internet helps to decrease such costs. The
value per flow being essentially unaffected, the increase in the amount spent on imports is
roughly equal to the increase in the number of varieties imported—if one defines a variety
as the unique combination of a product and a sourcing country as generally done in the

In this section, we present further results regarding the heterogeneity of the effects by origin
country and type of goods (subsection 6.1). We then present results on overall firm-level
outcomes, namely sales and value-added (subsection 6.3). The latter results will be key inputs

Origin-country. Figure 4.9 recalls the overall effect on the value of imports after five
years and then shows the results for different groups of origin countries. Overall, we fail
to detect statistically significant heterogeneity, although point estimates appear larger for
imports sourced from China and from Eastern European countries and somewhat smaller
for EU-15 as well as other high-income countries and the rest of the world.

Type of goods: capital, intermediary and consumption. Figure 4.10 shows the
overall effect on the value of imports classified in three different types of goods based on
the BEC classification: capital goods, consumption goods and intermediary inputs. Those
results display some heterogeneity between types of goods: the value of imports of capital
goods are strongly impacted while we find a smaller effect, albeit still positive and significant,
for intermediary inputs and consumption goods.

We document further evidence of heterogeneity when considering combination of type of
goods × origin country. The effects reported in Figure 4.20 of the appendix lack precision
to reject equality of effect across countries within a product category. However, focusing
on point estimates, we see that the results point to larger effect for China and Eastern
European (EE10) countries than EU-15 countries regarding consumption goods. Regarding
intermediate goods, the impact is higher for EE10. For EU15 countries, only capital goods
are found to be significantly affected.

The literature on endogenous growth provides theoretical grounds for the role of foreign
technology in enhancing domestic performance, notably through the import of capital goods
(Eaton and Kortum, 2001). Our results imply that broadband internet might have boosted
firm performance through that channel. To the extent that this channel is at work, one
would expect firms sales and value-added to be boosted by broadband internet. Before we

6.2.     Analysis of heterogeneous effects at the firm-level
Heterogeneity based on firms characteristics. In this section, we attempt to under-
stand better the mechanism at play by documenting the heterogeneity by sector and other
firm-level characteristics. While baseline regressions are based on city-level observations,
results presented here rely on firm-level regressions. Our estimation sample includes all
single-city firms with at least one positive trade flow (import) before Broadband Internet
access. In order to summarize parsimoniously the heterogeneity in the effect we present
here results based on a simple panel regression. The results are therefore most directly
comparable to those presented in Table 4.10.27

Table 4.3 documents heterogeneity in the size of the effect by sector and firm’s size and pro-
ductivity. Column (1) present the average effect associated with the continuous treatment.
The size of the effect is (+0.033) is comparable to what is city-level observations (+.049, see
4.10, column 4). Considering the effect by sector, it appears that most of the impact is driven
by firms operating in the manufacturing (column 2) as well as retail sector (column 3). The
  27
     Moreover, in order to confirm that going from city- to firm-level regressions does not affect the size of
the coefficients, we provide event-study results based on firm-level regressions in Figure 4.24 of the online
appendix, consistent with city-level estimates. Coefficients are somewhat smaller (+.15 versus +.25) but
qualitatively similar.

other sectors show much smaller and insignificant effect (column 4). The remaining columns
suggest that the effect is stronger for firms belonging to the bottom half of the distribution
of size and productivity (as measured by value-added per worker). This could potentially
reflect the fact that large and productive firms had already invested in their own IT internal
capabilities and are less reliant on the state of local infrastructure. Another possibility is
that these firms had already formed a network of foreign suppliers and were less reliant on
broadband to overcome informational frictions impeding their matching with foreign suppli-
ers. Note that, because larger and more productive firms tend to be more import-intensive
(Bas and Strauss-Kahn, 2014, document this using French data), the documented pattern of
heterogeneity implies that the ascent of broadband has contributed to allow smaller and less
productive firms to import more and thus lower the correlation between size and productivity
and imports intensity.

Heterogeneity based on goods and trading partners. It is highly plausible that the
reduction in the fixed cost of importing new products reflects lower informational frictions.
We try to test this assertion by assessing whether the marginal effect of broadband coverage
is stronger depending on the characteristics of the sourcing country as well as the good being
sourced which are proxy for high initial return to reduction in informational frictions.

The impact of accessing broadband internet from the home country (France) on the amount
of information gathered on a specific sourcing country is likely to be higher for sourcing
country with high broadband coverage. Therefore, to the extent that the broadband-induced
reduction in informational frictions between locations is higher when both locations are well
covered by broadband, one would expect that the effect of broadband coverage on imports

                                                                 275


is stronger for goods sourced from high coverage countries. This is what we find when
comparing column (2) versus column (3) of Table 4.4.

Rauch (1999) and subsequent work (e.g. Nunn, 2007) argues that informational frictions are
more important in determining the matching international buyers and sellers and shaping
trade flows for differentiated products than for products traded on organized exchanges.
Therefore to the extent that broadband internet stimulates imports through the alleviation
of informational frictions, one would expect its marginal effect on average to be higher for
differentiated than for homogeneous products. As reported in column (4) and (5) of Table
4.4, we find results broadly in line with this prediction.

       Notes : This table presents results of a panel of firm-level regression where the explanatory variable of interest Broadband
        Internet access is the continuous measure of broadband access in city i and year t defined as a time-weighted percentage
        of area covered in city i as defined in equation (4.1). Sample: Firms included in the sample are single-city firms with at
        least one positive trade flow (import) before Broadband Internet access. Robust standard errors clustered at the province

        the World Development Indicators database. A country is defined as high coverage if it has a coverage above the median as
        of 1999. The definition of differentiated goods is obtained from the classification proposed by Rauch (1999). * p < 0.1, **

Overall, while inferring mechanism from observational data is necessarily delicate, we view
the firm-level evidence gathered in this section as strongly consistent with and broadly sup-
portive of the notion that BBI boosted imports through reduction in informational frictions.


6.3.       Impact on firm performance and import-intensity
Import-intensity. We have seen that broadband internet increased the overall value of
imports. In this section, we assess whether it led to an increase in import-intensity which
normalize the value of imports by some measure of the size of economic activity undertaken
by firms located in a given city.

We use two measures which leads to broadly similar results. The first variable measure
imports over sales while the second measures what we call the “foreign share” which is the
ratio of import to overall inputs. Results are displayed respectively in panel (a) and (b) of

Firm performance 1: Value-added, sales and productivity. While trade is an im-
portant outcome in its own right, it is also interesting to see whether the increased imports
of firms is associated with an expansion of overall activity as captured in their sales or
value-added. The results, displayed in Figure 4.12, show increases by 5% in sales and 6% in
value-added.

Beyond the scale of economic activity, access to a broader range of inputs have been docu-
mented to increase productivity (Amiti and Konings, 2007; Topalova and Khandelwal, 2011).
As most of the evidence focuses on the manufacturing sector (e.g. Halpern et al., 2015; Blaum
et al., 2018) we split the analysis of productivity (value added per worker here) between the
manufacturing and the non-manufacturing sectors.

where ICjt is the value of overall intermediate consumption as reported in the balance sheet data and Mjt
is the value of imports as reported in the customs data for firm j at time t. We assess the robustness of
our results when excluding capital goods from the customs data in order to make the measurement from
the two data sources more comparable. Indeed, measuring capital goods in the balance sheet is delicate
because they are likely to be accounted for as investment rather than as intermediate consumption and there
is no distinction between domestic and foreign goods in the data at hand. Excluding capital goods allows
us to make sure that the imports as documented in the customs contain goods comparable to intermediate
consumption as documented in the accounting data. Results excluding the capital goods are broadly similar
with a point estimate of +0.147. See Figure 4.23 in the appendix.

Results in Figure 4.13 shows a positive effect of broadband expansion on the productivity
of the manufacturing sector, but essentially no impact outside of the manufacturing sector
where value-added and employment grew in the same proportions. The positive impact on
firms’ scale with no effect on the apparent productivity of labor in the non-manufacturing
sector is consistent with previous work for the UK provided by DeStefano et al. (2018) who
find a positive average treatment effect of ICT instrumented by local broadband availability
on firm’s revenue and employment but not on different measures of productivity.29
  29
       They do not show long run effect on productivity by sector however.

Firm performance 2: Exports. While our paper deliberately focuses on imports as it
matters most directly for consumer welfare and is an understudided outcome relatively to
exports, there are reasons to believe that exports might also react positively to the improve-
ment of information infrastructure following broadband expansion. This is broadly what we
find although results are less precise than in the case of imports.

Panel (a) of Figure 4.14 shows that export grew faster post broadband expansion, with a
coefficient of about +0.20 after five years. In the light of the positive impact we obtained
on overall value-added and sales, the fact that exports increases could be a mere reflection
of overall gains in productivity with no specific effect on exports through reduction in trade
frictions.

To investigate whether there is a specific impact on exports, that is a reduction in the cost
of exports above and beyond unit cost reduction, we investigate the effect on the export over
sales ratio. The results are displayed in panel (b) and point to a positive effect although this
coefficient. Quantitatively, the coefficient is very similar to the one regarding the import-
over-sales ratio for d = 5 (0.125 versus 0.15).

We see however that the coefficient is not very precisely estimated and is significant at the 5%
level for d = 5 only. We notice moreover some differential pre-trends suggesting that a causal
interpretation of the coefficients might be more difficult than in the case of importing which
shows a clear break of trend around the expansion year (see Figure 4.3 and 4.11 above).

This could be lower precision of our estimates could reflect a higher degree of heterogeneity
among exporters than importers in their reaction to the broadband expansion or that in
our particular setting, the information frictions alleviated by the particular technology we
consider are more relevant for importers than exporters. This is consistent with the fact
highlighted in survey data from the early 2000s that firms use internet mostly to buy rather
than to sell and that this is particularly true for small and medium enterprises (OECD,
2004).30 In view of the more mixed results we obtain for exports, our modelling exercise in
the next section will ignore the export channel in its basic version but will allow for it as an
extension.

7.            Conceptual framework for quantification
In this section, we set-up a simple but general model of firm-level imports in order to assess
the welfare implications of our findings. We aim in particular to quantify the overall impact
of broadband internet on consumer prices and the contribution of import channel, i.e., the
increase in consumer surplus that can be attributed to how broadband increases import
penetration.

The full derivations of the model are contained in the online appendix (section B). Here, we
present the building blocks of the models, alongside the main formulas and intuitions allowing
us to relate our empirical estimates to changes in consumer welfare. We also discuss the key
assumptions of the model and how relaxing them would change the interpretation of our
results.


7.1.          Baseline model
Production side. The first building block relates to the production side. Firms combine
labor and intermediate inputs using a constant return to scale Cobb-Douglas production
function—with a labor share denoted as γ. Intermediate inputs are themselves a CES aggre-
gate of domestic and foreign inputs—with an elasticity of substitution denoted as ε. Firms
are heterogeneous in terms of TFP as well as in the intensity of domestic inputs use. Firms
choose their bundle of inputs and their optimal sourcing strategy—i.e. the set of product-
country combinations they source from—in order to minimize their unit cost of production.

                                                                                              280


In this environment, we allow broadband expansion to affect firms along several margins.
Broadband can directly affect TFP, reduce the effective price of labor through skill-biased
technical change (SBTC as documented in Akerman et al. (2015)) and lower the price of
imports. The model remains agnostic regarding which type of trade costs (variable, fixed per
destination or product, search friction etc.) is affected by the broadband internet expansion
shock.

Under this set of assumptions, we can express the total change in unit cost induced by
broadband expansion as the sum of the import channel and a residual term that includes
all the other channels. Denoting ui (0) and ui (1) the unit cost for firms in city i without and
with access to broadband internet respectively, we write:

          E[ln(ui (1)) − ln(ui (0))] = Import channel + Other channels (∆ in TFP)           (4.5)

Moreover, we can express the import channel—i.e. the unit cost effect of BI through changes
in the import environment—solely as a function of (i ) the effect of BI on the foreign share of
inputs and (ii ) the parameters of the production function (γ and ε). Indeed, the combination
of cost minimization and price-taking behavior implies that the share of inputs sourced
abroad is a sufficient statistic for the effect of trade in inputs on unit costs. Accordingly, the
impact of broadband internet on the foreign share—whose estimates are presented in Figure
4.11—is a sufficient statistic for the part of the effect of broadband internet on the unit
cost that is channeled through changes in importing behavior. The formula for the import
channel can be expressed as:
                                                                             
                              ui (1)                          1−γ      1 − sfi (1)
  Import Price Channel ≡ E ln                               =     E ln                ,     (4.6)
                              ui (0)       TFP fixed          ε−1      1 − sfi (0)

where sfi stands for city i firms’ share of foreign inputs. Equation (4.6) states that the
broadband-induced decline in unit cost through changes in the import environment is directly
related to the decrease in the domestic share (i.e. 1 − sfi ) with a coefficient depending on
parameters of the production function. A given change in the domestic share will translate
in larger variation in the unit cost for lower values of both the labor share γ and the elasticity
of substitution between foreign and domestic inputs ε. At this point, it is worth emphasizing
that the translation of BBI-induced changes in domestic changes into unit cost of production
does not require any assumption regarding the market conduct of firms or the demand system
for the final good.

Demand-side, type of competition and the firm location problem. To translate
the decline of unit costs into consumer welfare we need to specify consumer preferences as
well as how firms compete. We consider the case where a representative consumer has CES
preferences over the varieties produced by each firm—with elasticity of substitution σ > 1.
We further assume that firms operate under monopolistic competition.

The French economy is made up of a large set of cities which differ in terms of their lo-
cal productivity and cost of importing. Trade costs between those cities are null. Firms’
productivity depends on an idiosyncratic component which varies at the city × firm level
and is distributed Fréchet—with shape parameter θ > σ − 1. Firms accordingly pick the
profit-maximizing location among French cities.

Monopolistic competition and CES preferences combined with constant return to scale en-
sures the full pass-through of variations in unit costs into prices. Under the additional
assumption that the impact of broadband on the foreign share of inputs is homogeneous
across firms, the model predicts that the percentage decline in the consumer price index is
identical to the unit cost decline experienced by each firm (see equation 4.18 in the appendix).

This set of assumptions further allow us to back-out the overall impact of broadband on
unit cost—i.e. the impact inclusive of all the channels including the import channel—from
the effect of broadband on city-level sales, i.e. sales realized by firms located in a given city
(independently of where the customers are located in France), whose estimates are presented
in Figure 4.12, panel (b). More precisely, we can express the overall effect as:
                                                                 
                                             ui (1)       1     xi (1)
                  Total Price Channel ≡ E ln           = − E ln                                            (4.7)
                                             ui (0)       θ     xi (0)

where xi (0) and xi (1) denote city i firms’ sales without and with access to broadband tech-
nology respectively. The average effect of broadband on the local unit cost of production
can be backed-out from the local average effect on sales, given an assumed value for θ—
the Fréchet shape parameter that is inversely related to the variance of the idiosyncratic
productivity component.31
  31
     Intuitively, when θ is small, the variance of the idiosyncratic component is large, so that a local increase
in the non-random part of productivity will not attract many firms. Inversely, when θ is large, firms are
almost indifferent across cities so that small changes in local productivity will generate large-scale relocation
of firms, and also boost sales by local firms. It might appear surprising that the elasticity of sales x to unit
cost u at the city-level does not depend on the elasticity of substitution σ but only on θ. This is however
a standard feature of models featuring discrete and continuous choices. In models following (Hanemann,
1984), the value function derived from the continuous choice problem (here the expected profit given a
specific location) depends on an idiosyncratic term which then drives the discrete choice (here location
choice). With Fréchet or Gumbel-distributed heterogeneity, the parameter driving directly the continuous
choice (σ) cancels out—see equation 4.14 in the appendix.

                                                                 sf (0)

of three parameters of the model (θ, ε, γ) to quantify the change in consumer prices allowed
for by broadband expansion.32

Our estimates for the total impact of broadband on consumer prices and the import channel
write as follows:

                                 1 bsales 1 − γ bsf
                            −      β     =      β × m + residual effect.                                  (4.8)

                                  total           import


Given the calibrated values and our event-study point estimates we obtain:

         Total Price Channel = −1.85%, and Import Price Channel = −0.75%.

Given our calibration, we find that the import channel led to 0.75% increase in consumer
welfare through its effect on the price index. As a point of comparison, Berlingieri et al.
(2018) estimate in a recent paper that trade agreements implemented by the EU led to an
overall decline of 0.24% in the consumer price index over a 20 year period (1993-2013).33
Therefore, while the import channel of broadband internet access might at first seem mod-
erate, it is large compared to other policy experiments and accounts for about 40% of the
consumer gains from broadband internet.34
  32
       Value for the parameters θ, σ and ε are taken from the literature. Parameter θ is obtained from the
most comparable estimate of Fajgelbaum et al. (2019), which also model it as a firm-location productivity
dispersion parameter. For the value of ε, we rely on Blaum et al. (2018)—whose estimation is also carried out
on French data for a comparable period (2000-2006). Our preferred estimate of σ is the one using firm-level
intensive margin trade elasticity by Berthou and Fontagné (2016). The parameter 1 − γ (intermediate good
elasticity of output) is backed-out from the average ratio of intermediate spending over sales after correcting
for mark-up. A full summary of the sources is provided in Table 4.7 of the appendix.
    33
       Note that we use consumer price and consumer welfare interchangeably here. This is an approximation
as some of the fixed costs firms need to spend to engage in importing might reduce firm profits. If consumers
own the firms, their welfare will be negatively affected as their nominal income from firm ownership will
decrease. Therefore reduction in consumer price will be an upper bound for gain in consumer welfare. We
consider however this effect to be likely negligible. The model presented here is partial equilibrium in the
sense that we ignore the link between firm profits and consumer income. Moreover, we take the price of
domestic intermediates as fixed and we do not impose a balanced trade condition. We show in Online
appendix E.1 that allowing the price of intermediates to be endogenous does not subtantially impact the
welfare analysis.
    34
       When ignoring capital goods, the import channel is somewhat lower with an effect of -0.61% on the
price level, i.e. around 30% of the total effect. This lower effect reflects both a slightly lower estimate for
βb5sf (0.148 instead of 0.158) and a lower m (0.101 instead of 0.13). More details regarding the calibration are
provided in appendix Section B.5 and in particular Table 4.7.

7.2.    Extension: exports and labor market clearing wage
Discussion of main assumptions. The quantification described so far is in partial equi-
librium in that it takes wages as exogenous and consider that the broadband shock is too
small to change their equilibrium value. We further ignored the impact of broadband on
exports. The two are linked: export performance can matter for workers’ welfare to the
extent that its raises wages. Accordingly, here we jointly relax two assumptions:35 firms are
now allowed to export more in response to broadband and wages adjust at the national level
in order for the overall labor market to clear.

The export wage channel. Allowing for endogenous wages and exports results in a new
channel of influence of broadband on welfare. We call this impact the export wage channel.
This channel will not leave the channels we saw in the previous subsection unaffected. In
particular, it will change the effect of broadband on consumer prices to the extent that
aggregate wage increases are passed-through into prices.

In section B.6 of the online appendix, we introduce exports in a very simple way: firms
choosing to locate in city i export to foreign market k and face an iceberg cost τik . Broadband
reduces τik and consequently increases the local market potential (i.e. the demand to be
expected when locating in i). Labor is perfectly mobile across cities and cities are small
relative to the overall economy so that the local impact of broadband has no direct impact
on local wages. However, a full nation-wide broadband expansion raises the demand for
labor and therefore pushes the market-clearing wage up. The nationwide labor market
clearing condition gives rise to a wage equation, in which wages are affected by two terms:
(i ) positively by market potential (itself increased through broadband-induced reduction in
τik ), and (ii ) negatively by non-wage determinants of the unit cost (which are impacted by
broadband through productivity gains or by the import-channel).36

Note that a maintained assumption is that null trade costs within France. This assumption
allows us to separately identify unit cost reduction and increase in (export) market potential.
We retrieve the former from the increase in domestic sales, i.e. output of a city that is sold to
French consumers. Moreover, we show that we can retrieve the increase in (export) market
potential in city i from the increase in the share of export in total sales. Our event study
provides an estimate for such an effect—see Figure 4.14.

Based on this additional structure, we propose two decomposition of the aggregate welfare
  35
    All details of the model can be found in section B.6 of the appendix.
  36
    See equation 4.42 in the appendix B.6 for a formal breakdown of the wage effect of broadband into these
two components.

price index components. Second, we decompose those gains into import, export and residual
channels.37 Results from this decompostion are reported in Table 4.5.

 Notes: : This table presents the log-change ×100 in nominal wage (column 3), consumer price (column 4) and overall welfare (column 5) induced by
 broadband expansion to all cities simultaneously. Column (6) and (7) display the contribution in percents of broadband through exports and through
 imports. The last column (8) presents the contribution of residual factors (through gains in TFP). Each row corresponds to a different combination of
 values for the key parameters θ and σ. Our baseline in row (1) correspond to θ estimate from Fajgelbaum et al. (2019). The σ estimate comes from
 Berthou and Fontagné (2016). Columns (9) and (10) recall results from the analysis ignoring wage adjustment as presented in Section 7.1. Note that the
 import-channel presented in Column (10) depends indirectly in σ through the calibration of γ (see Table 4.7 for more details on the calibration).




Table 4.5 provides results of our welfare computations for five different combinations of
values assigned to θ and σ, based on estimates from the literature. Columns (3) to (5)
report changes in nominal wage, price index and overall welfare predicted by our model
under those different parameterizations. National expansion of broadband internet results
in a consumer surplus gain between 2 and 4%, with the change in nominal wage contributing
the lion’s share of the overall impact.

The first row constitutes our benchmark case. Our preferred estimate of σ is the one using
firm-level intensive margin trade elasticity by Berthou and Fontagné (2016), while θ is taken
from Fajgelbaum et al. (2019). Welfare gains are slightly above 3% in that case. Varying the
value of σ in the second and third rows shows that welfare gains are positively associated
with the demand elasticity. The fourth row takes Antras et al. (2017) as a base for θ and σ
estimates. This increases substantially welfare gains, which is mostly due to a lower value
of θ. Comparing the fifth row with the first one, we confirm that welfare gains fall with θ
(which measures how homogeneous firm-city productivity is in the model).

It is also possible to compute which share of the welfare gains are directly caused by increased
imports and exports (columns 6 to 8). We see that exports contribute only modestly to the
overall increase in welfare, while the import channel and the residual gains (coming through
TFP increases) are more comparable in magnitude. Columns (9) and (10) provide results for
 37
      The formula for this decomposition can be found in equation (4.49).

the version of the model ignoring wage adjustment as presented in Section 7.1. A first remark
from the variation over rows of the exogenous wage case is that the change in price index
due to broadband is unaffected by the value of σ, (which is consistent with the left-hand-
side of equation 4.8).38 A second remark can be made from a comparison of welfare effects
with and without allowing for broadband to have an effect on exports and nominal wages.
When the model includes endogenous wages and exports, welfare gains from broadband
increase substantially. This is true across all values of parameters proposed in Table 4.5: the
increase in nominal wages largely dominates the lesser gains on the price index brought by
the expansion of broadband internet.


8.        Conclusion
We find broadband expansion to have substantially changed the importing patterns of French
small and medium-sized firms. The affected firms increased their overall imports by around
a quarter. This was driven by a rise in both the number of source countries and the count
of products imported. The rise in imported value exceeded the growth of turnover, resulting
in a large increase in import intensity (the imports over sales ratio goes up by about 15%).

The first implication of our findings relates to the debate regarding trade vs technology as
separate explanations for labor market outcomes. For instance, Autor et al. (2015) argue that
trade shocks had more impact than technological shocks on the decline of US manufacturing
employment over the 2000’s. Our work suggests that it is hard to empirically disentangle
the effects of trade from those of technology: a specific instance of technological change,
namely broadband internet, has contributed to the trade shocks that this literature typically
takes as given. This interaction is quantitatively large, since we estimate that the rise in
import penetration in France over the 1997-2007 period would have been 16% smaller without
broadband internet.

A second implication is that the positive effect of broadband internet on productivity (Ak-
erman et al., 2015; Ciapanna and Colonna, 2019) and welfare could be partly driven by the
rise in the value and the variety of imported inputs. Under our preferred calibration, our
event study estimates suggest that broadband internet resulted in a reduction of 1.7% in
unit costs. The part of those gains that is attributable to enhanced access to foreign inputs
(the import channel) is close to 25% of the total.

Trade and technology affect consumer welfare not only through prices but also through
  38
       The fact that the import channel does depends on σ comes from the fact that in the model 1 − γ =
expenditure on intermediates
            sales         × σ−1
                             σ .

nominal earnings (Borusyak and Jaravel, 2018). It is plausible, that broadband internet
induced labor market effects that were differentiated depending on whether firms engaged
in international sourcing or not (Koren et al., 2019). Estimating the earning impact of fast
internet by skill level and extending the theoretical model to account for richer interactions
between purchase of foreign inputs and the skill-content of labor demand appears like an
interesting avenue for future research.

B.     Conceptual framework for quantification: full deriva-
       tions
In this section, we set up a simple partial equilibrium model of firm-level imports that allows
to quantify the magnitude of the import channel in terms of consumer welfare. We have
empirically estimated the effect of BI on imports and sales. We show below that, in a model
featuring monopolistic competition and a CES demand system (MC-CES henceforth), we
can recover the total effect of broadband on firm-level productivity (defined as the inverse
of its unit-cost) from estimates of its impact on firm-level sales.

However, because broadband internet affects firm-performance through channels other than
trade, it cannot be considered a valid instrument for imports when explaining unit costs.
This is akin to a failure of the exclusion restriction leaving us with an under-identification
problem: even if we know the total effect of BI on imports and productivity, we cannot
isolate the contribution of broadband-induced imports to the overall effect of broadband
internet on firm-level unit cost. To solve this problem, we add further structure on the
production process and import environment, building on Blaum et al. (2018). In this simple
theoretical framework, we show that a firm’s observed domestic share of inputs (i.e. 1 minus
its import share) encapsulates all of the effects of importing activities on its unit cost. Our
main result is an expression for the overall effect of broadband internet on the price index
and the contribution of the import channel as a function of (i) firm-level effects of broadband
internet on sales and the domestic share of inputs and (ii) structural parameters pertaining to
preferences and technology. We use our reduced-form estimates and calibrate the structural
parameters based on existing work and/or aggregate data in order to quantify the effect of
broadband internet on consumer welfare and the contribution of the import-channel.

We model France as a small open economy composed of N cities indexed by i. We assume
that trade costs within France across cities are negligible. In our baseline model, a fixed mass
of firms, normalized to be of measure one, pick cities in order to maximize profits. A firm j’s
productivity depends on local productive amenities i and an idiosyncratic productivity draw.
The labor market is competitive. We assume that local prices and consumption amenities
do not vary across areas. There is a mass of workers of measure L who are perfectly mobile
so that wages are equalized across cities.

This section is structured as follows. In subsection B.1, we present the demand side of the
economy. In subsection B.2, we present the firm’s location choice and its implications for the
distribution of economic activity across cities. In subsection B.3, we detail the production

function and import environment facing firms. We derive a sufficiency result in subsection
B.4, which allows us to infer unit cost reductions due to trade from change in the input share
of foreign goods. In subsection B.5, we show how we can express changes in consumer prices
due to the import-channel as a function of our event-study estimates and present a first set
of welfare implications of broadband on consumer welfare. As will be made clear below,
we derive the implications of broadband for consumer welfare through the price index, (i)
assuming away the impact of broadband on exports and (ii) considering that the price of
the domestic intermediate goods is fixed and exogenous. We relax each of these assumptions
in the last sections. We revisit the impact of broadband on exports and its implications on
consumer welfare through the nominal wage channel in subsection B.6.


B.1.    Demand and market structure
The representative consumer (we do restrict attention to a single country of consumption,
France in this case) has a classical Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES, denoted σ)
utility function over the set Ω of available varieties of a final good:
                                        Z                      σ
                                                              σ−1
                                                  σ−1
                                   U=            cjσ
                                                        dj           ,
                                           j∈Ω


where ci is the quantity consumed of variety i.

Those varieties are produced domestically under monopolistic competition. The CES de-
mand function aggregated at the level of the nation yields sales xi for a variety (also a firm)
j:
                                 xj ≡ cj pj = pj1−σ EP σ−1 ,                              (4.9)

where E and P respectively represent total expenditure and the ideal CES price index in
this economy and pj represents the price of variety j. We consider a case where each firm
will produce only a single variety which implies that Ω is of measure 1.


B.2.    Firm location choice and city-level sales
Combined with monopolistic competition and constant marginal costs, the CES demand
                                         σ
                                            
system implies a fixed markup over cost σ−1   , and therefore the values of sales writes as:

                                        xij = u1−σ
                                               ij  ×S                                   (4.10)

where uij refers to the unit cost of firm / variety j when choosing city i and S ≡ EP σ−1 σ−1
is a market wide demand-shifter. Given our assumption that trade costs within France are
null this aggregate demand term is not i specific.

We assume that the productivity of firm j in city i is equal to a city-level component divided
by an idiosyncratic productivity that is specific to the pair of the firm j when locating in
city i. Formally we have:
                                        uij = ui /bij ,                                 (4.11)

where the city-wide unit cost common to all firms locating in i is denoted ui and bij refers
to the idiosyncratic productivity draw. We assume bij follows a Fréchet Type 2 distribution
with shape parameter θ (Fajgelbaum et al., 2019). Given constant return to scale and the
MC-CES combination, profits are proportional to sales. Denoting πij the profit realized by
firm j in city i, we can write:

Impact of broadband internet on sales and unit cost. Imposing this simple structure,
we aim to infer the effect of broadband internet on the unit cost for a given value of θ. Our
estimate of the effect of BI on total domestic sales d years after broadband internet expansion
is denoted as βbddsales . We will use our estimate of the long-run impact (after 5 years), β5dsales .
Using the sales equation (4.14), and assuming that the elasticity of substitution of the final
good is left unchanged by the arrival of the internet, we can write:

on domestic sales can be attributed to a fall in costs in the city where firm i is located
and produces. Let us denote ψi ≡ ui (1)/ui (0). Assuming, consistently with our empirical
analysis, that all cities experience the same treatment effect, i.e. ψi = ψ, ∀i ∈ Ω, we obtain

B.3.    Production function
We now specify the production function and the import environment, building on Blaum
et al. (2018)’s setup. We assume that the technology we describe below is common to all
firms located in city i. Accordingly we will refer to city and firm interchangeably in this
section, although one must keep in mind that, within each city i, firms are heterogeneous
in terms of their idiosyncratic draw bij . Each firm operates a Cobb-Douglas production
function combining labor and intermediate goods, with the exponent on labor denoted as γ:

                                                   Yi = Ai Lγi Xi1−γ                         (4.20)

where Yi refers to total physical production, Ai is the total factor productivity of the firm,
Li is the effective quantity of labor, and Xi the effective quantity of intermediate inputs.
The parameter γ determine the labor share in total costs.

where Xi,D is the quantity of domestic inputs while Xi,F refers to the quantity of imported
inputs. The parameter ε > 1 determines the elasticity of substitution between foreign and
domestic inputs. The terms αD and αF parameterize the relative quality of domestic versus
foreign inputs. Finally, the foreign input Xi,F itself aggregates imported varieties through a
constant return to scale production function Gi () which can be city-specific:

                                        Xi,F = Gi ({qo Xi,o }o∈Ωi ).                      (4.22)

Foreign inputs Xi,o are indexed according to their country of origin o. The term qo parame-
terizes the relative efficiency of inputs from country o. Ωi refers to the set of countries from
which the firm sources its inputs (its sourcing strategy) and is potentially an endogenous
variable (as in Antras et al., 2017, for instance).


B.4.    Sufficiency result
In that setting, conditioning on the set of sourcing countries Ωi , the unit-cost is given by:
                           (                                                       )

                                                      c∈Ωi


where pF,o is the price of input varieties imported from o. We can define the (ideal) import
price index as the ratio of the spending on imports over the effective quantity of imports as
defined in (4.22):
                                      pi (Ωi ) ≡ Ei,F /Xi,F

where Ei,F denotes expenditure on foreign goods by firm i. Note that we leave, for now, the
function Gi () unspecified. However for most plausible aggregators, pi (Ωi ) will be declining
in the cardinality of Ωi (|Ωi |), meaning that the effective price index of imports will decrease
in the number of sourcing countries. In the presence of fixed costs of importing that are
paid per destination, there is a trade-off between higher payment towards origin-specific
fixed costs of importing and the resulting reduction in the price index of imported goods
which ultimately translates into lower overall unit cost. This can occur in Armington-type
models where inputs are differentiated by country of origin, thus creating a love-for-variety
effect (Halpern et al., 2015; Sandoz, 2017) or in models where expanding the set of sourcing

Given the price index of imports pi (Ωi ), and the CES aggregation of foreign and domestic
inputs, we can express the price index of all intermediates as:

Note that we assume that trade cost within France are null. This implies that pXD , the
price of the domestic intermediate goods is constant across locations and does not depend
on whether a city has broadband or not. Given the Cobb-Douglas assumption at the upper
level, it is straightforward to express unit cost as:

where sdi ≡ pXD XD,i /(XF,i p(Ωi )+pXD XD,i ) is the fraction of firm spending on intermediates

inputs by isolating Qi (Ωi ) in (4.25), then substituted into (4.24):

where Ãi = Ai (αD ) ε−1 (1 − γ)1−γ γ γ . Equation (4.26) is essentially a sufficiency result, as
first demonstrated by Blaum et al. (2018) (see their equation 6), stating that conditional on
its domestic expenditure share (i.e. 1 minus the importing share), the rest of the import
environment (including the global sourcing strategy Ωi , prices poi or the technology through
which foreign goods are agregated Gi ()) does not affect the firm’s unit cost. The domestic
expenditure share conveys all the information from the inputs importing activity that is
relevant for the unit cost.40 Note that this sufficient statistic result does not depend on a
specific market structure assumption regarding the final good. Opting for CES preferences
with monopolistic competition as we do here is useful to obtain the one-to-one mapping from
changes in unit cost to changes in consumer prices shown in section B.1.
  40
     We present the sufficiency result in a very simplified import environment (Armington model with a
continuum of homogeneous countries with homogeneous variables and fixed costs for importing) that allows
for a simple closed-form solution in the Online Appendix B.

B.5.     Broadband expansion and the sufficiency result
On top of the increased imports and other trade-related impacts, the expansion of broadband
internet is likely to affect unit costs ui through additional channels. It could for instance
affect Ai directly.

Using equation (4.26) and maintaining the notation (0) and (1) for the potential outcomes
taken without and with BI respectively, we obtain:

                                                        ui (1)                      0.05

To locate this estimate in the literature, we note that the figure of -1.85% is about half
the productivity effect estimated by Akerman et al. (2015) in Norway. They found that a
10% increase in broadband availability is associated with a 0.4% increase in productivity
  41
      Note that we take γ here to be a policy invariant parameter. This assumption appears at odds with
the empirical findings of Fort (2017) who shows that ICT adoption in the US increases the probability
of both domestic and foreign sourcing by firms. Her results would suggest a positive effect of broadband
expansion on 1 − γ. However, in our application, we do not find any effect of broadband internet on the
empirical counterpart of 1 − γ. The point estimate after 5 periods is −0.004 with 95% confidence interval:
(0.0036, −0.0116). Results are displayed Figure 4.22 of the online appendix. It seems therefore warranted to
model γ as a fixed ( i.e. treatment invariant) parameter.
   42
      This value corresponds to the mean price elasticity of sales in gravity equations (estimated with country
fixed-effects) reported in the meta-analysis by Head and Mayer (2014) based on 32 papers and 744 estimates.

(as measured by overall production holding inputs constant), suggesting a 4% increase when
broadband availability goes from 0 to 100%.

The impact of BI access that goes through the import channel (via an increased access to
foreign intermediates), can be expressed as:
                                                                               
                                         1−γ                          sdi (1)           1−γ
                  Import Price Channel =     ln                                     =       × β5sf × m,          (4.29)

where β5sf refers to the 5-year horizon effect of BI on the log of the foreign share sf ≡ 1 − sd,
and m = sf /sd.43

For the value of ε, we rely on Blaum et al. (2018)—whose estimation is also carried out
on French data for a comparable period (2000-2006). For the overall economy we retain
                                                on intermediates
ε = 2.3. The model implies: 1 − γ = expenditure sales            × σ−1
                                                                    σ

of the ratio of spending on intermediates over sales and σ = 3.5 yields 1 − γ = 0.47. As a
consequence, the import channel of the effect of BI writes as:

                                                      1−γ
                    Import Price Channel =                 × (−m × β5sf )

                                                    = −0.75% including capital goods
                                                    = −0.58% excluding capital goods.


Berlingieri et al. (2018) estimate in a recent paper that trade agreements implemented by
the EU led to an overall decline of 0.24% in the consumer price index over a 20 year period
(1993-2013). Therefore, while the import channel of broadband internet access might at first
seem moderate, it is large compared to other policy experiments and accounts for about 33%
of the consumer gains from broadband internet.


B.6.      Extension: Exports and endogenous wage
Until this point, we have assumed that firms only sell on the domestic market. We have also
assumed that broadband expansion, even when applied to the entire economy, is too small
to have a direct impact on wages.

In this subsection, we relax those assumptions by introducing exports in our model. Our
extension to allow for exports has no impact on the welfare effects that go through the price

    Two points are worth noting: (1) the market potential related to foreign sales is city specific because we
allow trade costs to be specific between each city i and destination k, (2) the domestic market potential is
stable constant across cities. We make the assumption that the domestic market is fully integrated and trade
costs across cities within France are null and therefore will not be affected by the introduction of broadband.

           Notes: This table presents the parameters and reduced-form effects used to perform the welfare computation. The sample statistics
           used are computed for year 1999 (i.e. prior to any widespread broadband expansion).

Table 4.8 provides results of our welfare computation for five different combinations of the
two key elasticities obtained from the literature (θ and σ, reported in the first two columns).
Columns (3) to (5) report changes in nominal wage, price index and overall welfare predicted
by our model under those different parameterizations. National expansion of broadband
internet results in a consumer surplus gain between 2 and 4.4%, with the change in nominal
wage contributing the lion’s share of the overall impact.

The first row constitutes our benchmark case. Parameter θ is obtained from the most
comparable estimate of Fajgelbaum et al. (2019), which also model it as a firm-location
productivity dispersion parameter. Our preferred estimate of σ is the one using firm-level
intensive margin trade elasticity by Berthou and Fontagné (2016). Welfare gains are slightly

above 3% in that case. Varying the value of σ in the second and third rows shows that
welfare gains are positively associated with the demand elasticity. The fourth row takes
Antras et al. (2017) as a base for θ and σ estimates. This increases substantially welfare
gains, which is mostly due to a lower value of θ. Comparing the fifth row with the first
one, we confirm that welfare gains fall with θ (which measures how homogeneous firm-city
productivity is in the model).

     welfare (column 5) induced by broadband expansion to all cities simultaneously. Column (6) and (7) display the
     contribution in percents of broadband through exports and through imports. The last column (9) presents the
     contribution of residual factors (through gains in TFP). Each row corresponds to a different combination of values
     for the key parameters θ and σ. Our baseline in row (1) correspond to θ estimate from Fajgelbaum et al. (2019).
     The σ estimate comes from Berthou and Fontagné (2016). Note that γ varies with values of σ due to the calibration
     procedure (see Table 4.7 for details).

Coming back to results in Table 4.8, we see that exports contribute only modestly to the
overall increase in welfare, while the import channel and the residual gains (coming for
instance through TFP increases) are more comparable in magnitude.

C.1.     Description of the datasets
Here we present in some more details the datatsets used in the analysis:

   1. DADS: employment at the establishment level: The annual social data decla-
      ration (DADS) files contain information on each salaried contract for all firms of the
      competitive sector. Crucially, the place of work is documented at the city level. We
      use a version of this dataset that is aggregated at the establishment-level and allows
      us to locate firms and choose single-city firms. The firm identifier is identical to the
      one present in the customs and balance sheet data thus allowing us to localize the
      importing and economic performance of firms in a given city.
   2. Customs data: This file is produced by the customs office, and compiles the imported
      and exported values and quantities for each firm-destination-eight-digit product cate-
      gory combination. This file covers only trade in goods and therefore covers primarily
      manufacturing firms but also include retail and wholesale sectors as well as the service
      sector more generally. The data is subject to some declaration thresholds which varies
      depending on whether the trade is extra or within EU. For imports from outside the
      EU, reporting is required from each firm and flow if the imported value exceeds 1,000
      Euros (this threshold was lifted in 2010 but does not vary over the sample period). For
      imports within the EU, there exists several threshold regarding import flows. Import
      flows have to be reported as long as the firm’s annual trade value exceeds 100,000
      Euros. There are only minor variation in the declaration thresholds of over the periods
      (see row 3 for imports of Table 2 in ?).48
   3. BRN: Income and balance sheet: This file is produced by the French statistical
      institute (INSEE) on the basis of corporate income tax returns for firms with revenue
      above than 763 K euros. This dataset has been widely used in the trade literature (see
      e.g. Mayer et al., 2014). This information at the firm-level is taken from the official
      form is CERFA 2050-9 which is the French equivalent to the IRS Form 1120 (Corporate
      Income Tax Return).
   4. Local exchange gepographical coverage data: INSEE and the regulatory agency
      (ARCEP) produced a file approximating the geographical coverage of each LE in terms
  48
     The most significant shift is an increase in the threshold in 2001 (from 40k to 100k euros). If anything,
this change should play against us finding an effect.

   site documenting the current and past quality of internet connection at the local level.
   It contains the exact date for each LE of the update to DSL technology. We were able
   to check with economists at Orange that our dates matched exactly their data for the
   year within the sample (1999-2007).

C.2.   List of variables
  1. Value of import: This variable is constructed from the custom file matched with
     the establishment-level employment data. It is equal to the sum of the values of the
     imported goods over a given year for all firms located in a given city.
  2. Number of flows: This variable is constructed from the custom file matched with
     the establishment-level employment data. It is defined as sum of the number of im-
     porting flows good over a given year for all firms located in a given city. An importing
     flow is defined as the finest level of observation available in the customs data which
     corresponds to a unique firm × product (HS-6) × sourcing country combination.
  3. Average value per flow: This variable is defined as: Average value per flow =
      Value of import
     Number of flows
                      .
  4. Density: This variable is defined as: Density = Population      census 1999
                                                                City Area
                                                                                 . The population
     variable is taken from the 1999 Census, the last exhaustive census available in France,
     which also matches the year of the very beginning of the broadband expansion.
  5. Number of fiscal households and average fiscal income: source Fichier de
     l’impôt sur le revenu des communes (IRCOM)
  6. Employment shares: Number of employees per sector, aggregated from DADS es-
     tablishment data. The sectors are defined based on a coarsened version of the 2-digit
     NAF rev. 2003. The sectors are defined as follows: primary sector (2-digit NAF codes:
     1 to 14), manufacturing (2-digit NAF codes: 15 to 39), utilities (40 and 41), construc-
     tion (45), auto repair (50), retail (51 and 52), hotel (55), transport (60 to 63), finance
     (65 to 71, also includes real estate and rentals) business services (72 to 74), personal
     services (80 to 97). Overwhelmingly public sectors are excluded (2-digit NAF: 64 and
     75).
  7. Sales: Sales are documented in the BRN files at the firm-level. This is not inclusive
     of VAT.
  8. Value added: Value-added is documented in the BRN at the firm-level. It is inclusive
     of taxes on production that are deductible with respect to the corporate income tax.

Sensitivity with respect to binning pre-treatment periods

This appendix presents results based on the following specification:


                                    d1
  Yit = βd0 × 1{t − t0i ≤ −4} +              βd × 1{d + t0i = t} + x0it δ + αi + ψd(i),t + εit (4.50)

                                   d6=−1



t0i refers to the city-specific arrival year of broadband internet. Periods relative to broadband
expansion are index by d. In this specification, the coefficients for d ≤ d0 are constrained to
be equal (they are binned together in the terminology of Schmidheiny and Siegloch (2019)).
More specifically, we consider observations with d ∈ {−6, 5} and we set d0 = 4.

Notes: This figure plots estimates for specification in equation (4.2—fully dynamic) and (4.3—semi dynamic). The number
of flows (left panel) is defined as the number of the sum of all firm-origin-product combination for a given city in a given year.
The average value of per flow (right panel) is defined as the overall value of imports by firms located in a given city divided by
the number of flows as defined above. The baseline specification includes 1999 population density at the city level interacted
with quadratic and linear trends. 95 % confidence interval are presented. Standard errors clustered at the département level.
The sample include all cities with a positive trade flow (import).

Endogenous domestic intermediate. Our quantification takes the price of domestic
intermediate inputs has fixed. In order to aggregate the effect of changes in the import
environment onto the overall price level in a general equilibrium setting, we need to specify
how the intermediate goods sector operates. A natural way to do this is to postulate a
roundabout production whereby firms use a domestic input that is produced using the output
of all other firms in the economy (Caliendo and Parro, 2015, is a recent example using this
technology). In this one-sector model this implies that P = pXD . Accordingly, substituting

Therefore the aggregate effect is now equal to 1/γ times the micro effect, but this does not
affect the relative important of the import-channel. With γ = 0.53 for instance, we have a
total effect of 3.5% and an import channel of 1.41%.


E.2.    Conceptual framework: a simple example
In firm-level importing models, the choice of the optimal set of sourcing problem is complex
as, unlike for exporting problems, the choice of individual sourcing countries are interde-
pendent as they interact through the cost function (Antras et al., 2017). The approach
developed in Section B, inspired by Blaum et al. (2018), allows us to quantify the consumer
welfare effect of broadband internet in a firm-level importing model without having to fully
characterize the importing environment and solve for the optimal sourcing strategy.

In this appendix section, we illustrate the sufficiency result presented in B.3, within a very
simple but fully specified model. When not otherwise specified, the notation follows that of
Section B.

Production function follows a Cobb-Douglas:

                                       Y = A × Lγ X 1−γ


The cost minimization program writes as:

We can also express unit cost u as a function of s1 using its relationship with the price index

In that setting the sufficiency result states that any effect of a variation in f, r on the unit
cost u is operating through s1 . Therefore, the effect of broadband internet on the unit cost

Conclusion

This dissertation is a collection of four chapters that study frictional credit and goods mar-
kets.

In chapter 1, I develop a new theory of firm-bank matching subject to search frictions. I
provide a causal evidence of such frictions affect firm-bank matching and the allocation
of bank credit, using the staggered roll-out of broadband internet in France as a shock
on transaction and search costs. I show that this technology-induced reduction in search
frictions triggers an increase by 6% of the share of credit exchanged between interconnected
cities. This positive effect varies with the initial level of search frictions: it is higher when
two very distant cities are connected. On the contrary, the effect the effect is almost null
when two neighboring cities, already economically very closely tied, are interconnected by
internet. Leveraging bank branch-level data, I document that Broadband Internet diffusion
allows banks to match with new firms located remotely. Connected banks increase their
share of credit lent to firms located outside their city by 10%, and their share of remote
clients by almost 12%. As a result, the average distance between a bank and its customers
increases by 10% in the medium run after broadband internet access. Finally, I plug these
estimates into the equation linking search frictions to loan prices. Interpreted within my
model, the reduced-form estimates imply that the reduction in search frictions due to the
large diffusion of Broadband Internet lowered the cost of debt for small businesses by 4.9%
on average. Overall, this chapter highlight the role of transactions and search cost in shaping
firm’s access to credit. Credit markets with high search frictions make financing by bank
credit both difficult, time-consuming and onerous, especially for small businesses. This
conclusion calls for a variety of economic policies aiming at to make the process of searching
and applying for credit more fluid, efficient and less burdensome, in particular in a period of
pandemic marked by the disappearance of face-to-face interactions and the consequent surge
of digitalization.

Chapter 2 studies another aspect of frictions affecting the credit markets and hindering the

ability of firms to raise external finance. We indeed provide evidence that a large share of
local bank branches in France are specialized in lending to some industries. We also show
that this local bank specialization matters for SMEs’ access to credit: a small firm enjoys
on average a better access to bank credit when the local branch of its relationship bank
has gained a better knowledge of the industry to which the firm belongs. Using a very rich
dataset on bank branch closures over 2010-2017, we find that closures on average entail a
substantial and persistent loss in credit supplied for the local customers which are transferred
to another branch. Importantly however, firms which, as a consequence, lose access to loan
officers specialized in their industry are more badly hit than others. This effect is not wiped
out when considering confounding factors such as the increased distance or the decreased
local bank competition that may be associated with the transfer.Our findings have possibly
important policy implications. First, competition regulators overseeing cuts in bank branch
networks following bank mergers should be aware that local bank specialization exists and
matters for credit supply to SMEs. Concerns may arise if simple competition rules, such
as the obligation to close one of two branches in a given area, are implemented bluntly.
Second, supervisors and bank managers should be aware that closing specialized branches
may have differentiated effects on small borrowers, depending on their industry. Many issues
remain however open, and left for further research. A first, looming question is of course
to understand how and why local bank branches become specialized in funding one specific
industry (more than other neighbor branches do). A possible cause of specialization may
be diffusion effects within networks of customers (e.g., buyers and suppliers, or members
of local professional clubs): in other words, the lending pattern of a branch is likely to be
history-dependent. An idiosyncratic role of some loan officers, who e.g. join a branch with
a better experience in dealing with a certain type of firms, also comes to mind. In this
case, the pending issue for bank managers is to ensure that such human capital is not lost
whenever the branch closes.

In chapter 3, we study credit markets (and how frictions shape the aggregate fluctuations of
credit) from a macroeconomic standpoint. Our analysis highlights the role and importance of
the extensive margin in aggregate credit fluctuations. The methodology we develop for rela-
tionship flows extends that of labor research to account for the specificities of credit markets
and is applicable to the study of other frictional markets and countries with available credit
register data. We view our empirical approach and dataset as a novel laboratory and as a
first step toward uncovering more properties of credit relationships and their aggregate impli-
cations. While we focus mostly on establishing stylized facts and identifying the distinctive
features of extensive/intensive margins, we believe that fleshing out the potential economic
mechanisms behind these dynamics can provide additional connections to the macro-finance

literature, and in particular the role played by collateral and bank balance-sheet channels.
More broadly, given the key role played by the extensive margin of credit along the business
cycle frequency and in the long run, this analysis raises the issue of whether banking models
abstracting from such a quantitatively important dimension provide a reasonable bench-
mark for the study of aggregate credit fluctuations. Thus, building models that account
for both margins is, in our opinion, critical when thinking about bank credit. We leave the
implications of these arguments for future research.

Finally, chapter 4 studies how a technological shock may affect international goods mar-
kets by reducing information frictions. We find broadband expansion to have substantially
changed the importing patterns of French small and medium-sized firms. The affected firms
increased their overall imports by around a quarter. This was driven by a rise in both the
number of source countries and the count of products imported. The rise in imported value
exceeded the growth of turnover, resulting in a large increase in import intensity (the imports
over sales ratio goes up by about 15%). The first implication of our findings relates to the
debate regarding trade vs technology as separate explanations for labor market outcomes.
The literature argue that trade shocks had more impact than technological shocks on the
decline of US manufacturing employment over the 2000’s. Our work suggests that it is hard
to empirically disentangle the effects of trade from those of technology: a specific instance
of technological change, namely broadband internet, has contributed to the trade shocks
that this literature typically takes as given. This interaction is quantitatively large, since we
estimate that the rise in import penetration in France over the 1997-2007 period would have
been 16% smaller without broadband internet.

        “One should hardly have to tell academicians that information is a valuable

                                    – George J. Stigler, The Economics of Information


        e lauréat du Prix Nobel 1982, George J. Stigler, remarquait dans un article fondateur

L        intitulé The Economics of Information (Stigler, 1961) l’absence criante de concept
         d’information dans la littérature économique. Ce constat est aujourd’hui obsolète:
en soixante ans, la notion d’information a pénétré de nombreux champs de la recherche
économique. Nous savons désormais que l’information est imparfaite, qu’il est parfois couteux
d’en acquérir et qu’il existe d’importantes asymétries d’information. Les quatre chapitres
de cette thèse sont une tentative d’étendre le champs nos connaissances sur les effets de
l’information imparfaite dans les marchés du crédit et des biens, en s’appuyant sur des
données micro-économiques. Dans cette introduction, je présente d’abord le contexte de
chaque chapitre séparément. Une description détaillée des chapitres est ensuite fournie.

Un des premiers courants de la littérature économique étudiant l’idée d’information s’est
concentré sur l’acquisition d’information en développant des modèles de search dans lesquels
il est coûteux pour les individus d’acquérir une information privée (McCall, 1970; Diamond,
1971), s’éloignant ainsi des modèles d’équilibre général walrasiens qui reposent sur l’idée d’un
ajustement instantané entre l’offre et la demande. Ce champs de recherche a progressivement
évolué vers les modèles d’appariement et de négociation (matching and bargaining) et de
recherche dirigée (directed search) qui sont aujourd’hui largement utilisés pour étudier le
marché du travail (cf. Rogerson et al., 2005), l’économie monétaire (Kiyotaki and Wright,
1993), l’économie financière (Duffie et al., 2005; Weill, 2007), l’économie urbaine (cf. Zenou,
2009 pour une monographie) ou encore l’analyse du marché matrimonial (Mortensen, 1988;
Shimer and Smith, 2000). Une branche émergente de cette littérature a récemment mis en
évidence l’importance des frictions de recherche dans le commerce (international) des biens
(Rauch, 2001; Chaney, 2014; Allen, 2014; Lenoir et al., 2018), reconnaissant qu’il faut du
temps et des ressources à un exportateur pour se renseigner sur les conditions du marché

et trouver des clients à l’étranger ou, symétriquement, à un importateur pour trouver le
bon fournisseur. En outre, cette littérature a également montré comment la diffusion des
technologies de l’information et de la communication (TIC) peut réduire ces frictions (Jensen,
2007; Aker, 2010; Goyal, 2010; Lendle et al., 2016; Steinwender, 2018; Akerman et al., 2018;
Bhuller et al., 2019). Les chapitres 1 and 4 de cette thèse contribuent directement à cette
branche de la littérature.

Dans le chapitre 1, j’étends l’étude des frictions de recherche aux marchés du crédit. Motivé
par des évidences empiriques que je documente sur les marchés locaux du crédit en France,
je propose une théorie de l’appariement entre entreprises et banques soumis à des frictions
de recherche. Les entreprises amorçent un processus de recherche coûteux pour localiser et
rencontrer le bon partenaire bancaire. Après la rencontre, les agency frictions empêchent
les banques de sélectionner et de suivre les projets de manière optimale. J’estime struc-
turellement mon modèle sur des données françaises en utilisant le déploiement progressif de
l’Internet haut débit (ADSL), de 1997 à 2007, comme un choc qui réduit les frictions de
recherche. Je confirme les prédictions du modèle selon lesquelles l’allocation optimale du
crédit a été modifiée par ce choc. Enfin, le modèle permet de quantifier l’impact de cette
réduction des frictions de recherche – induite par un choc technologique – sur les prix des
prêts. Je constate en effet que l’accès à l’Internet à haut débit a réduit le coût de la dette
des petites entreprises de 4,9% sur la période. Cette étude est directement liée au chapitre
4, co-écrit avec Clément Malgouyres et Thierry Mayer, dans lequel nous étudions le rôle
de l’Internet haut-débit dans la réduction des frictions de recherche auxquelles sont con-
frontés les importateurs français. Nous documentons la présence de commerce ”induit par
la technologie” en France entre 1997 et 2007 et évaluons son impact sur le bien-être des con-
sommateurs. Nous utilisons le déploiement progressif de l’Internet à haut débit pour estimer
son effet causal sur le comportement d’importation des entreprises concernées. En utilisant
un modèle d’event study, nous montrons que l’expansion du haut débit augmente les impor-
tations au niveau des entreprises d’environ 25 %. Nous constatons également que la marge
”sous-extensive” (nombre de produits et de pays d’approvisionnement par entreprise) est le
principal canal d’ajustement et que l’effet est plus important pour les biens d’équipement.

Parrallèlement à l’étude de l’acquisition d’information, une littérature largement distincte a
identifié l’importance cruciale des asymmétries d’information (Akerlof, 1970; Spence, 1973;
Stiglitz, 1975; Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981) qui affectent les transactions lorsque l’un des agents
économiques dispose de plus d’information – ou d’une meilleure information – que l’autre.
En particulier, les idées fondamentales sur les asymétries d’information développées dans les
années 1970 continuent de jouer un rôle clé en économie bancaire et en finance d’entreprise.


                                                 5


Cette littérature a en effet mis en évidence l’importance des relations de long-terme entre
les banques et entreprises dans l’atténuation des agency frictions et donc dans l’allocation
du crédit (cf. Boot, 2000; Degryse et al., 2009; Udell, 2015). Les banques, en développant
des relations étroites avec les emprunteurs au fil du temps, augmentent leurs capacités à
suivre et à contrôler contrôler les activités de leurs clients. Dans le chapitre 2, co-écrit
avec Anne Duquerroy, Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier et Daniel Paravisini, nous montrons que
la différenciation et la spécialisation peuvent également permettre aux banques de réduire
les asymétries d’information et ainsi de gagner en pouvoir de marché. En utilisant des
données micro-économiques de relations entre les banques et de petites entreprises (PME)
en France, nous montrons que les banques se spécialisent localement (au niveau de l’agence
bancaire) par industrie, et que cette spécialisation affecte le montant d’équilibre des crédits
octroyés aux petites entreprises. Pour identifier l’impact de la spécialisation, nous ex-
ploitons la réallocation des clients d’agences bancaires fermées vers des agences voisines
(de la même banque), ce qui provoque une variation quasi-aléatoire dans la correspondance
entre l’industrie d’une entreprise et l’industrie de spécialisation de l’agence prêteuse. Nous
montrons que la réaffectation des agences bancaires entraı̂ne, en moyenne, une baisse sub-
stantielle et permanente du crédit octroyé aux petites entreprises. Cette baisse est deux fois
plus importante pour les entreprises dont les comptes sont réaffectés vers des agences moins
spécialisées dans leur secteur que leur agence d’origine.

Finalement, dans le chapitre 3, co-écrit avec Yasser Boualam, nous étudions l’effet des fric-
tions informationnelles sur l’allocation du crédit aux entreprises, d’un point de vue macro-
économique. Alors que la plupart des modèles en macro-finance font abstraction de la nature
de long terme des relations de crédit et de toutes les frictions qui empêchent les banques
de former ou de rompre sans coût ces relations de crédit, nous proposons une nouvelle per-
spective macro-économique sur le processus d’intermédiation du crédit. Nous fournissons
en particulier des évidences empiriques sur les rôles clés et distincts joués par les marges
intensive et extensive dans les fluctuations agrégées du crédit. Nous posons des questions
simples, mais de premier ordre telles que : (i) Lorsque le crédit bancaire agrégé diminue de
5%, est-ce parce que la taille moyenne des prêts (c’est-à-dire la marge intensive) diminue de
5%, ou est-ce parce que 5% des relations banque-entreprise (c’est-à-dire la marge extensive)
sont détruites ? (ii) L’origine des fluctuations du crédit agrégé a-t-elle une importance ? (iii)
Les chocs de politique monétaire ont-ils un impact différent sur ces marges ?

Chapitre 1: Les frictions de recherche dans les marchés
du crédit
Il est coûteux pour les entreprises de trouver le bon partenaire bancaire, en particulier pour
les petites et moyennes entreprises (PME) qui consacrent du temps et des ressources à ce
processus de recherche. Les petites entreprises multiplient en effet les demandes de prêt (2,7
en moyenne) et entreprennent un processus de demande fastidieux : en moyenne, plus de
33 heures sont consacrées aux formalités administratives de demande de prêt. Globalement,
environ un tiers des PME déplorent un processus de demande de crédit difficile et long. Alors
que l’effet des asymétries d’information sur l’attribution des crédits a été bien documenté (cf.
Akerlof, 1970; Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981; Petersen and Rajan, 1995), on sait peu de choses sur
la façon dont les frictions de recherche affectent l’appariement banque-entreprise et l’accès
au crédit. Comprendre le rôle des frictions de recherche est particulièrement important pour
les décideurs politiques, non seulement parce que les récents développements en matière
de technologie de l’information et de numérisation dans le secteur bancaire sont susceptibles
d’affecter les frictions de recherche, mais aussi parce que les politiques qui réduisent les coûts
de recherche peuvent différer sensiblement des politiques qui réduisent les frictions d’agence
traditionnelles.

La première contribution de cet article est de développer une théorie de l’appariement (match-
ing) entreprise-banque soumis à des frictions informationnelles. Cette théorie est motivée
par de nouveaux faits stylisés que je documentes sur les marchés locaux du crédit en France
: j’utilise pour cela une base de données unique sur les prêts aux petites entreprises de 1998
à 2005 qui me permet de mettre en exergue plusieurs faits stylisées sur la dispersion des taux
des prêts, l’hétérogénéité des agences bancaires et les flux de crédit entre villes qui suggèrent,
en plus de données d’enquête, la présence de frictions de recherche sur les marchés du crédit.
Je développe ensuite un modèle d’équilibre partiel d’appariement entreprise-banque qui ex-
plique les faits observés dans les données.1 Le modèle comporte une double hétérogénéité
(agences bancaires et entreprises) et des frictions d’information de deux types. Premièrement,
les frictions de recherche entravent la capacité des entreprises à localiser et à trouver le bon
partenaire financier. Deuxièmement, lors de l’appariement, les asymétries d’information af-
fectent la capacité des banques à sélectionner et à monitorer correctement les projets. En
ajoutant cette structure au processus de recherche et d’appariement entre firmes et ban-
ques, je génère un certain nombre de prédictions théoriques liant le niveau des frictions de
   1
    D’un point de vue de la modélisation, mon approche est similaire à Eaton et al. (2018) et Lenoir et al.
(2018).

recherche (i) au coût de la dette pour les petites entreprises, (ii) aux flux de crédit entre les
villes et (iii) à la dynamique de l’appariement entreprise-banque. En particulier, l’intuition
du modèle peut se résumer ainsi: lorsque les coûts de recherche diminuent, les entreprises
rencontrent davantage de prêteurs potentiels et finissent par emprunter à un taux plus faible.

La deuxième contribution de l’article consiste à confronter le modèle aux données micro
économiques. En pratique, je teste les principales prédictions de mon modèle en utilisant
la diffusion progressive de l’Internet haut-débit (BI) en France, de 1999 à 2007, comme un
choc sur les frictions de recherche. J’utilise ensuite ces résultats d’estimations empiriques
pour quantifier une réduction du coût de l’endettement des PME françaises induite par la
technologie. La large diffusion des technologies de l’information et de la communication a en
effet représenté un changement profond pour le secteur bancaire et l’Internet à haut débit
a été le catalyseur de cette transformation numérique. Avec la numérisation, les coûts de
transaction ont diminué et l’essor des services financiers en ligne a permis aux entreprises
de rechercher le meilleur partenaire bancaire de manière plus rapide et plus efficace, ce qui
a entraı̂né des changements structurels sur le marché bancaire (Hauswald and Marquez,
2003). Kroszner and Strahan (1999) a montré comment l’adoption massive des technologies
de l’information a réduit la dépendance de la proximité géographique entre les clients et les
banques, et Petersen and Rajan (2002) a documenté l’érosion de la nature locale des prêts
aux petites entreprises, avec une distance croissante entre celles-ci et leurs prêteurs aux États-
Unis, mais aussi avec de nouvelles habitudes de communication. Des tendances similaires
sont observées en France : les flux de crédit inter régionaux ont augmenté de 15% et la
distance moyenne entre les entreprises et les banques a augmenté de 10% entre 1998 et 2005.
Mon approche empirique fournit une interprétation causale de ces faits, suggérant que les
innovations dans les technologies de l’information - la diffusion de l’Internet à haut débit - ont
réduit le rôle des coûts de transaction et de recherche dans l’allocation du crédit, permettant
aux entreprises de rechercher des crédits plus loin et conduisant à des changements structurels
dans les marchés de crédit locaux.

L’identification de l’effet causal de l’adoption d’une nouvelle technologie sur l’appariement
entreprise-banque et l’allocation du crédit est difficile en raison de son endogénéité. Les
données et le contexte français me permettent de progresser dans cette direction. La troisième
contribution de cet article est ainsi de proposer une stratégie d’identification innovante.
Celle-ci repose sur une variable instrumentale pour le timing de l’expansion de l’Internet
à haut-débit, basée sur un plan théorique d’investissement dans les infrastructures de télé-
communication. J’utilise des données sur la disponibilité de l’Internet haut-débit au niveau
des municipalités sur la période 1999-2007 compilé par Malgouyres (2017) et je le com-

bine avec des informations concernant la densité de population et les infrastructures de
télécommunications existantes, à savoir les boucles locales en cuivre et les câbles à fibre
optique. Comme les opérateurs de l’Internet haut débit s’appuient sur ces infrastructures
déjà existantes pour déployer progressivement le haut débit, je montre que le timing opti-
mal de l’arrivée du haut débit peut être prédit à l’aide de ces données, sans informations
supplémentaires concernant les conditions économiques locales.

Mes résultats montrent de manière causale que les frictions de recherche affectent l’appariement
entreprise-banque et l’allocation du crédit bancaire. Premièrement, je constate que les flux de
crédit entre les villes suivent une équation de gravité qui est déformée par le déploiement pro-
gressif de l’ADSL. La réduction des frictions de recherche induite par ce choc technologique
provoque en effet une augmentation moyenne de 6% de la part du crédit échangé entre
les villes inter connectées. Conformément aux prédictions du modèle, cet effet varie con-
sidérablement avec le niveau initial des frictions de recherche : il est plus élevé lorsque
deux villes très éloignées sont connectées. Au contraire, l’effet est négatif lorsque deux
villes voisines, déjà très liées économiquement, sont connectées par internet. En termes de
robustesse, je mène un exercice de simulation pour tester la performance de l’estimateur Pois-
son pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) utilisé pour l’estimation des équations de gravité
dans un cadre dynamique (panel) et avec de nombreux zéros, étendant ainsi le travail de
Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006, 2011). Je confirme ainsi que l’estimateur PPML avec effets
fixes n’est pas biaisé et estime de manière satisfaisante l’effet d’un choc variant dans le temps,
même avec plus de 90 % de zéros. Je montre également que mes résultats de base ne sont
pas affectés par l’ajout d’effets fixes dyadiques et ni par l’ajout de la variable dépendante
retardée comme covariable.

Mes principaux résultats reposent sur des régressions effectuées au niveau des unités urbaines.
Cependant, certaines prédictions du modèle à un niveau moins agrégé nécessitent l’utilisation
de données au niveau des agences bancaires. En testant ces prédictions à un niveau désagrégé,
je montre que la diffusion de l’Internet à haut débit permet aux banques de financer de
nouvelles entreprises situées dans des marchés éloignés. Les banques connectées augmentent
de 10% leur part de crédit aux entreprises situées en dehors de leur ville, et de près de
12% leur part de clients éloignés. Par conséquent, la distance moyenne entre une banque
et ses clients augmente de 10%, 5 ans après l’accès à l’Internet haut débit. Ces résultats
sont robustes à plusieurs menaces potentielles d’identification. Mes résultats d’estimation
dynamiques au niveau des agences bancaires ne révèlent aucune tendance (pre-trend ) avant la
date de connexion à l’ADSL et l’ajout de variables de contrôle n’affecte pas mes estimations.
Enfin, je quantifie les implications de mes résultats empiriques sur le coût de la dette pour les

petites entreprises, à travers le prisme de mon modèle. En pratique, j’intègre mes estimations
empiriques dans l’équation reliant les frictions de recherche aux prix des prêts. Interprétées
dans le cadre de mon modèle, les résultats de mes estimations impliquent que la réduction
des frictions de recherche due à la diffusion de l’ADSL a fait baisser le coût de la dette des
petites entreprises de 4,9% en moyenne. Cette réduction du coût de la dette présente une
hétérogénéité spatiale intéressante. Elle est plus forte dans les zones rurales et les villes
moyennes que dans les grandes villes françaises. Les entreprises initialement situées loin
des agences bancaires, ou qui ne disposaient pas d’une grande variété de contacts bancaires
potentiels, bénéficient donc davantage de la réduction des frictions de recherche, car elle
leur permet de trouver de nouveaux ou de meilleurs partenaires bancaires. A cet égard,
ce chapitre suggère que la diffusion de l’Internet haut-débit réduit les inégalités spatiales
d’accès au crédit.


Chapter 2: La spécialisation locale des banques
Dans ce chapitre, co-écrit avec Anne Duquerroy, Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier et Daniel Par-
avisini, nous montrons comment la différenciation et la spécialisation bancaire permettent
aux banques de réduire les asymétries d’information et d’augmenter leur pouvoir de marché.

Les fermetures et consolidations d’agences bancaires en Europe et aux États-Unis après la
Grande Récession ont relancé le débat politique et universitaire sur la nature et les im-
plications du pouvoir de marché des banques. Un vaste corpus de travaux théoriques et
empiriques, commençant avec Rajan (1992), a exploré une des sources de ce pouvoir de
marché : le monopole informationnel obtenu grâce aux prêts dits relationnels (relationship
lending). Moins étudié – mais d’une importance potentiellement égale – le pouvoir de marché
acquis par la différenciation et la spécialisation est le sujet de ce chapitre. L’idée est la suiv-
ante: les prêteurs, qui semblent se livrer une concurrence féroce sur un marché du crédit,
pourraient en fait jouir d’un grand pouvoir de marché dans certains segments du marché en
adaptant leurs produits et services à des clients, des industries ou des types de financement
particuliers. Une telle segmentation du marché du crédit peut avoir des implications de
premier ordre sur l’accès au crédit des petites entreprises opaques et dépendantes des ban-
ques, ainsi que sur son coût. Documenter dans quelle mesure les banques se spécialisent sur
un marché segmenté du crédit aux petites entreprises, et évaluer si la spécialisation confère
un pouvoir de marché, est un problème de taille en matière de données et mais également
d’identification, que nous tentons de résoudre dans ce chapitre.

Nous utilisons des données réglementaires uniques qui contiennent, pour l’univers des re-


                                                 10


lations banques-entreprises en France, l’identité et la localisation de la succursale bancaire
fournissant le crédit. Grâce à ces données, nous construisons des mesures de la spécialisation
sectorielle des banques et des succursales bancaires sur des marchés géographiques du crédit.
La figure 2.1 fournit des éléments de motivation pour notre étude. Elle représente deux
mesures différentes de la concentration du marché du crédit, par unité urbaine. La figure
de gauche montre la mesure de concentration standard, calculée à partir de la part totale
des prêts. La figure de droite montre la moyenne des concentrations de crédit calculées par
secteur d’activité, qui tient compte de la segmentation du marché. La différence entre ces
deux mesures est théoriquement plus importante lorsque le marché du crédit est segmenté
par industrie (par exemple, les deux mesures seront identiques si tous les portefeuilles de
prêts bancaires ont la même composition par industrie). En effet, la fraction des unités ur-
baines présentant un niveau de concentration très élevé (HHI > 0,4) passe de 21% lorsqu’elle
est mesurée de manière traditionnelle, à 49% lorsqu’elle est mesurée en tenant compte de la
segmentation du crédit par industrie (cf. tableau 2.9 pour plus de détails). Ce fait stylisé
indique une forte segmentation sectorielle sur le marché du crédit bancaire aux petites en-
treprises.

L’objectif principal de notre analyse empirique est d’explorer les implications de la segmen-
tation du marché du crédit sur l’accès des petites entreprises au crédit. L’hypothèse sur
laquelle repose cette idée est que, pour une entreprise, l’élasticité de substitution du crédit
provenant de banques différentes est plus faible lorsque les banques spécialisées offrent des
services différenciés. Par exemple, une entreprise du secteur de la construction trouvera
plus difficile ou plus coûteux de substituer le crédit obtenu auprès de la banque (ou de la
succursale) spécialisée dans le secteur de la construction que le crédit obtenu auprès d’une
banque (ou d’une succursale) généraliste. Une première étape nécessaire consiste à évaluer
l’unité d’analyse pertinente pour étudier la spécialisation. En d’autres termes, les banques
se spécialisent-elles entièrement par secteur d’activité ? Ou bien la spécialisation est-elle un
phénomène local, au niveau de l’agence ?

Pour répondre à cette question, nous adoptons l’approche développée dans Paravisini et al.
(2017) pour identifier le secteur de spécialisation des banques, en repérant des parts de
portefeuille dédiées à une industrie particulière anormalement élevées. L’intuition de la
mesure nécessite un exemple, par soucis de clarté. Supposons que 20% des crédits bancaires
d’une zone urbaine soient destinés au secteur de la construction et soient accordés par cinq
banques. Les banques sont hétérogènes : alors que quatre banques allouent moins de 10%
de leur portefeuille de prêts à la construction, la cinquième banque alloue plus de 40%

spécialiste du secteur de la construction pour cette zone urbaine. L’avantage d’utiliser les
parts de portefeuille pour détecter les banques spécialisées est que l’identification du secteur
de spécialisation n’est pas affectée par la taille du secteur ou par la part de marché de chaque
banque dans un endroit donné.

Deux faits stylisés importants ressortent de cet exercice : les succursales bancaires ont
tendance à se spécialiser par secteur, mais les différentes succursales d’une même banque
présentent généralement des spécialisations industrielles différentes. Plus d’un tiers des
agences bancaires en France sont spécialisées dans l’octroi de crédits aux petites entreprises
dans au moins un secteur d’activité spécifique. La plupart des zones urbaines comptent des
agences bancaires spécialisées. De plus, nous observons que la plupart des industries sont
représentées par des agences bancaires spécialisées au niveau local. Par exemple, environ
9% des agences bancaires présentes dans notre échantillon en 2017 sont spécialisées dans le
financement des activités de transport et de stockage. Globalement, cela implique qu’une
PME française a une probabilité non négligeable d’être connectée à une agence spécialisée
dans son type d’activité. Lorsque nous étudions les schémas de spécialisation des agences
au sein des banques, nous constatons que les grandes banques se caractérisent par une part
importante de succursales spécialisées (37% pour la banque moyenne comptant plus de 10
succursales). Cependant, au sein d’une même banque, les différentes succursales ont ten-
dance à être spécialisées dans des secteurs différents. En bref, la spécialisation sectorielle
apparaı̂t dans les données comme un phénomène répandu mais local, qui intervient au niveau
des agences bancaires.

Motivés par ces faits stylisés nouveaux, nous nous tournons vers la mesure de l’hétérogénéité
de l’élasticité de substitution du crédit des entreprises en fonction de la spécialisation des
branches. Notre cadre empirique exploite les réaffectations des emprunteurs entre agences
bancaires en raison des fermetures de ces agences. Parmi les agences bancaires actives
dans le domaine des prêts aux PME, quelque 700 agences ont été fermées au cours de
notre période d’étude (entre 2010 et 2017) dans l’ensemble du pays, en raison de plans
de restructuration interne des activités de détail des principales banques. Les fermetures
d’agences n’ont pas mis fin aux relations entre les banques et les emprunteurs : tous les
comptes de prêts d’une agence en cours de fermeture ont été transférés vers des succursales
voisines de la même banque. La réaffectation des agences induit ainsi une variation de la
correspondance entre le secteur d’activité de l’emprunteur et le secteur de spécialisation de
la succursale, que nous exploitons pour mesurer l’hétérogénéité de l’élasticité de substitution
du crédit. Dans l’exemple de l’entreprise de construction ci-dessus, lorsque les services de
l’agence sont segmentés par secteur, le transfert du compte de l’entreprise vers une autre


                                                 12


agence généraliste devrait réduire le montant d’équilibre du crédit utilisé par l’entreprise, par
rapport à un contrefactuel dans lequel le compte serait transféré vers une autre succursale
également spécialisée dans le secteur de la construction. Les fermetures de succursales se
sont produites par grandes vagues, et l’identité des succursales fermées et absorbées a été
sélectionnée par le siège en fonction de critères tels que la densité bancaire locale, sans
doute sans rapport avec la demande de crédit des entreprises individuelles. La nature très
désagrégée des données permet également d’utiliser des spécifications dites saturées en effets
fixes pour absorber les chocs locaux (au niveau de l’unité urbaine), les chocs au niveau des
banques et les chocs au niveau des entreprises qui pourraient se produire en même temps
que la fermeture de la succursale.

Nous mettons d’abord en exergue une baisse significative du total des crédits accordés par
une banque à une petite entreprise lorsque le compte de cette dernière est réaffecté à une
nouvelle agence. En incluant les lignes de crédit non utilisées, le crédit total diminue de 12%
en moyenne au cours des trois années suivant la fermeture effective. Une partie de cette baisse
est remplacée par une augmentation des crédits accordés par d’autres banques. Cependant,
le crédit total de l’entreprise moyenne diminue de façon permanente d’environ 4% après
un transfert de compte, par rapport aux autres entreprises du même marché géographique
étroit et du même secteur. Nous documentons ensuite l’hétérogénéité de cette baisse du
crédit d’équilibre en fonction de la correspondance entre le secteur d’activité de l’emprunteur
et le secteur de spécialisation des agences qui ferment et absorbent. Nous constatons que
l’ampleur de la baisse du crédit double lorsque les comptes d’une entreprise sont réaffectés
d’une succursale spécialisée dans son secteur à une succursale qui ne l’est pas. L’ampleur de
cet effet estimé est robuste au contrôle de la variation de la distance associée à la fermeture
de la succursale. Nous constatons également que la baisse du crédit après la fermeture d’une
succursale s’explique entièrement par la variation de la spécialisation sectorielle entre les
succursales lorsque la nouvelle succursale est située dans une zone caractérisée par un niveau
élevé de concurrence bancaire. Les résultats suggèrent fortement l’existence d’un marché du
crédit bancaire segmenté, où la spécialisation des banques par industrie augmente le coût de
substitution des sources de financement bancaire pour les petites entreprises.


Chapter 3: Implications macroéconomiques des flux de
relations bancaires
Dans ce troisième chapitre, co-écrit avec Yasser Boualam, nous étudions le rôle des im-
perfections de marché dans les fluctuations du crédit aux entreprises, d’un point de vue

macroéconomique. Quels sont les moteurs des fluctuations du crédit au cours du cycle
économique et à long terme ? Comment les banques ajustent-elles leur offre de crédit en
réponse aux chocs globaux ou aux changements de politique ? Ces questions sont au premier
plan de la recherche macro-financière et bancaire au moins depuis les travaux précurseurs de
Bernanke (1983). Pourtant, notre compréhension des fluctuations globales du crédit et de
leurs implications pour l’économie réelle reste largement incomplète.

Le crédit bancaire est une source de financement importante pour la majorité des entreprises.
Un aspect particulièrement important qui a été largement étudié au niveau microéconomique,
mais négligé au niveau macroéconomique, concerne les relations de crédit entre les banques
et les entreprises. En effet, une vaste littérature théorique et empirique souligne le rôle de
ces relations qui permettent d’atténuer les frictions d’agence et affectent ainsi l’allocation du
crédit.2 Cette littérature a également souligné l’existence d’une hétérogénéité en termes de
qualité de l’appariement et des caractéristiques inhérentes à la relation, telles que la durée,
qui peut potentiellement entraver la capacité des banques à ajuster leur offre de crédit sans
friction (Boualam (2018)). À l’inverse, la plupart des modèles macrofinanciers supposent
simplement que les emprunteurs et/ou les prêteurs sont homogènes, ou font abstraction de la
nature de long-terme des contrats financiers et des frictions de marché qui peuvent empêcher
les banques de former ou de rompre sans coût ces relations de crédit. Ces modèles minimisent
donc l’importance des relations bancaires et impliquent que les banques puissent rapidement
ajuster le nombre de leurs emprunteurs en réponse à des chocs. Ils laissent également peu
de place à l’analyse du processus de réallocation du crédit entre les appariements banque-
entreprise et de sa dynamique tout au long du cycle.

Dans ce chapitre, nous proposons une nouvelle perspective macroéconomique sur le processus
d’intermédiation du crédit. Nous tentons de fournir des évidences empiriques nouvelles sur
les rôles clés et distincts que jouent les marges intensive et extensive dans les fluctuations
agrégées du crédit. Nous essayons ainsi de répondre à des questions simples, mais de premier
ordre telles que : (i) Lorsque le crédit bancaire agrégé diminue de 5%, est-ce parce que la
taille moyenne des prêts (c’est-à-dire la marge intensive) diminue de 5%, ou est-ce parce
que 5% des appariements banque-entreprise (c’est-à-dire la marge extensive) sont détruits ?
(ii) L’origine des fluctuations du crédit agrégé a-t-elle une importance ? (iii) Les chocs de
politique monétaire ont-ils un impact différent sur ces marges ?

À notre connaissance, nous sommes les premiers à montrer que les banques ajustent ac-
tivement à la fois le nombre et l’intensité de leurs relations, en réponse à des chocs macro
économiques, et que ces deux marges représentent une source significative de la variation du

total des prêts bancaires. Ces ajustements sont analogues à la manière dont les entreprises
ajustent constamment à la fois la quantité d’heures travaillées et l’emploi. Ce point de vue
peut sembler intuitif, pourtant — et de façon surprenante — une analyse approfondie de
la dynamique de ces marges et de leurs implications macroéconomiques reste limitée, voire
totalement absente de la littérature. En outre, nous établissons non seulement l’importance
quantitative de ces marges, mais nous soutenons également qu’elles sont soumises à des com-
portements agrégés très différents. Ainsi, démêler les effets associés à chaque marge peut
s’avérer instructif sur les mécanismes économiques en jeu et le rôle de la réallocation du
crédit, et finalement produire des implications politiques pertinentes.

Pour faire la lumière sur ce processus, nous nous appuyons sur une source d’information
essentielle, le registre français des crédits, qui couvre le marché des prêts commerciaux en
France, et qui est maintenu par la Banque de France. Les données granulaires et quasi
exhaustives permettent de suivre les appariements entre banques et entreprises et les exposi-
tions au crédit correspondantes sur la période 1998-2018. Pour étudier les propriétés des flux
de relations de crédit, nous développons une méthodologie empirique semblable à celle mise
en place par Davis and Haltiwanger (1992) pour les flux de travailleurs. Notre méthodologie
prend en considération les caractéristiques spécifiques associées à la structure du marché du
crédit et les limitations des données disponibles. Par exemple, nous suivons les entrées et
les sorties de chaque correspondance banque-entreprise afin de déterminer le moment de la
création et le moment supposé de la destruction de la relation, afin de construire des flux
bruts de relations de crédit. Nous tenons également compte de l’hétérogénéité en coupe
des caractéristiques des relations et des contrats financiers (la taille du prêt, le type et la
maturité du crédit, et la durée de la relation).

Comprendre les implications macroéconomiques des flux de relations de crédit entre banques
et entreprises est, comme nous l’avons montré, une entreprise assez naturelle. L’absence de
faits empiriques sur le sujet découle directement d’un manque des données microéconomiques,
en particulier sur une période suffisamment longue. Les études antérieures, telles que
Dell’Ariccia and Garibaldi (2005), reposaient sur des données agrégées au niveau des banques.
Elles ne permettent donc pas d’identifier les emprunteurs, ni observer les flux de relations
bancaires (ou seulement les flux nets, au niveau de la banque). Par conséquent, ces études
ne peuvent pas distinguer les marges extensives des marges intensives, ni saisir précisément
l’ampleur et les propriétés sous-jacentes de la réallocation du crédit. Au contraire, nous
proposons ici une nouvelle approche pour exploiter les informations disponibles dans les reg-
istres de crédit, qui sont généralement utilisées dans des contextes microéconomiques, afin
de mettre en exergue de nouveaux résultats agrégés. Notre recherche établit les faits stylisés

suivants concernant les marges extensive et intensive du crédit :

   1. Les marges extensives et intensives du crédit fluctuent continuellement dans le temps.
      Si leur tendance de long-terme est à peu près identique, la volatilité de la marge
      intensive est relativement plus élevée.
   2. Les deux marges sont importantes pour expliquer les fluctuations du crédit au cours
      d’un cycle économique, la marge extensive contribuant entre un quart et la moitié de
      la variance du crédit agrégé.
   3. A long terme, la marge extensive représente l’essentiel des variations du crédit global.

Notre analyse met également en évidence les caractéristiques suivantes concernant les flux
bruts des relations de crédit :

   1. La création, la destruction et la réaffectation des relations banques-entreprises coexis-
      tent tout au long du cycle.
   2. La création (flux entrants) et la destruction (flux sortants) des relations présentent
      une plus grande volatilité par rapport aux flux nets. Les variations des flux nets sont
      principalement dues aux flux entrants.
   3. Les sorties sont plus volatiles pour les prêts de faible montant, les prêts à court terme
      et les relations de crédit d’une durée inférieure à un an. Les entrées sont plus volatiles
      pour les relations avec de petits prêts ou des lignes de crédit.

Nos résultats soulignent également que les fluctuations (la baisse) du crédit aux entreprises
observées pendant, ou à la suite, d’une crise économique sont causées conjointement par
les marge extensives et intensives, ce qui suggère que différents mécanismes économiques
peuvent être en jeu. Une meilleure compréhension de l’origine (marge extensive/intensive)
d’une baisse du crédit peut donc être utile pour la conception d’outils de politique économique
efficaces et ciblés. Pour approfondir ce point, nous étudions comment la politique monétaire
se transmet par les canaux de la marge extensive et intensive. Nous montrons que si la
marge intensive réagit immédiatement et fortement aux surprises de la politique monétaire,
la réponse de la marge extensive est relativement plus graduelle et plus modérée. Nous
notons également que le canal de la marge extensive opère principalement pour les banques
relativement petites ou celles dont le portefeuille de prêts le plus flexible (i.e., des prêts à
court-terme).

Finalement, notre cadre empirique fournit des outils pour mieux comprendre le processus
de réallocation qui se produit sur les marchés du crédit et les canaux par lesquels les chocs
bancaires se transmettent à l’économie réelle. En particulier, nous montrons que le taux de
réallocation des relations de crédit est contracyclique, conformément à l’idée de cleansing

effect qui se produit pendant les récessions. En outre, nous montrons les taux annuels de
réallocation (excédentaire) ont diminué de manière constante au cours des deux dernières
décennies. Ces résultats indiquent l’existence de facteurs entravant la fluidité du marché du
crédit.


Chapitre 4: Technologies de l’information et de la com-
munication et commerce international : le cas du déploiement
de l’ADSL en France
Dans ce dernier chapitre, co-écrit avec Clément Malgouyres et Thierry Mayer, nous étudions
le rôle de l’Internet haut-débit dans la réduction des frictions de recherche auxquelles sont
confrontés les importateurs français.

Pour cela, nous documentons l’effet de la diffusion des technologies de l’information et de
la communication en France, entre 1997 et 2007, sur le commerce international de biens
et sur le bien-être des consommateurs. Pour cela, nous utilisons le déploiement progressif
de l’Internet haut-débit (ADSL) en France pour évaluer l’impact causal de l’accès à cette
technologie sur les importations des entreprises françaises.

En pratique, nous mobilisons des données sur les variations spatiales et temporelles d’accès
au haut débit entre communes pour comparer des entreprises bénéficiant d’un accès à celles
n’en bénéficiant pas. Nous trouvons que l’expansion de l’ADSL entraı̂ne une augmentation
de la valeur des importations de 25% au niveau de l’entreprise et que cet effet positif passe
principalement par la marge extensive (l’augmentation de la diversité des produits importés
et du nombre de partenaires commerciaux).

Nous constatons également que l’augmentation des importations françaises est particulièrement
pour des biens en provenance de Chine et d’Europe de l’Est et pour les biens d’équipement et
les biens intermédiaires. Finalement, nous développons un modèle théorique, dans lequel les
entreprises optimisent leur stratégie d’importation, qui nous permet de quantifier les effets
de l’Internet haut-débit sur le bien-être des consommateurs. Dans le cadre de ce modèle, nos
estimations impliquent que l’ADSL a réduit l’indice des prix à la consommation de 1,85% et
que le canal des importations représente un quart de cet effet.
