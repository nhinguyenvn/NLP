The human factor in classification is nowhere more evident than in dealing with this su-
perfamily [Rhinocerotoidea]. It is, as mammalian superfamilies go, well known, but what
is "known" about it is so inconsistent in places that much of it must be wrong.

Suivant cet adage plein de sagesse, la rédaction du manuscrit final a ainsi débuté par la partie la plus
essentielle à mes yeux. Le seul moyen de remercier à leur juste valeur toutes les personnes sans qui
ce travail n’aurait pu aboutir sous cette forme.

Mes trois encadrant·e·s, tout d’abord. Alexandra, merci d’avoir donné sa chance au « vieux » que je
suis, malgré mon parcours atypique et ma grande capacité à toujours tout remettre en question (d’au-
cuns diraient « râler »). Une fois habitué à ton rythme de travail « un peu » élevé ou tes mails consti-
tués uniquement d’un titre, j’ai pu mesurer la chance d’avoir une encadrante si investie au quotidien.
Merci pour tes connaissances, ta rigueur, ta confiance, tes critiques toujours constructives et toutes
tes autres qualités que je n’ai pas la place de lister.

Raphaël, la pratique de la morphométrie aurait été sans doute bien plus fastidieuse et frustrante sans
toi. Toujours questionner ce que l’on fait, remettre en question les évidences, adapter l’analyse à la
question : autant de choses, et bien d’autres encore, que j’ai développées grâce à ta disponibilité et ta
patience. Merci pour tout cela.

Guillaume, merci pour ta capacité, toi aussi, à toujours aller chercher le détail qui change tout, à me
faire me poser les bonnes questions et organiser mes propres idées. Merci également de m’avoir per-
mis de réaliser ce rêve de gosse que de travailler dans la Galerie de Paléontologie : toute la poussière
remuée durant les nombreuses sessions de scan, seul au milieu des fossiles, valait la peine d’être re-
muée.

All my gratitude goes to Stephanie Pierce, Ursula Göhlich, Peter Aerts and Pierre-Olivier Antoine who
accepted to be part of my thesis jury and evaluate my work. I hope that this work will meet your ex-
pectations. Thanks also to Sandra Nauwelaerts, Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Eric Guilbert for being part
of my thesis committee and helping me to focus and reorient my research when needed.

I would also like to thank the European Research Council (ERC) for funding this work through the pro-
ject GRAVIBONE carried by Alexandra.

Collecting more than 1,600 scans of rhino bones would have been impossible without the precious
help of all the curators of the numerous institutions I have visited during these three years. For your

special thanks also to J. Hutchinson for providing CT-scan data and for organizing together with Alex-
andra the “GraviDawn” meeting – to date, the biggest crossover in the ERC history!

Trois ans à trainer dans les couloirs des musées permettent de rencontrer beaucoup de « rhinophiles »
avec qui j’ai eu des discussions souvent éclairantes et passionnantes. Merci à Pierre-Olivier Antoine
pour les informations fournies directement par mail ou lors des comités de thèse, et pour son omni-
présence indirecte dans les réserves de musées : rares sont les collections de rhinocéros fossiles à ne
pas contenir une réattribution spécifique lui étant due. Merci à Jérémy Tissier pour les conseils avisés
concernant la phylogénie des rhinocéros, rapidement concrétisés à travers des articles qui m’ont été
fortement utiles sur la fin. Merci à Olivier Maridet de m’avoir proposé de l’accompagner, ainsi que

Jérémy, en Chine, même si cette « non-mission » est tombée à l’eau de mon côté… Une autre fois,
peut-être ! Un grand merci à Constance Bronnert pour m’avoir notamment permis de scanner les
restes de Propachynolophus, et de m’avoir même servi de pare-soleil pour réussir à les numériser !
Même s’il est plus « hippophile » que « rhinophile », un grand merci à Florian Martin pour les échanges
de données ou de scans, et les discussions sur nos grosses bêtes respectives. De même, merci à Pauline
Hanot pour les échanges à propos des périssodactyles, de l’intégration et de la morphométrie en gé-
néral.

A very special thanks to Dr. Kees Rookmaaker (Director and Chief Editor) and to all the staff of the
online database Rhino Resource Center, a priceless goldmine of studies about modern and fossil rhi-
nos. RRC contains almost 25,000 bibliographic references about rhinos in open access, many of which
cannot be found elsewhere on the Internet and are sometimes even missing from physical libraries.
Needless to say, it is an invaluable resource that I used and overused for 3 years. Thank you for your
dedication to this lifetime task. I am very proud to see my own works now joining this immense collec-
tion.

Un grand merci également aux gens croisés en congrès pour les discussions que nous avons pu avoir,
en direct ou par mail : Loïc Costeur, Manon Hullot, Miranta Kouvari, Bastien Mennecart, Maéva Orliac
et bien d’autres. Un petit coucou à Antoine Zazzo, que je ne pensais pas retrouver au Muséum après
l’avoir rencontré dans les steppes mongoles. Un merci également à Thomas Cucchi pour avoir remis
des pétreux sur mon chemin quand je pensais en avoir fini avec eux (on n’en est jamais débarrassé, et
puis je les aime bien quand même). Et pardon à celles et ceux que j’oublie certainement.

Another very special thanks for Jamie MacLaren, first met in a dark basement of the Galerie de Palé-
ontologie, but soon became a recurrent interlocutor when talking about fossil tapirs and rhinos. Many
thanks for your help, the numerous exchanged mails and the passionate discussions about metacar-
pals, centre of mass and other functional stuff. I hope that, despite your newfound passion for mosa-
saur skulls, we will be able to talk about Perissodactyla and collaborate again!

En plus de l’encadrement quasi-idéal (n’exagérons rien) dont j’ai bénéficié pendant trois ans, j’ai éga-
lement eu la chance d’être accueilli dans un laboratoire rempli de personnes d’une grande qualité
scientifique et humaine. Merci donc à Fabienne, Anick, Emmanuelle, Anthony, Marc et à toutes celles
et ceux que j’oublie et qui m’ont permis de me sentir moins déraciné au milieu de la capitale. Un merci
particulier à Pauline pour les discussions scientifiques et sociétales, ainsi que quelques belles manifes-
tations ensemble ! Merci également à Christine pour les nombreux fous rires tous ensemble à la can-
tine, entrecoupés de discussions myologiques ou de passages en allemand quand Alex ne voulait pas
que les « petits » entendent ce qu’elle avait à dire… Un grand merci aux « ancien·ne·s » thésard·e·s qui

partaient quand j’arrivais : Ameline qui m’a permis de trouver un appartement sans même chercher
(un bien précieux à Paris !), Marion pour m’avoir fait visiter quelques coulisses du Muséum à New York,
Léo pour les précieux conseils sur R et ses travaux qui m’ont beaucoup trop servi de modèle.

À plus petite échelle, je ne peux bien sûr pas oublier l’équipe dans l’équipe que forme le groupe GRA-
VIBONE autour d’Alexandra. Que de bons moments à parler de graviportalité, de dinosaures et de
grosses bêtes, ou juste à partager une galette des rois ou un verre bien mérité. Ronan, le grand dino-
saurologue, merci pour ta sympathie et ta bonne humeur contagieuse. Un immense merci également
à Arnaud pour tous les coups de main sur les outils 3D, ainsi que les nombreux fous rires avec Raphaël.
Sans oublier bien sûr Andréa et le camarade Alexis, parmi les premiers arrivés et à essuyer les plâtres
sur le scanner et la photogrammétrie, ainsi que Clémentin et Kinga qui ont passé quelques heures à
reconstruire des modèles 3D. Une pensée aussi pour les M1 et M2 croisé·e·s pendant 3 ans : Manon,
Lou, Adrien, Kévin, Morgane, Charlène, Guillaume. Et bien sûr Camille, la seule autre personne que je
connaisse à avoir fait son M2 sur les pétreux de mouton : rien que pour ça, nous sommes liés, désor-
mais ! Merci pour tous les coups de main réciproques sur R, les manifs et les fermetures de bars avec
Colline !

Le Muséum est une grande fourmilière dans laquelle j’ai pu croiser quantité de gens adorables avec
qui discuter et/ou blaguer a toujours été un plaisir. Tour d’horizon non-exhaustif (que les personnes
oubliées ici me pardonnent) : Kévin, intarissable sur l’allométrie, la morphométrie et le pommeau,
Morgane « la gauchiste », Jordan, avec qui j’ai virtuellement partagé un bureau pendant 5 mois, Anne-
Sophie que j’ai retrouvé dans le bureau voisin après une première rencontre en 2010 en fouille dans
le Vaucluse (le monde est petit), Mathilde et Valentine qui ont supporté mes crises de rage sur R au
bâtiment 139, Léa et Margot pour les bons moments à l’ICVM et dans les brasseries tchèques. Sans
oublier les autres thésard·e·s de l’ED 227 pour la super semaine passée à Concarneau. Une pensée bien
sûr aux camarades en lutte contre la LPPR que j’ai pu croiser dans les AG du muséum : on commençait
à tenir quelque chose avant que la pandémie ne nous coupe l’herbe sous le pied, mais le combat con-
tinue !

Enfin, les collègues de fortune et d’infortune, la clique de thésard·e·s de FUNEVOL, toujours là pour
débugger un script, boire une bière ou juste se plaindre et râler tous ensemble (notre pêché mignon).
Fanny et ses oiseaux, coincée entre les « anciens » et les « nouveaux » thésards, avec qui on s’est trop
souvent lamenté sur l’efficacité de nos ordinateurs ; Colline et ses renards, la transfuge d’archéozoo
et son milliard de têtes de chiens dans une poubelle ; Maxime et ses vomis de lézard, toujours présent
pour déconner et réciter les répliques de Kaamelott ou du Palmashow en boucle ; Rohan et son poisson

a râlé et stressé mais c’était quand même 3 belles années, non ? Bien sûr, un grand merci et beaucoup
de courage à la génération d’après : Ana, Marjorie, Julie, Priscilla, et Laurie tout récemment, ça va bien
se passer. Bien se passer. Un énorme merci également à Cyril et Romain, à qui ça n’a visiblement pas
servi de leçon de nous voir galérer et qui ont quand même décidé d’aller en thèse. C’est audacieux.
L’entraide permanente autour des pauses-café, il n’y a rien de mieux, merci à vous. Et enfin, un merci
tout particulier au camarade Rémi, pour ces échanges infinis sur tous les sujets ou presque, jusqu’à en
arriver à la conclusion que « en fait, tout ce qu’on fait est faux ». Promis, j’irai une dernière fois aux
Korrigans avant de partir, je te dois bien ça pour toute l’aide fournie pendant 3 ans !

Et maintenant, la vie d’avant la thèse. Pour toutes les personnes à qui j’ai dit « là, je cherche une
thèse » pendant environ 5 ans, souvent sans trop y croire moi-même. Merci d’y avoir cru (ou fait sem-
blant d’y croire). Un grand merci à l’équipe du Musée du Grand-Pressigny, avec qui j’ai passé 2 saisons
formidables et où j’ai tant appris. Michel, Frédéric, Laure-Anne, Valérianne et toute l’équipe, mille
mercis. De même, une pensée pour l’équipe de la Maison de la Dame de Brassempouy, pour cette
autre année riche (et intense) au pays de l’armagnac. Lionel, Estéle, Coralie, Ophélie, Johanne, Chris-
tophe, Ludivine, Mathieu, David et celles et ceux que j’oublie, à très vite en Chalosse.

Une pensée toute particulière va à Jean-Luc Guadelli, mon mentor en anatomie comparée, en réflexion
et rigueur scientifique. Que de bons moments à parler anatomie crânienne, os pétreux, Préhistoire,
puis à dériver sur les guerres napoléoniennes, la géopolitique mondiale et l’eau-de-vie de prune mai-
son. Que de galères à Pradayrol, que de bases de données et mails perdus, que de pannes de voiture.
Mais que de bons souvenirs et de leçons apprises. Merci pour tout.

De même, mon passage à Lyon m’a permis de rencontrer Gildas Merceron, que je remercie pour son
soutien et son enthousiasme qui n’ont pas diminué depuis 2012. Comment ne pas évoquer également
Jean-Baptiste Fourvel, qui m’a quasiment tout appris du squelette postcrânien à l’été 2010 lorsque l’on
triait les milliers de restes de lièvre du Coulet des Roches ? Et tant que j’en suis à évoquer le sud de la
France, un grand merci à Evelyne Crégut pour son soutien et sa gentillesse, ainsi qu’à Jean-Philip Bru-
gal, qui a tant essayé de me trouver un sujet de thèse (en vain). Je n'oublie pas non plus Antigone
Uzunidis, rhinophile du Pléistocène avec qui nous aurons beaucoup à échanger maintenant que cette
thèse est finie !

Dix années à Bordeaux laissent des traces et des amitiés. Merci donc à Antoine « le suidologue » et
Sohee pour le soutien et l’enthousiasme sans faille, et les discussions concernant les pétreux pendant

lycée qui se retrouvent tous à Paris 15 ans plus tard, ça ferait vraiment un très mauvais scénario de

Comment ne pas évoquer les copains du net rencontrés sur NDM et devenus pour certains des copains
dans la vraie vie ? Merci à vous tous pour ces 15 ans de vie virtuelle et pourtant bien réelle, et pour
tous les délires et les dramas vécus. Le lécheur de cailloux a enfin fini sa thèse, ilménite à tous. Et un
merci particulier à Keryan « Xeto(s) » Didier et à Arnaud « Nens » Paris respectivement pour l’héber-
gement lors de mon entretien pour l’obtention de la thèse et lors de ma mission à Toulouse. De même,
un immense merci à Raphaël Pezet et toute l’équipe de Pix’n Love de me permettre d’écrire des bou-
quins sur les jeux vidéo, et me changer les idées quand je sature des rhinocéros.

Cyrielle et Cyril, mon couple de lithiciens préféré, quelle chance et quel plaisir de pouvoir compter sur
votre amitié depuis toutes ces années. Axelle et Corentin, mon couple de paléontologues préféré,
quelle chance et quel plaisir de… Mince, je me répète. Reprendre un M1 après un M2 n’était pas la
meilleure décision de ma vie, sauf sur un point : je ne vous aurais sans doute jamais rencontrés et la
vie aurait été bien moins riche sans cela. Je n’oublie pas non plus Jean-Michel, mon binôme lyonnais
toujours là pour se taper des barres ou soutenir quand ça va mal. À vous cinq, enfin, merci d’avoir fait
une thèse avant moi : la mienne aurait été bien plus douloureuse à réaliser sans modèles à suivre !

Monique et Gérard, Audrey et Max, Elodie et François (et désormais Anatole), quel bonheur de vous
avoir comme belle-famille. Merci à vous tous pour votre soutien depuis toutes ces années.

Daniela, Antoine, Lucile, les meilleurs. Je ne sais même pas quoi écrire tellement on s’est tout dit depuis
plus de 10 ans. Les mots sont trop limités pour exprimer ces choses-là. Merci d’avoir été là dans les
instants les plus joyeux comme les plus tristes. Vous êtes irremplaçables.

À ma famille enfin. Tout a commencé par cet os de poulet déterré dans le jardin quand j’étais gamin.
Il doit toujours être quelque part dans un carton. Depuis, une seule idée en tête : devenir paléonto-
logue. Maman, merci d’y avoir toujours cru même si tout ça doit te sembler un peu abstrait. Cyril, je
suis tellement fier de toi. Tu as tenu bon dans les pires moments. Tu vas tout déchirer.

Et Lysianna, bien entendu. Tu as déjà tout dit dans ta propre thèse. Tu sais déjà tout. Une fois n’est pas
coutume, je vais juste me taire.

Bonus : un extrait de la bande-son de cette thèse. Car les longs voyages, les sessions de scans, de reconstruction 3D, de pose
de points et de débuggage sous R auraient été un calvaire sans tous ces artistes dans les oreilles. Merci donc à Beirut, Ben

                                        Résumé étendu
Chez les vertébrés terrestres, les os des membres sont des organes d'une importance primordiale qui
assurent le soutien du corps et sa locomotion. Leur forme est influencée par des facteurs structurels
et historiques, ainsi que des contraintes fonctionnelles, notamment la nécessité de résister aux forces
dues à la gravité. Cette contrainte de poids est très élevée chez les mammifères quadrupèdes pesant
plusieurs tonnes, ce qui entraîne des modifications morphologiques des membres afin d'éviter l'écra-
sement des os. Les mammifères quadrupèdes présentant de telles modifications architecturales de
leurs membres dues à une masse élevée ont été appelés « graviporteurs » (par opposition à « cou-
reurs »). La graviportalité telle que définie historiquement est marquée par un allongement du stylo-
pode et un raccourcissement de l’autopode, une masse corporelle de plusieurs centaines de kilos, des
membres verticaux redressés (en colonne), des os larges et robustes, des pieds larges avec des coussins
adipeux épais, des foulées longues et une incapacité à galoper. Cependant, de nombreux groupes de
quadrupèdes ne présentent pas l’ensemble de ces critères et soulignent la difficulté de donner à la
graviportalité une définition précise qui pourrait être utilisée de manière générale sur n'importe quel
taxon. De nombreuses lignées d’amniotes présentent une tendance évolutive vers une augmentation
de la masse et de la taille du corps au cours du temps, notamment la superfamille des Rhinocerotoidea
appartenant à l’ordre des Perissodactyla. Bien que seulement représentés de nos jours par 5 espèces,
les Rhinocerotoidea formaient un groupe à l’évolution florissante au cours du Cénozoïque, représenté
par des dizaines de genres fossiles parfois documentés par des centaines d’individus. Les Rhinocero-
toidea variaient de moins de 100 kg chez Hyrachyus, le plus ancien représentant de la superfamille, à
plus de 10 tonnes chez les Paraceratheriidae géants. Entre ces deux extrêmes, plusieurs lignées ont
montré des augmentations convergentes de la masse corporelle, avec de nombreuses espèces dépas-
sant une tonne ou plus. En plus de cette variation de masse, les Rhinocerotoidea présentent des fluc-
tuations de leur organisation corporelle générale (de « coureur » à « graviporteur »), de leur degré de
brachypodie (ou gracilité, c'est-à-dire une réduction de la longueur relative de leurs membres), de leurs
affinités écologiques (milieux ouverts, fermés ou modes de vie présumés semi-aquatiques), de leur
nombre de doigts du membre antérieur (main tétradactyle ou tridactyle), ou de la présence de cornes.
Pour toutes ces raisons, les Rhinocerotoidea apparaissent donc comme un groupe pertinent pour étu-
dier les relations entre la masse corporelle et la forme des os des membres, et comment une même
masse corporelle peut être associée à différentes formes corporelles. Ce travail propose donc d’explo-
rer la variation de forme des os longs des membres chez les Rhinocerotoidea par rapport à la masse et
aux proportions du corps au cours de leur histoire évolutive afin de mieux comprendre comment le
squelette se modifie pour répondre aux exigences fonctionnelles d'une locomotion coordonnée et au
soutien d'une forte masse. Pour ce faire, j’ai étudié les six os du stylopode et du zeugopode (humérus,

radius, ulna, fémur, tibia, fibula) en sélectionnant plusieurs centaines d’ossements de rhinocéros mo-
dernes et fossiles dans une vingtaine de collections. Ces ossements ont été numérisés en 3D afin de
procéder à l'analyse de leurs variations de forme via la morphométrie géométrique 3D, une approche
permettant de quantifier et visualiser les différences morphologiques entre des objets à l'aide des
coordonnées de points-repères (landmarks) placés à leur surface. Après une analyse Procrustes per-
mettant de supprimer les effets d’échelle, de rotation et de translation, les coordonnées des landmarks
ont été utilisées comme base pour les différentes analyses menées au cours de ce travail (analyses en
composantes principales, régression multivariée, test d’intégration et « Two-Block Partial Least
Squares », ANOVA Procruste).


La forme des os des rhinocéros ayant été peu explorée jusqu’à présent dans une optique morpho-
fonctionnelle, j’ai tout d’abord étudié les os longs des cinq espèces actuelles afin de comprendre com-
ment la forme varie entre ces taxons en fonction de la taille, de la masse corporelle et de la phylogénie.
Mes résultats indiquent que les cinq espèces présentent des différences morphologiques importantes
en fonction des os considérés. L'humérus et le fémur présentent des différences interspécifiques no-
tables entre les rhinocéros africains et asiatiques. La masse corporelle a un effet significatif sur la forme
de ces deux os. Le radius et le cubitus sont plus fortement corrélés à la masse corporelle également.
Alors que le tibia présente une variation de forme liée à la phylogénie et à la masse corporelle, la fibula
présente une très grande variation intraspécifique. J’ai pu mettre en évidence trois morphotypes dis-
tincts de forme osseuse, qui apparaissent en fonction de la phylogénie : un morphotype africain (rhi-
nocéros blanc [Ceratotherium simum] et rhinocéros noir [Diceros bicornis]), un morphotype « Rhino-
ceros » (rhinocéros indien [Rhinoceros unicornis] et rhinocéros de Java [Rhinoceros sondaicus]) et un
morphotype « Dicerorhinus (rhinocéros de Sumatra [Dicerorhinus sumatrensis]). L'augmentation de la
masse corporelle chez les cinq espèces existantes est marquée par une augmentation de la robustesse
générale des os, des épiphyses d’apparence plus larges et robustes, des attaches plus prononcées pour
les muscles extenseurs et un développement des diaphyses. L'influence de la masse corporelle semble
également s'exprimer de manière inégale sur les différents os : la variation de forme du zeugopode,
notamment pour le membre avant, suit davantage la variation de masse que le stylopode. Cette pre-
mière étude souligne que les caractéristiques morphologiques liées à l'augmentation de la masse cor-
porelle ne sont pas similaires entre les rhinocéros et les autres mammifères lourds tels que les élé-
phants et les hippopotames, ce qui suggère que la contrainte de poids peut entraîner des réponses
morphologiques différentes selon les taxons.


Ce premier volet de mon travail ayant mis en avant les variations observables os par os, j’ai souhaité
compléter ces résultats par une approche plus globale de la covariation de forme des os entre eux. En

effet, le squelette appendiculaire des tétrapodes est une structure particulièrement intégrée (c’est-à-
dire présentant des covariations entre ces différentes parties) en raison de l'origine commune du dé-
veloppement ou de contraintes fonctionnelles similaires exercées sur ses éléments. Parmi ces con-
traintes, la masse corporelle influence fortement son intégration, mais son effet sur la covariation des
formes a rarement été abordé chez les mammifères, en particulier chez les taxons lourds. Ce deuxième
volet de ma thèse explore donc les schémas de covariation des os longs chez les rhinocéros actuels et
leur lien avec la masse corporelle. J’ai étudié la covariation de la forme des os des membres à la fois
entre les espèces et au sein de celles-ci. Mes résultats indiquent que le squelette appendiculaire des
rhinocéros forme une structure fortement intégrée. Au niveau interspécifique, la covariation de forme
est à peu près similaire entre toutes les paires d'os. Les zones anatomiques covariantes sont principa-
lement les insertions musculaires liées aux mouvements de flexion et d'extension. L'intégration du
membre antérieur semble plus élevée et plus liée à la masse corporelle que celle du membre posté-
rieur, ce qui suggère une spécialisation pour le soutien du poids. L'intégration des éléments du stylo-
pode (humérus et fémur) ne semble pas liée à la masse corporelle, ce qui suggère un effet plus impor-
tant des facteurs de développement communs sur leur degré de covariation. À l'inverse, la covariation
des os du zeugopode semble davantage associée à la masse corporelle, en particulier pour la paire
radius-ulna. La fibula covarie faiblement avec les autres os, en particulier chez les espèces n’apparte-
nant pas au genre Rhinoceros, ce qui pourrait représenter un cas de parcellisation due à une dissocia-
tion fonctionnelle entre les os des membres postérieurs. L’exploration des patrons d'intégration au
niveau intraspécifique met également en évidence un effet plus important de l'âge que de la masse
corporelle individuelle sur la covariation des formes au sein de C. simum. Ce second volet de mon étude
vient donc appuyer les observations faites sur les os individuels, mais également l’hypothèse d’un lien
marqué entre une forte masse corporelle et un niveau d'intégration élevé.


Les deux premiers volets de cette étude m’ont permis d’appréhender la variation de forme des os longs
chez les rhinocéros actuels. Cependant, ces cinq espèces modernes ne reflètent que très partiellement
la diversité de forme, de taille et de poids rencontrées parmi les Rhinocerotoidea fossiles. Les membres
de la superfamille des Rhinocerotoidea présentent une grande variété de masse corporelle, de taille
et de proportions, allant de petites formes coureuses proches des tapirs à des espèces géantes ou à
pattes courtes (c'est-à-dire brachypodes). J’ai donc étendu mon approche à l’ensemble de la superfa-
mille, afin d’explorer la variation de forme des os des membres au sein des Rhinocerotoidea et sa
relation avec la masse, la taille et les proportions du corps. Compte tenu des altérations taphono-
miques présentées par certains fossiles (cassures, déformations), l’approche de morphométrie géo-
métrique jusqu’ici appliquée sur des os complets a été étendue à des portions d’os afin d’inclure le
maximum de taxons présentant une masse élevée.

La variation de forme des trois os du membre antérieur (humérus, radius et ulna) a été comparée avec
la taille centroïde, la masse corporelle moyenne et l'indice de gracilité calculé sur le troisième méta-
pode (largeur divisée par longueur). Mes résultats indiquent une augmentation générale de la robus-
tesse et un développement des insertions musculaires en association avec une masse corporelle et
une taille élevées. La taille centroïde apparaît comme un indicateur pertinent pour estimer la masse
corporelle. La taille centroïde et la gracilité ne sont, en revanche, pas toujours corrélées avec la forme
selon l'os considéré. J’ai ainsi observé de fortes différences entre la variation de forme du stylopode
et du zeugopode. La forme de l'humérus est influencée à la fois par la masse, la taille et la gracilité tout
en restant fortement contrainte par l’histoire évolutive des Rhinocerotoidea. Inversement, les formes
du radius et de l’ulna sont principalement liées à la gracilité, soulignant un effet plus important de la
répartition de la masse dans le corps que de la masse elle-même. En outre, la partie proximale de l’ulna
varie de la même manière que l'humérus, ce qui semble indiquer que l'articulation du coude pourrait
constituer une structure fortement covariante. Ces résultats confirment également le caractère unique
des Paraceratheriidae géants parmi les Rhinocerotoidea, présentant un mélange peu commun de va-
riation de forme liée à une masse corporelle élevée tout en conservant une construction coureuse des
membres antérieurs, remettant en question l'opposition classique entre ces deux extrêmes.


Le même cadre analytique a été appliqué sur les os du membre arrière (fémur, tibia, fibula), dont le
rôle fonctionnel diffère du membre avant (ce dernier étant davantage impliqué dans le support du
poids et le ralentissement de l’allure lors de la locomotion, alors que le membre arrière a un rôle pro-
pulseur). Des résultats similaires à ceux du membre avant ont été obtenus sur le membre arrière. Au-
delà d'une augmentation commune de la robustesse et du renforcement des insertions musculaires
chez les espèces lourdes, la forme du stylopode et du zeugopode ne suit pas les mêmes patrons de
variation. Tout comme l’humérus, la forme du fémur est intimement liée à la fois à la masse, la taille
et la gracilité, tout en restant contrainte par l’histoire évolutive de la superfamille. À l’inverse, la forme
du tibia est davantage associée aux variations de gracilité, dans une moindre mesure que sur le
membre avant. La forme de la fibula, en revanche, semble là encore dominée par de fortes variations
intraspécifiques malgré une influence du degré de gracilité. En outre, il apparait que la partie distale
du fémur présente des patrons de variations similaires à ceux observés sur le tibia, indiquant une pro-
bable covariation marquée des éléments de l'articulation du genou.


À l’issue de ces différents volets, l'étude des patrons de variation de la forme des os longs chez les
Rhinocerotoidea révèle un signal complexe, et souvent double, lié à la masse corporelle et aux propor-
tions du corps en général. D'une part, il apparaît clairement que la forme varie en partie en fonction
de la masse corporelle chez les Rhinocerotoidea. Des patrons communs très nets apparaissent, tel que

                                                     24


l’augmentation de robustesse des os, ainsi que le renforcement des insertions pour les muscles exten-
seurs. Ces deux modifications visent à résister aux contraintes de masse, particulièrement en l’absence
de membres columnaires au sein de ce groupe. D'autre part, la diversité de la forme des os par rapport
aux proportions du corps met en évidence plusieurs façons de soutenir une masse corporelle élevée
au sein de la superfamille. Des différences existent entre le membre avant et le membre arrière, pro-
bablement liées à leurs rôles fonctionnels distincts. Cependant, les différences de variation de forme
sont bien plus prononcées entre les éléments du stylopode et du zeugopode. Alors que la forme du
stylopode semble directement associée à la masse corporelle, celle du zeugopode semble davantage
liée à la répartition de cette masse dans le corps et à la position du centre de gravité de l’animal. Ainsi,
une même masse corporelle peut être associée à différentes formes d'os et, à une échelle plus large,
à différentes constructions de membres selon le groupe considéré. Inversement, on peut observer une
similitude de forme chez les taxons présentant une construction distincte. Toutes ces observations au
sein des Rhinocerotoidea questionnent ainsi le concept même de graviportalité, dont la définition ne
permet pas de couvrir la diversité morphologique de ce groupe. Les rhinocéros apparaissent comme
un compromis entre la nécessité de soutenir une forte masse corporelle et le maintien d’une locomo-
tion relativement rapide. En dehors de leur forte masse, ils ne présentent quasiment aucun autre ca-
ractère associé traditionnel aux animaux graviporteurs. La graviportalité ayant été définie principale-
ment sur la base du plan architectural des éléphants, lequel semble être une exception au sein des
mammifères lourds, elle ne peut embrasser toute la diversité morphologique présente dans d’autres
groupes présentant une forte masse comme les rhinocéros. Il apparait donc plus pertinent de recher-
cher quelles sont les caractéristiques rencontrées de manière répétée au sein de divers taxons présen-
tant une masse corporelle élevée avant de définir un concept général tel que la graviportalité.

Bones are undoubtedly the most emblematic organs of vertebrate animals, and the ones that confer
them most of their biological specificities. These mineralized organs fulfil numerous vital functions
both at microscopic and macroscopic scales. At the microscopic scale, bones constitute a stock of min-
erals constantly renewed throughout life and their marrow produces essential blood components like
erythrocytes and leukocytes (Currey, 2006; Barone, 2010a). At the macroscopic scale, bones provide
protection for inner vital organs (e.g. brain, heart or lungs) and structure the whole body allowing
notably weight support and active locomotion (Currey, 2006; Barone, 2010a). Together with muscles,
tendons, cartilages and ligaments, they form a complex musculoskeletal system of paramount im-
portance for the subsistence of vertebrates (Hildebrand, 1974). Because of their mineral composition,
they are, with teeth, among the organs that are best preserved over long-time periods through the
fossilization process, making them essential clues for reconstructing the biology and evolutionary his-
tory of vertebrates in deep time.

Like for all other organs, bone shape results from the combination of three categories of factors that
constrain and drive its variation (Seilacher, 1970, 1991; Gould, 2002; Cubo, 2004). First, bones being
submitted to physical and chemical principles, their shape is necessarily constrained by structural fac-
tors. These factors, first explored by Thompson (1917) and enhanced latter by Gould et al. (1979) can
be defined as “processes of direct physical causation during development and their morphological ex-
pression” and “physically or geometrically necessary consequences (by-products, spandrels) of other
changes” (Cubo, 2004). Structural factors act as a physical bound limiting the range of morphological
variation. Second, bone shape is constrained by historical factors. Members of a same taxonomic
group will be affected by “phylogenetic inertia” (Blomberg & Garland, 2002), i.e. the fact that they
share inherited genetic processes making the shape variation dependant of their evolutionary history.
As stated by Blomberg & Garland (2002), “once organisms begin to evolve in a particular direction, they
tend to keep evolving in the same direction”. Historical factors therefore act as another limit of the
range of morphological variation. Finally, bone shape is also submitted to functional factors. Bones
are involved in one or more essential functions in the organism, like feeding, support of body weight
or locomotion in different environments (terrestrial, arboreal, aquatic, aerial, subterranean. Moreo-
ver, bone itself is a living tissue that undergoes constant remodelling across lifetime under environ-
mental constraints to keep ensuring these required functions (Lanyon et al., 1982; Hadjidakis & An-
droulakis, 2006; Currey, 2006). Functional factors constitute therefore a third limit to bone morpho-
logical variation.

In tetrapods, bones constituting limb elements (forming, with girdles, the appendicular skeleton) play
three main roles in shaping and supporting the body, as well as providing an efficient locomotion in a
given environment. Furthermore, limb bones are intimately related to each other through joint caps

                                                      29


                                  Chapter 1 – Introduction and objectives


firmly maintained by strong ligaments, but also related to muscles attached to them with tendons and
ensuring movements (Hildebrand, 1974; Polly, 2007). Limbs constitute a system of joints and levers
that must resist the stresses exerted by static and dynamic loads during standing and locomotion
phases (Hildebrand, 1974; Biewener, 1990). Contrary to flying or swimming vertebrates that undergo
different external forces (respectively, air lift and buoyancy), exclusive terrestrial quadrupeds are sub-
ject to one dominant external constraint: gravity (Ross, 1984). In this context, the heavier a terrestrial
quadruped, the greater the strain on its bones (Ross, 1984; Lanyon, 1992). Therefore, the shape of the
limb bones in terrestrial quadrupeds is necessarily highly related to body mass and locomotor con-
straints (Hildebrand, 1974; Polly, 2007; Biewener & Patek, 2018).

On the concept of graviportality
Repeated modifications of the body plan and of the musculoskeletal system related to an increase in
body mass among mammalian quadrupeds have been studied and described by authors for more than
a century. These observations led them to characterize tall and heavy mammals as “graviportal” (Hil-
debrand, 1974; Polly, 2007). However, as obvious and intuitive as it may seem, the concept of “gravi-
portality” proved to be difficult to define precisely and objectively. This term was first introduced a
century ago by Gregory (1912), based on an idea of Osborn (1900). The very first definition of gravi-
portality was broad and mainly based on limb segment proportions, graviportal taxa being defined as
“heavy-bodied animals with long proximal and short distal limb segments” (Gregory, 1912) (Figure 1).
Although the term “animal” was quite unprecise, Gregory and Osborn only considered mammals in
their framework. Together with limb ratios, other anatomical and locomotor criteria were also involved
in this definition: body mass of several hundreds of kilograms, straightened vertical limbs (i.e. colum-
nar), large and strong bones, large feet with enlarged adipose cushions, reduced phalanges, long
strides associated with the inability to gallop. The archetypal group fulfilling all these criteria – and on
which the definition was mainly constructed – is proboscideans, and particularly modern elephants.

Gregory considered graviportality as opposed to “cursoriality”, which characterizes lightly-build mam-
malian quadrupeds with long and thin limbs associated with the ability to run or gallop, a category of
which horses and many ungulates are the most emblematic representatives. Gregory used a functional
and biomechanical approach to discriminate the limb bones of cursorial and graviportal taxa, elabo-
rating his definition both on the general construction of the limbs and on the shape of its components,
i.e. long bones and metapodials. Using different ratios between limb segments, Gregory sharpened his
classification introducing two intermediate categories named “mediportal” and “subcursorial”, de-
fined a posteriori following the different ranges of ratio he obtained rather than on precise anatomical
features. A subcursorial mammal should be understood as possessing moderate cursorial adaptations

with good running performances (e.g. felids and canids), whereas mediportal animals show confor-
mations meeting both the heavy weight bearing aspect and running capacities (e.g. suids, tapirs). Os-
born (1929) further developed these locomotor categories in his monography on American bronto-
therids, using this morphofunctional and anatomical framework to make locomotor inferences, not
only on these heavy Eocene-Oligocene perissodactyls but also on various other quadrupeds.

                                   portal taxa (B, Mastodon). After Osborn (1929), p. 734.

However, these pioneer works, despite their huge impact on subsequent morphofunctional consider-
ations, were based on a reduced taxonomic diversity among mammals and mixed heterogeneous con-
siderations to define these categories. Graviportality – and, similarly, cursoriality – was defined simul-
taneously on body proportions, limb construction, body weight, gait and some additional anatomical
features. If some archetypal animals like elephants and horses obviously fall in one of these categories,
most mammalian quadrupeds challenge this classification by displaying only part of the features asso-
ciated with each category.

Despite some limits, these locomotor categories have largely been used in anatomical, functional and
morphological works on mammalian quadrupeds, with few criticisms or attempts to clarify their defi-
nition and their bounds. Maynard Smith and Savage (1956) refined this framework by considering only
two main criteria to explain the variation observed in mammalian skeletons: the mechanical advantage
of a muscle (i.e. the lever arm on which it attaches) and the gait of an animal. This apparent

                                 Chapter 1 – Introduction and objectives


simplification led to terminological changes, like with the category “semi-graviportal”, in which were
placed groups previously considered as mediportals (like tapirs). Later, Hildebrand (1974) introduced
an arbitrary body mass of 900 kg beyond which species should be considered graviportal, although
without justifying this threshold by any functional or anatomical criterion. This framework developed
on mammals was then transferred to the study of Dinosauria by Coombs (1978). Some dinosaurs, like
sauropods, display gigantic proportions unrivalled among terrestrial animals and, consequently, are
extreme examples of graviportality. Coombs therefore used cursorial and graviportal categories to
study Dinosauria, trying to classify these animals without really questioning the categories themselves
or their accuracy outside Mammalia.

More recently, Carrano (1999) tackled this problem and tried to rethink those categories to overcome
the differences between clades and the difficulty to precisely define intermediate conformations. He
therefore replaced the classic discrete categories by a multivariate continuum of locomotor habits,
ranging from graviportal to cursorial and based on bone and muscular insertion measurements (Figure
2). These measurements were chosen to be “biomechanically relevant” and performed on both mam-
mals and dinosaurs. However, given the high disparity in body construction between these clades, this
questions the pertinence of mixing such different groups. Measurements were restricted to hind limb
elements, which display a very different organisation and role between mammals and dinosaurs. They
do not support the same proportion of the global mass and the presence of a long tail in most Dino-
sauria involves major architectural changes in the appendicular skeleton (Henderson, 2006). This ap-
proach, despite its novelty and originality, did not manage to bring a conclusive answer to the concept
of graviportality and its definition. One of the most recent progresses relative to this aspect has been
brought by Goussard (2009) in his unpublished study of the autopodium of sauropodomorphs. Gous-
sard proposed a new definition of graviportality based on three criteria: 1) columnar limbs (i.e. sensu
Osborn) with mandatory quadrupedy; 2) a reduction of the distal segments of the limbs relatively to
the proximal ones; 3) a deep modification of the morphology of the anterior and/or posterior autopo-
dium relatively to the plesiomorphic condition of the considered group (Goussard, 2009). This en-
hanced definition, developed mainly on the observation of Sauropodomorpha, may, however, be sub-
ject to exceptions when applied to other clades not directly related to Dinosauria.

                        are considered here as "graviportal" or “cursorial”. After Carrano (1999), p. 33.

Consequently, classic discrete locomotor categories remain largely used nowadays in their most “intu-
itive” way to decipher broad differences between clades along a graviportality-cursoriality gradient,
but without really questioning their definition (e.g. Alexander & Pond, 1992; Stein & Casinos, 1997;
Becker, 2003; Polly, 2007; Becker et al., 2009; Scherler et al., 2013; Hogervorst & Vereecke, 2014;
Houssaye et al., 2016; Stilson, Hopkins & Davis, 2016; Houssaye, Fernandez & Billet, 2016; MacLaren
& Nauwelaerts, 2016). More surprisingly, some authors transferred these concepts developed on
quadrupeds to the field of anthropology, leading them to consider humans as possessing a graviportal
hind limb (Bechtol, 1992): a relevant classification given the general architecture of the human body,
but quite unusual and counterintuitive in the classic framework of Gregory and Osborn. All of these

observations demonstrate the difficulty of giving graviportality a precise definition that could be used
broadly on any taxon.

Convergence towards high body mass: the “Cope-Depéret’s rule”
In addition to discussions about the concept of graviportality, the tendency among many amniote lin-
eages to exhibit an increase in body size through time has been largely documented and studied. This
multiple evolutionary convergence towards high body size is often referred to as the “Cope’s rule”,
despite the fact that no clearly formulated rule was present in the work of Cope (1887) (Stanley, 1973;
Polly, 1998). Actually, Depéret (1907) was the first, a few decades later, to clearly formalize this distinct
trend using both his own observations and the works of Cope – leading some authors to rather talk of
“Cope-Depéret” or “Depéret’s rule” (Bokma et al., 2016). From there, many experimental works
showed that, despite some exceptions (Gotanda et al., 2015), this tendency can indeed be observed
among many groups of amniotes (Laurin, 2004), particularly in mammals (e.g. Stanley, 1973; Alroy,
1998; Finarelli, 2007; Raia et al., 2012; Baker et al., 2015; Bokma et al., 2016). Despite many robust
examples of this evolutionary pattern, no consensus currently exists concerning the evolutionary
mechanisms sustaining it. Some authors have considered this trend as the result of individual varia-
tions actively driving the evolution of a whole lineage towards a high body size (Kingsolver & Pfennig,
2004), whereas others have suggested that this trend was more passively constrained (McShea, 1994),
notably through ecological specialization (Raia et al., 2012). At a smaller scale, it is likely that an in-
crease of body size is linked to differences in developmental rates (i.e. developmental heterochrony)
although these processes have not been extensively investigated, especially in mammals (McKinney,
1986; McKinney & McNamara, 1991; Hone & Benton, 2005; McNamara, 2012).

Different tetrapod lineages display a convergent trend towards high body mass. The most famous ex-
amples can be found among Dinosauria, with giant sauropods being considered as the heaviest terres-
trial animals that ever existed, as well as among mammal lineages, such as in Proboscidea, some Arti-
odactyla and Canidae, and in Perissodactyla (Stanley, 1973; Alroy, 1998; Finarelli, 2007; Raia et al.,
2012).

Perissodactyla
The order Perissodactyla appears as one of the numerous mammal groups containing some taxa that
were considered as graviportal (Osborn, 1929; Guérin, 1989; Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Alexander &
Pond, 1992). This clade was created by Owen (1848) grouping together hoofed mammals possessing
an odd number of digits. This observation was completed later by Marsh (1884) who observed that the
symmetry axis of the Perissodactyla autopodium coincides with the central digit (III), a condition now
viewed as plesiomorphic among Mammalia (Antoine, 2002). Marsh proposed to use the term

“Mesaxonia” to define this order, which is now considered as a synonym of Perissodactyla. The first
undisputed representatives of this order appeared around 56 Ma around the Paleocene-Eocene tran-
sition in the northern hemisphere (Gingerich, 2006).

Although the phylogenetic relations within the order have been highly debated for a century and still
remain non-consensual (Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Antoine, 2002; Holbrook & Lapergola, 2011), par-
ticularly for early taxa (Bronnert, 2018; Bai, Wang & Meng, 2018), five superfamilies are generally rec-
ognized as belonging to Perissodactyla: three with living representatives (Rhinocerotoidea, Tapiroidea,
Equoidea) and two extinct groups (Brontotherioidea, Chalicotherioidea) (Figure 3). Reaching a maximal
diversity from the Eocene to the Miocene, perissodactyls have gradually declined since then and were
frequently replaced by artiodactyls in many ecological niches (Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Antoine,
2002). They are represented nowadays by less than twenty species (4 or 5 tapirs, 6 or 7 equids and 5
rhinoceroses) (Dinerstein, 2011; MacLaren & Nauwelaerts, 2016; Bronnert, 2018).

Rhinocerotoidea
Among these superfamilies, Rhinocerotoidea is by far the one displaying the highest diversity of body
size and shape throughout its evolutionary history. Even if only five species of modern rhinos have
survived until today (Dinerstein, 2011), the superfamily was flourishing all along the Cenozoic. A rich
and well-preserved fossil record led palaeontologists to describe more than a hundred species distrib-
uted in Eurasia, North America and Africa, showing a large diversity of ecological niches, body size and
locomotor conditions (Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Cerdeño, 1998; Prothero, 2005; Biasatti, Wang &
Deng, 2018). In addition to many cases of convergence or parallelism towards high body size, several
transitions from a tetradactyl plesiomorphic (i.e. possessing a functional fifth metacarpal – (Antoine,
2002) manus as in tapirs to a tridactyl one similar to modern rhinos can be observed in several lineages
(Guérin, 1989; Prothero & Schoch, 1989).

Numerous taxonomic mistakes and reattributions for more than a century, associated with frequent
discoveries of new taxa, make it hard to provide an exhaustive inventory of all species and even genera
of Rhinocerotoidea. Moreover, like for Perissodactyla, no consensual phylogeny exists to date for the
entire group. Three main families are traditionally included within Rhinocerotoidea: Amynodontidae,
Hyracodontidae and Rhinocerotidae (Prothero, Manning & Hanson, 1986; Prothero & Schoch, 1989),
but recent works argue for the inclusion of the family Hyrachyidae within the superfamily and the split
of the family Hyracodontidae, considered as paraphyletic (Wang et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2017; Tissier et
al., 2018) (Figure 4).

           Hyrachyidae
The most ancient representative of the superfamily is the genus Hyrachyus. Frequently used as an
outgroup relatively to Rhinocerotoidea in anatomical and phylogenetic works, its inclusion in the su-
perfamily has been strongly debated for decades (Cope, 1873; Wood, 1934; Radinsky, 1966, 1967a;
Prothero, Manning & Hanson, 1986; Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Cerdeño, 1995; Holbrook, 1999, 2001;
Wang et al., 2016; Bai et al., 2017). Recent osteological investigation and comparison with related taxa
tend to confirm that the family Hyrachyidae (composed of the single genus Hyrachyus) should be con-
sidered as belonging to Rhinocerotoidea (Bai et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). Known from the Early to
the Middle Eocene in North America and Eurasia, Hyrachyus species did not exceed 100 kg and less
than one meter in height at the shoulder (Damuth & MacFadden, 1990; Stilson, Hopkins & Davis, 2016)
(Figure 4). These lightly-build animals where hornless browsers with generalized teeth (Carlson & Park,
2017). Despite a plesiomorphic tetradactyl manus, their “cursorial” appendicular skeleton suggests
that characters associated with a running lifestyle where present early among Rhinocerotoidea (Bai et
al., 2017) (Figure 5).

          Amynodontidae
Amynodontidae were a group of hornless rhinocerotoids living in North America and Eurasia from the
early Eocene to the end of the Oligocene (Wall, 1998; Averianov et al., 2017). If their position within
the phylogeny of Rhinocerotoidea remains debated, their monophyly is, nonetheless, largely accepted
(Wall, 1998; Tissier et al., 2018). About twelve genera are currently described, most of them being
monospecific (Wall, 1998; Averianov et al., 2017; Tissier et al., 2018). These relatively heavy tetradactyl
animals weighted from 120 kg to more than 2 tons for some species (Averianov et al., 2017) and pos-
sessed distinctive enlarged upper and lower canines possibly associated with sexual dimorphism, a
unique trait among Rhinocerotoidea (Wall, 1998). On some species, large nasal openings have been
interpreted as potentially linked to the presence of a proboscis as in tapirs (Tissier et al., 2018). Alt-
hough many species are only known from cranial and dental remains, postcranial characters of Amyno-
dontidae indicate a body construction close to that of tapirs and qualified as “mediportal” (Wall, 1998)
or “semi-graviportal” (Colbert, 1938). Largest species like Metamynodon have been considered as
graviportal (Osborn, 1929) (Figure 5). Sometimes considered as semi-aquatic in the literature, mainly
because of their discovery in sandstones formed in ancient river channels, morphofunctional investi-
gations proved that only some taxa like Paramynodon or Metamynodon actually showed characters
potentially related to an amphibious lifestyle similar to that of modern hippos (e.g. high orbits on the
skull, low thoracic spine, strongly developed olecranon process) (Wall & Heinbaugh, 1999). Except for
these cases, most of the other genera known in North America and Eurasia are considered as fully
terrestrial browsers (Wall, 1998).

          “Hyracodontidae”
The family Hyracodontidae has long been considered monophyletic, based on cranio-dental characters
and the “cursorial” aspect of its representatives due to their elongated limbs. In this group were
brought together ones of the smallest and biggest species of the superfamily, some of them being
moreover among the largest terrestrial mammals that ever existed (Prothero, 1998a). However, recent
advances in the study of this clade strongly support its paraphyly, underlining the need to split the
group in at least three distinct families: Hyracodontidae sensu stricto, Eggysodontidae and Paracera-
theriidae (Wang et al., 2016, 2018; Tissier et al., 2018) (Figure 4). The first family, Hyracodontidae
sensu stricto, is known from the middle Eocene to the end of the early Oligocene in North America and
Eurasia. Hyracodontids (sensu stricto) were small “cursorial” and hornless animals possessing a derived
tridactyl manus (Prothero, 1998a). Less than ten genera (most of them being monospecific) are cur-
rently included in Hyracodontidae sensu stricto (Wang et al., 2016, 2018). Some of them, like the genus
Triplopus, were even smaller with a more derived “cursorial” condition than Hyrachyus (Bai et al.,
2017) (Figure 5).

Members of the family Eggysodontidae (mostly defined on cranial and dental characters) are very
similar to Hyracodontidae and are also one of the poorest known representatives of Rhinocerotoidea,
with only four genera described to date, uncertain phylogenetic relationships and a very limited fossil
record (no Eggysodontidae are included in the present study as postcranial remains are very scarce for

this group) (Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Qiu & Wang, 1999; Bai & Wang, 2012; Wang et al., 2013, 2018).
Eggysodontidae are known from the late Eocene to the end of the Oligocene and considered as less
“cursorial” than Hyracodontidae (Prothero & Schoch, 1989).

Finally, members of the family Paraceratheriidae were thought to derive from small early hyracodon-
tids (Prothero, 1998a) until recent fossil discoveries and new phylogenetic investigations on cranio-
dental and postcranial characters showed that this group is monophyletic and not nested within Hyra-
codontidae sensu stricto (Wang et al., 2016, 2018) (Figure 4). If early diverging Paraceratheriidae from
the early Eocene were small animals similar to Hyracodontidae sensu stricto (like the genera Pappac-
eras or Forstercooperia), later diverging paraceratheriids showed a strong increase in body size until
the group’s extinction at the end of the Oligocene (Qiu & Wang, 2007; Prothero, 2013). Among them,
Paraceratherium is supposed to have measured 5 or 6 m at the shoulder for a body weight exceeding
10 tons, making it one of the largest land mammals that ever existed, only exceeded by some probos-
cideans (Fortelius & Kappelman, 1993; Larramendi, 2016) (Figure 5). Deep taxonomic uncertainties
have affected this family for more than a century (Prothero, 2013) but to date, about ten paracera-
theriid genera are generally recognized in North America and Asia (Qiu & Wang, 2007). These giant
hornless browsers are remarkable for being extremely tall and retaining a “cursorial” general construc-
tion with long slender limbs and no reduction of the autopodium relative length (Prothero, 1998a,
2013). Their discovery at the beginning of the 20th century thus challenged the initial concept of gravi-
portality as framed by Gregory and Osborn (Granger & Gregory, 1936; Prothero, 2013).

         Rhinocerotidae
This family appeared during the late Eocene (Prothero & Schoch, 1989) and is the only one with extant
representatives. It is by far the most diverse and best-known family among all Rhinocerotoidea, docu-
mented by a huge fossil record in North America, Eurasia and Africa (some species being known from
thousands of individuals – (Prothero, 2005). For two centuries, palaeontologists have described more
than 40 genera and 140 species showing an impressive diversity of size, weight, shape and ecology
(Cerdeño, 1998). This results in complex and still debated systematics from subfamilies to subtribes
(Antoine, 2002). To date, despite the existence of many phylogenetic reconstructions involving dozens
of species, no consensual phylogeny of the whole family is available (Cerdeño, 1995; Antoine, 2002;
Antoine, Duranthon & Welcomme, 2003; Piras et al., 2010; Antoine et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2011;
Becker, Antoine & Maridet, 2013; Lu, 2013; Tissier, Antoine & Becker, 2020) (Figure 4).

Different cases of morphological convergence or parallelism can be observed within this family. Many
lineages show an obvious increase of body size and body mass across the Cenozoic, with many late
diverging species reaching a weight of several tons (e.g., Elasmotherium in Elasmotheriinae, Aphelops

in Aceratheriini, Brachypotherium in Teleoceratina, Ceratotherium or Rhinoceros in Rhinocerotina)
(Guérin, 1989; Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Damuth & MacFadden, 1990; Dinerstein, 2011; Stilson, Hop-
kins & Davis, 2016). The development of nasal and/or frontal horns, often associated with a relatively
heavy head, occurred both among the subfamilies Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae, despite some
members of the latter group remaining hornless (e.g., most members of the tribe Aceratherinii)
(Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Prothero, 1998b; Antoine, 2002). The transition from a tetra- to a tridactyl
manus also occurred at least two times independently within Rhinocerotinae (among early genera like
Pleuroceros and later among the subtribe Teleoceratina in genera like Teleoceras) and maybe a third
time before the radiation of Elasmotheriinae (all being tridactyl – Antoine, 2002) (Figure 4). Another
repeated specialization is the shortening of the limbs leading to a strong brachypody (see below),
which reached a maximum among Teleoceratina but also in some Aceratherinii like Chilotherium
(Guérin, 1989; Cerdeño, 1998). Brachypody also occurred in dwarf species, with cases reported among
North American Aceratherinii and Teleoceratina (Prothero & Manning, 1987; Prothero, 2005). Con-
cerning feeding habits, the transition from browsing to grazing, associated with more hypsodont teeth,
occurred in several lineages, notably among Teleoceratina and Rhinocerotina, the extant genus Cera-
totherium being the only grazing modern species (Dinerstein, 2011). This grazer specialization reached
a maximum among Elasmotheriinae with the genus Elasmotherium, displaying hypselodonty as ob-
served in horses, and probably associated with the consumption of abrasive grasses in open steppes
(Guérin, 1989; Antoine, 2002).

After the Miocene, the ecologically successful and well-spread family Rhinocerotidae began to decline
in diversity and geographic range throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, likely due to deep climatic
changes and their replacement in many ecological niches by artiodactyls (Cerdeño, 1998; Antoine,
2002). Nowadays, only five species of modern rhinoceros survive on Earth: the White Rhinoceros (Cera-
totherium simum (Burchell, 1817)) and the Black Rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis (Linnaeus, 1758)) both
live in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas the Indian Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis Linnaeus, 1758), the
Javan Rhinoceros (R. sondaicus Desmarest, 1822) and the Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus suma-
trensis (Fischer, 1814)) survive in India and Nepal, Java, and Sumatra, respectively (Dinerstein, 2011).
Recently, it has been hypothesized that the two subspecies of white rhinoceros should be spited in
two distinct species, distinguishing the Northern white rhinoceros (C. cottoni) from the Southern white
rhinoceros (C. simum) (Groves, Fernando & Robovský, 2010). However, this taxonomic reattribution is
not consensual (Welker et al., 2015; Harley et al., 2016) and will not be considered in the present study.

Moreover, the phylogenetic relationships between the modern species remain highly debated and
non-consensual, whether they are based on morphology, mitochondrial or nuclear DNA or RNA, pro-
teomic data or even the combination of different data sets through meta-analyses. Four different

patterns are frequently hypothesized in the literature (Figure 6): 1) D. sumatrensis being the sister-
taxon of both African and Asiatic clades (Fernando et al., 2006; Piras et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2014;
Harley et al., 2016); 2) D. sumatrensis being the sister-taxon of the African clade (Morales & Melnick,
1994; Antoine, 2002; Antoine, Duranthon & Welcomme, 2003; Antoine et al., 2010; Steiner & Ryder,
2011; Becker, Antoine & Maridet, 2013; Lu, 2013; Gaudry, 2017; Cappellini et al., 2019); 3) D. suma-
trensis being the sister-taxon of the Asiatic clade (Prothero, Manning & Hanson, 1986; Cerdeño, 1995;
Tougard et al., 2001; Orlando et al., 2003; Price & Bininda‐Emonds, 2009; Deng et al., 2011; Yuan et
al., 2014; Gaudry, 2017; Welker et al., 2017; Zein et al., 2019); 4) a hard polytomy at the base of the
crown-group containing the five modern species (Willerslev et al., 2009; Gaudry, 2017). The deep dif-
ferences in phylogenetic reconstructions could indicate a short divergence time (over about 1 Ma)
between the three modern branches (Willerslev et al., 2009). Given these observations and in the ab-
sence of consensus, I will consider a polytomy between the three main groups of modern rhinos (Figure
6D). More details concerning the five modern species will be given in Chapter 3.

Graviportality and gracility among Rhinocerotoidea
Given the biological diversity and the repeated size and mass increases encountered within the super-
family Rhinocerotoidea, its members have been classically sorted using the locomotor categories in-
troduced by Gregory (1912) and Osborn (1929) (see above). However, many works tended to use only
ratios between limb segments, with little consideration of other morphofunctional criteria like gait or
body mass (e.g. Granger & Gregory, 1936; Colbert, 1938; Arambourg, 1959; Guérin, 1980; Eisenmann

                                                              42


                                 Chapter 1 – Introduction and objectives


& Guérin, 1984). This simplification of the framework of Gregory and Osborn is likely related to the
fact that many Rhinocerotoidea representatives show remarkable variations in the relative proportions
of their limb segments. This is particularly visible in Paraceratheriidae (see above) but also among the
subtribe Teleoceratina displaying extremely short limbs (Prothero, 2005; Becker et al., 2009).

The focus on limb segment proportions led authors to consider the degree of gracility (or, at the op-
posite, robusticity) to categorize rhino species, sometimes using a single “gracility index” computed
on third metapodials. This index is classically computed by dividing the metapodial transversal width
by the total length (e.g. Colbert, 1938; Arambourg, 1959; Cerdeño & Alcalá, 1989; Cerdeño, 1998;
Becker, 2003; Becker et al., 2009; Scherler et al., 2013). Like for “graviportality”, “gracility” and
“rubosticity” appear to be intuitive terms but can refer to many different confusing concepts. Lahr &
Wright (1996) defined “robust” as “something ‘strongly formed or constructed’”, suggesting that “grac-
ile” might be the opposite – something lightly formed or constructed. When talking about the general
proportions of an animal, these terms may relate to its overall size and/or mass relatively to other
species or clades (e.g. a horse will be considered as robust compared to an antelope, but as gracile
compared to an elephant). They may also relate more specifically to anatomical parts, as some limb
bones can be considered more robust than others when showing a larger shaft for a given length,
conferring again to this term a relative value only. That is why some authors preferred the term
“brachypody” to talk about the condition of some rhinos, which are both short-legged and showing
limb bones with a relatively larger shaft. However, even if it has been used for more than a century
(Osborn, 1902), this term is not systematically employed in rhino studies (e.g. Osborn, 1929; Guérin,
1989; Cerdeño, 1993, 1998; Becker, 2003; Ménouret & Guérin, 2009; Becker et al., 2009; Antoine et
al., 2018). Furthermore, its contrary (“dolichopody”, referring to long-legged and slender animals) has
almost never been used in rhino studies (Osborn, 1902).

Finally, graviportality has sometimes been confused with brachypody in rhinos, as the reduction of the
distal limb elements is one of the criteria associated with the classic framework of Gregory and Osborn,
but is not considered as exclusive to define the locomotor category of a quadruped. Consequently,
some rhino species might have been exaggeratedly qualified as “graviportal” based on limb element
proportions only (e.g. Maynard Smith & Savage, 1956; Prothero & Sereno, 1982; Eisenmann & Guérin,
1984; Becker, 2003; Becker et al., 2009).

Objectives
The superfamily Rhinocerotoidea features prominently among the different clades of quadrupedal am-
niotes affected by repeated increases in size through their evolutionary history. It therefore appears
as a relevant group to study relations between body mass and limb bone shape, and how a same body

mass can be associated with different body shapes. The great diversity in body size and body shape
within this superfamily led to confusing uses of concepts like graviportality and brachypody, these con-
cepts themselves having some limits. Moreover, investigations regarding the limbs of rhinos until to-
day mainly focused on the ratios between the different segments. Morphological changes of the limb
bones were mostly investigated for systematic and palaeoenvironmental purposes but rarely to ad-
dress the morphofunctional links between the body size, body mass and degree of brachypody with
shape variation.

The main objective of the present study is therefore to explore the shape variation of the limb long
bones among Rhinocerotoidea relatively to body mass and body proportions along their evolution-
ary history in order to better understand how the skeleton modifies to meet the functional require-
ments of a coordinated locomotion and the support of a heavy weight. This study will focus on the
elements composing the stylopodium and zeugopodium, since their shape is considered as highly in-
fluenced by variations of body proportions (Biewener, 1983; Anderson, Hall-Martin & Russell, 1985;
Damuth & MacFadden, 1990; Bertram & Biewener, 1992; Campione & Evans, 2012). Girdle elements
often appear poorly correlated with shape variation of the other limb elements and variations of body
mass in mammalian quadrupeds. Conversely, the shape of autopodium elements is known to be re-
lated to ecological factors in addition to body mass (Christiansen, 2002; Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Sears,
Capellini & Diogo, 2015; Hanot et al., 2017). For these reasons and given the time constraints to realize
this study, they will not be considered in this study. Considerations about the material and the general
methodology used in this study are given in Chapter 2.

Understanding the variation in modern representatives of a group is often a very insightful step before
studying fossil specimens. Shape variation of the appendicular skeleton of modern rhinos and its rela-
tions with body mass have been poorly explored in anatomical works until now. The five modern spe-
cies of rhinoceros display a broad range of size and mass. The exploration of their shape diversity taking
into account their phylogenetic relationships should shed light on the relations between limb morphol-
ogy and body mass. Moreover, exploring the shape patterns among extant species, while accounting
for their intraspecific variation, will allow a preliminary approach to the correspondence between bone
shape and phylogeny. This morphofunctional study in modern rhinos is presented in Chapter 3.

Considering the shape variation of each bone individually should bring elements to explore the con-
struction of the limbs relatively to body mass in a global way. As limb bones form a coherent system
in themselves and are linked with muscles, tendons and ligaments, their respective shapes are likely
to covary under functional constraints like weight support. Fore and hind limbs being constructed with
serially homologous elements (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005), bones are also shaped by shared

developmental processes within and between limbs (Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall, 2002; Bininda-
Emonds et al., 2007). Consequently, the shape of the various segments of the appendicular skeleton,
and particularly the long bones (Schmidt & Fischer, 2009; Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Hanot et al., 2017;
Botton-Divet et al., 2018), tend to highly covary with each other among quadruped mammals, a phe-
nomenon called morphological integration (Klingenberg, 2008, 2014; Schmidt & Fischer, 2009). The
support of a heavy mass is likely to influence the degree of integration of limb bones, as their shape is
submitted to a common stress due to load bearing (Hildebrand, 1974; Biewener, 1983, 1989b). How-
ever, the influence of functional constraints, like variation in body mass, on the integration of limb
bones has rarely been tested, and almost never on heavy taxa like rhinos. The Chapter 4 will therefore
explore how the shape of the long bones covary among modern rhinos, and how could body mass
influence these patterns of morphological integration.

The exploration of morphological variation and covariation of limb bones in modern rhinos will allow
a better understanding of the relations between bone shape and body mass. However, modern rhinos
only represent a small and relatively homogeneous sample compared to the past diversity and re-
peated increases in body size among Rhinocerotoidea. Consequently, the extension of this exploration
to the whole superfamily will give access to a higher diversity of body proportions, allowing to shed
light on broader patterns of shape variation of long bones. This approach will allow to understand how
long bones are influenced by body size, mass, the degree of brachypody and the evolutionary history.
The morphological richness of this group will allow to highlight similarities and differences in the pat-
terns of shape variation for each limb bone, but also between the bones, between the limbs and be-
tween the different clades. Chapters 5 and 6 address these questions on forelimb and hind limb bones,
respectively.

Finally, this global view of the shape variation among Rhinocerotoidea should bring the necessary ele-
ments to precisely highlight if body mass plays a role in shaping long bones and, if so, how it does in
multiple ways under the constraint of evolutionary legacy. This large exploration should help to shed
light on the common patterns of shape variation related to body mass across the superfamily. At a
broader scale, similarities and differences between bones, between limbs and between clades within
Rhinocerotoidea will help to discuss the relevance of the concept of graviportality in this group, its
relation with the degree of brachypody and the contribution of shape analysis to its definition. These
elements are discussed in Chapter 7.

Material
This investigation focuses on the six bones composing the stylopodium and the zeugopodium of both
fore and hind limb: humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, fibula. All anatomic terms and morphological
descriptions used along this study will be given in Chapter 3 concerning the shape variation of modern
rhinos. Specimens of modern and fossil rhinos were gathered in 21 institutions across the world (12
that I visited myself, 3 visited by A. Houssaye and 6 that directly provided me 3D models). A total of
almost 500 bones of modern rhinos and around 1,675 bones of fossil rhinos were selected during field
missions. Non-suitable specimens (immature, deformed or broken specimens) were discarded after-
ward from analyses. Details regarding the specimens used in each analysis are given in their respective
chapters.

General methodology
The analysis of shape variation has been performed using 3D geometric morphometrics, a widely used
approach allowing quantification of morphological differences between objects using landmark coor-
dinates (Adams, Rohlf & Slice, 2004; Zelditch et al., 2012).

            3D models
Bones were mostly digitized with a structured-light three-dimensional scanner (Artec Eva) and recon-
structed with Artec Studio Professional software (v12.1.1.12 – Artec 3D, 2018). Complementarily, some
bones were digitized with a photogrammetric approach, following Mallison & Wings (2014) and Fau,
Cornette & Houssaye (2016). Sets of photos were taken all around the bones and aligned to reconstruct
a 3D model with Agisoft Photoscan software (v1.4.2 – Agisoft, 2018). Previous studies indicated no
significant difference between 3D models obtained with these two methods (Petti et al., 2008; Remon-
dino et al., 2010; Fau, Cornette & Houssaye, 2016). Some bones were digitized using medical computed
tomography scanners at the Royal Veterinary College, London (Equine Hospital) and at the University
of California, San Francisco (Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging) and provided by Pr. J.
Hutchinson. Bone surfaces were extracted as meshes using Avizo software (v9.5.0 – Thermo Fisher
Scientific, 2018). Each mesh was decimated to reach 250,000 vertices and 500,000 faces using
MeshLab software (v2016.12 - Cignoni et al., 2008). I mainly selected left bones during acquisition;
when this was impossible, right bones were selected and then mirrored before analysis.

            Landmark digitization
Following the procedure described by Gunz, Mitteroecker & Bookstein (2005), Gunz & Mitteroecker
(2013) and Botton-Divet et al. (2016), I defined the bones’ shape using anatomical landmarks and curve
and surface sliding semi-landmarks. Each curve is bordered by anatomical landmarks as recommended

                               Chapter 2 – Material and general methodology


by Gunz & Mitteroecker (2013). All landmarks and curves were placed using the IDAV Landmark soft-
ware (v3.0 – Wiley et al., 2005). Number and position of landmarks slightly varied depending on the
objectives of each chapter. Specific details on landmarks are therefore given in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Following the procedure detailed by Botton-Divet et al. (2016), I created a template to place surface
semi-landmarks for each bone: a specimen was chosen on which all anatomical landmarks, curve and
surface sliding semi-landmarks were placed. As for landmarks, the choice of this specimen is different
depending on the performed analyses. Details are provided in the respective chapters. The template
was then used for the projection of surface sliding semi-landmarks on the surface of the other speci-
mens. Projection was followed by a relaxation step to ensure that projected points matched the actual
surface of the meshes. Curve and surface sliding semi-landmarks were then slid to minimize the bend-
ing energy of a Thin Plate Spline between each specimen and the template at first, and then two times
between the result of the preceding step and the Procrustes consensus of the complete dataset. There-
fore, all landmarks can be treated at the end as geometrically homologous (Gunz, Mitteroecker &
Bookstein, 2005) and analysed with classic procedure such as Generalized Procrustes Analysis (see be-
low). Projection, relaxation and sliding processes were conducted using the Morpho package in the R
environment (R Core Team, 2014). Details of the process are provided in the documentation of the
package (Schlager, 2018).

         Generalized Procrustes Analysis
After the sliding of all semi-landmarks, I performed Generalized Procrustes Analyses (GPA) (Gower,
1975; Rohlf & Slice, 1990) to remove the effects of size and of the relative position of the points and
to isolate only the shape information. As datasets contained more variables than observations, a Prin-
cipal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality as recommended by Gunz & Mit-
teroecker (2013) and visualize the specimen distribution in the morphospace. At the end of this step,
superimposed landmark coordinates were then used in subsequent analyses detailed in their respec-
tive chapters.

         Repeatability tests
For each bone, I tested the repeatability of the anatomical landmark digitization taking measurements
ten times on three specimens of the same species, Ceratotherium simum, chosen to display the closest
morphology and size. I superimposed these measurements using a GPA and visualized the results using
a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results showed a variation within specimens clearly smaller
than the variation between specimens (Figure 7) and allowed me to consider the anatomical landmarks
as precise enough to describe shape variation. Similar tests were performed with reduced landmark
datasets used in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 and showed similar results.

tween landmark digitization. I concluded to the relevance of the anatomical landmark configuration to describe shape vari-
                                                    ation within the sample.

Introduction 1
Among living terrestrial mammals, modern rhinos are generally considered as one of the three heaviest
taxa, together with elephants and hippos. All three are commonly considered as graviportal (Alexander
& Pond, 1992). However, given the difficulty to find a consensual definition of graviportality (see Chap-
ter 1), categorization of these three taxa may vary depending on authors. Elephants obviously fulfil all
the morphological and biomechanical criteria defining graviportality (Coombs, 1978; Langman et al.,
1995). However, the peculiar morphology of hippos (barrel-like body and shortened limbs) linked to
semi-aquatic habits has been considered alternately as mediportal (Coombs, 1978; Ross, 1984) or gra-
viportal (Alexander & Pond, 1992; Carrano, 1999; MacFadden, 2005; Stilson, Hopkins & Davis, 2016).
Rhino’s graviportal condition is surely the least consensual: Gregory (1912) and Osborn (1929) consid-
ered rhinos as mediportal whereas later works assigned them a graviportal condition (Prothero and
Sereno, 1982; Eisenmann and Guérin, 1984). Becker (2003) and Becker et al. (2009) dug into this ques-
tion and developed a “gracility index” based on the work of Guérin (1980) to categorize modern and
fossil rhinos, but only based on third metacarpal and metatarsal proportions. The use of this index
refined the classification of modern rhinos distinguishing mediportal and graviportal species instead
of a single class attribution for the whole family (Table 1).

Regardless of the locomotor type to which rhinos belong, the family Rhinocerotidae includes five spe-
cies that all display adaptations to support their high body mass (Alexander & Pond, 1992) (see Chapter
1): the White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), the Black Rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), the Indian
Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), the Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) and the Sumatran Rhi-
noceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) (Dinerstein, 2011). These species exhibit an important variation in
body mass and size (Table 1), ranging from less than a ton for Dicerorhinus sumatrensis to more than
three tons for the biggest known specimens of Ceratotherium simum. They are all good walkers and
runners, able to gallop and reach an elevated speed (27 km/h for Ceratotherium simum, Alexander &
Pond, 1992; 45 km/h for Diceros bicornis, Blanco, Gambini & Fariña, 2003). However, important eco-
logical differences also exist (Groves, 1967a,b, 1972; Groves & Kurt, 1972; Laurie, Lang & Groves, 1983;
Hillman-Smith & Groves, 1994; Dinerstein, 2011; Groves & Leslie, 2011): the three Asiatic rhinos are
excellent swimmers and very familiar with an aquatic environment whereas the two African ones are
easily stopped by a relatively deep river (Guérin, 1980). While Ceratotherium simum is a pure grazer,

Rhinoceros unicornis can both graze and browse small shrubs, leafy material and fruits, the three other
species being mainly leaf browsers. Before the drastic decrease of their natural habitats under human
pressure, rhinos occupied a wide geographic range across Africa and Asia (Dinerstein, 2011; Rook-
maaker & Antoine, 2012).

Despite the importance of rhino species for understanding evolution towards large body mass and the
fact that they are some of the heaviest surviving land mammals, only a few studies really explore the
variation of their limb bone morphology in relation to their body proportions (Guérin, 1980; Eisenmann
& Guérin, 1984). After the pioneering works of Cuvier (1812) and de Blainville & Nicard (1839) describ-
ing the postcranial anatomy of modern rhinos, almost no work tried to broadly analyse and compare
the morphology of their limb bones. Guérin (1980) published a substantial comparative anatomy work
on the whole skeleton of the five extant species. This study emphasized anatomical descriptions with
a direct application on the determination of fossil forms. Despite considerations on inter- and intra-
specific osteological variation in modern rhinos, this work did not fully explore the patterns of shape
variation in this group. Furthermore, most of the previous studies used a classic morphometric ap-
proach with linear measurements on bones, an approach which cannot precisely take into considera-
tion the whole shape of the bone in three dimensions (3D). To date, no morphofunctional analyses
have been carried out on limb long bones of modern rhinos taking into consideration their whole
shape.

In this chapter, I hypothesize that modern rhinoceroses exhibit a large amount of interspecific variation
of the shape of each bone that would be essentially associated with a strong effect of body mass on
bone morphology. I predict that this effect will be more pronounced on the stylopodium (humerus and
femur) than on the zeugopodium (radius, ulna, tibia and fibula) bones. This would be in accordance
with previous works on changes of limb shape between graviportal and cursorial taxa (Biewener,
1989b; Campione & Evans, 2012). In addition, I expect a potential effect of the phylogenetic heritage
and different species’ ecologies on bone shape. To test these hypotheses, I propose to explore the
variation in the shape of the limb long bones among the five modern rhino species using a 3D geomet-
ric morphometrics approach. I describe interspecific patterns of morphological variation for the six
bones composing the stylopodium and the zeugopodium, taking into account the intraspecific varia-
tion.

Material and Methods
          Sample
I selected 62 dry skeletons in different European museums belonging to the five extant rhino species:
C. simum, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, Diceros bicornis, R. sondaicus and R. unicornis (Table 2). I followed
the taxonomic attribution given by each institution for most of the specimens, except for three indi-
viduals determined or reattributed by myself on osteological criteria and later confirmed by the mor-
phometric analysis (see Table 2). I studied altogether 53 humeri, 49 radii, 46 ulnae, 56 femora, 52 tibiae
and 50 fibulae, with 37 skeletons being complete. I included only mature specimens with fully fused
epiphyses (adults) or specimens where the line of the epiphyseal plates was still visible on some bones
(subadults). Bones showing breakages or unnatural deformations were not considered in the analysis.
It has been proved that feet bones are subject to important osteopathologic deformations in rhinos
(Regnault et al., 2013). However, in accordance with the observations of Guérin (1980), I did not notice
any major difference between the long bones of captive and wild animals, neither through visual and
osteological observations nor in the morphometric analyses; I therefore did not take into account this
parameter. Sexual dimorphism occurs among rhinos but has been mostly investigated regarding the
external morphology of the animals (Dinerstein, 1991; Berger, 1994; Zschokke & Baur, 2002; Din-
erstein, 2011). The few studies that have explored the osteological variations between sexes indicated
only slight absolute metric divergences depending on species (Guérin, 1980; Groves, 1982). This sug-
gests that intraspecific variation due to sex may be marginal when compared to interspecific variation,
and probably more related to the size of the bone than to the shape. Furthermore, since almost half
of the sample lacked sex information and that I had twice as many males than females, I could not
carefully address sex in this study (see Results).

          Anatomical terminology
All anatomical terms used to describe bones come from classic references: the Nomina Anatomica
Veterinaria (World Association of Veterinary Anatomists & International Committee on Veterinary
Gross Anatomical Nomenclature, 2005) and anglicized terms of Barone (2010a) for general osteology
and bone orientation, Guérin (1980) for specific rhino anatomy, complemented by the contributions
of Colyn (1980), Antoine (2002) and Heissig (2012). Despite these previous works, one anatomical fea-
ture remained unnamed, leading me to use my own designation: I called “palmar process” the process
facing the coronoid process on the palmar border of the radius proximal epiphysis. Muscle insertions
were described after the general anatomy of horses (Barone, 2010b), complemented by the work of
Beddard & Treves (1889) and some complementary information from Guérin (1980) on rhino myology,
Bressou (1961) on that of tapirs and Fisher, Scott & Naples (2007) and Fisher, Scott & Adrian (2010) on
that of hippos.

    Table 2: List of the studied specimens with skeletal composition, sex, age class, condition and 3D acquisition details.
Bones—H, humerus; R, radius; U, ulna; Fe, femur; T, tibia; Fi, fibula. Sex: F, female; M, male; U, unknown. Age—A, adult; Sa,
  sub-adult. Condition—W, wild; C, captive; U, unknown. 3D acquisition—SS, surface scanner; P, photogrammetry; CT, CT-
 scan. Institutional codes as in Chapter 2. * Specimens NHMUK ZD 2018.143 and NHMUK ZD 1972.822 were determined by
ourselves during the visit of the collections on the basis of morphological observations and measurements on the post-cra-
nial elements. These determinations were later confirmed by the shape analysis. ** The specimen MNHN-ZM-AC-1885-734
was previously determined as Rhinoceros sondaicus based on a supposed Javan origin. The observations made on both long
 bones and tarsal elements led me to consider this individual as an Indian rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis). This attribution was
                                             later confirmed by the shape analysis.

           Geometric Morphometrics
I placed 35 anatomical landmarks on the humerus, 23 on the radius, 21 on the ulna, 27 on the femur,
24 on the tibia and 12 on the fibula. Details of landmark numbers and locations used for each bone are
given in Appendix 1 of this chapter. The specimen chosen as the template for projection, relax and
sliding steps was Ceratotherium simum RMCA 1985.32-M-0001. Projection, relax, sliding and GPA were
performed as described in Chapter 2.

As the dataset contained more variables than observations, I used a Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to reduce dimensionality as recommended by Gunz & Mitteroecker (2013) and visualize the
specimen distribution in the morphospace. I computed theoretical consensus shape of the sample and
used it to calculate a TPS deformation of the template mesh. I then used this newly created consensus
mesh to compute theoretical shapes associated with the maximum and minimum of both sides of each
PCA, as well as mean shapes of each bone for each species. GPA, PCA and shape computations were
done using the “Morpho” and “geomorph” packages (Adams & Otárola‐Castillo, 2013; Adams, Collyer
& Kaliontzopoulou, 2018; Schlager, 2018) in the R environment (R Core Team, 2014). Neighbour Joining
method was used to construct trees based on relative Euclidian distances between individuals based
on all principal component scores obtained with the PCA, allowing a global visualisation of the rela-
tionships between all the specimens. Trees were computed with the “ape” package (Paradis et al.,
2018).

           Allometry effect

In order to explore the relation between body mass and bone shape, I tested the effect of allometry,
defined as “the size-related changes of morphological traits” (Klingenberg, 2016). Pearson’s correla-
tion tests were performed to look for correlation between the principal components and the centroid
size (log10) for each bone. I also used the function procD.allometry of the “geomorph” package to per-
form a Procrustes ANOVA (a linear regression model using Procrustes distances between species in-

species determination on the shape variation. In the absence of individual body mass for the majority
of the sample, I also performed a Procrustes ANOVA with the cube root of the mean mass attributed
to each species (Table 1), each species being associated with the mean mass of its species. Like for the
centroid size, theoretical shapes associated with minimal and maximal mean mass were computed
using the predicted Procrustes residuals (details on the procedure are given in the “geomorph” docu-
mentation). Plots of the multivariate regressions of shape scores (i.e. regression of shape on size; see
Drake & Klingenberg, 2008) against log-transformed centroid size were also computed.

Results
          Shape analysis
I describe here the results of PCA for each bone and focus on the theoretical shape variations along
the two main axes. For each bone, I chose to represent relevant views and anatomical features. Com-
plete visualizations of the different theoretical shapes for the two first axes are available in Appendix
2 of this chapter. Analysis of shape relations among the sample is completed by the Neighbour Joining
trees provided in Appendix 3 of this chapter.

             Humerus

The first two axes of the PCA computed on the humerus represent 60.6% of the total variance (Figure
8A). The first axis represents more than half of the global variance (53%) and the five species appear
clearly sorted along it, opposing Ds. sumatrensis on the positive side to C. simum on the negative one,
i.e. the lightest and heaviest species, respectively. Dc. bicornis is grouped with C. simum on the nega-
tive part of the axis, whereas R. sondaicus is on the positive part. R. unicornis occupies the centre of
the axis, between Dc. bicornis and R. sondaicus. Points distribution in the morphospace and Neighbour
Joining trees indicate a clear separation between African and Asiatic rhinos (see Appendix 3A). The
theoretical shape at the PC1 minimum (Figure 8B, D, F, H) shows a massive morphology, with mediola-
terally and craniocaudally broad epiphyses and shaft; a wide humeral head, with very little overhanging
of the diaphysis in the caudal direction; a lesser tubercle more strongly developed than the greater
tubercle, with an intermediate tubercle separating a widely open bicipital groove into unequal parts,
the lateral one being the largest; a lesser tubercle convexity medially extended whereas the greater
tubercle one is quite reduced in this direction; a broad and diamond-shaped m. infraspinatus imprint
on the lateral side; a broad deltoid tuberosity not extending beyond the lateral border of the bone; a
shaft with its maximal width situated between the head neck and the deltoid tuberosity; a distinct but
very smooth and flat m. teres major tuberosity; a distal epiphysis very large because of the develop-
ment of the lateral epicondyle; a smooth epicondylar crest; a medial epicondyle mediolaterally wide
and craniocaudally compressed; shallow and proximodistally compressed olecranon fossa and troch-
lea, a wide trochlea displaying a main axis tilted in the dorsoventral direction; and a capitulum with a
relatively small surface area. At the opposite, the theoretical shape at the PC1 maximum (Figure 8C, E,
G, I) shows a slender and thin aspect; a more rounded humeral head overhanging caudally the diaph-
ysis; a greater tubercle more strongly developed than the lesser one and extending medially, confer-
ring a more closed aspect to the bicipital groove, where the intermediate tubercle is almost absent; a
slightly marked lesser tubercle convexity whereas the greater tubercle one is massive; a rounded and
reduced m. infraspinatus insertion; a deltoid tuberosity strongly protruding laterally; a straight and
thin shaft; no visible m. teres major tuberosity; a narrow distal epiphysis, with a small development of

the lateral epicondyle; a sharp epicondylar crest; a medial epicondyle craniocaudally developed and
overhanging the olecranon fossa; a deep and wide olecranon fossa; a far less compressed trochlea,
with an axis less dorsoventrally tilted; and a very reduced capitulum.

Along the second axis (7.6%), C. simum and Ds. sumatrensis are grouped together on the negative part
of the axis, with the three other species on the positive part, whereas they are opposed along the first
axis. This second axis expresses the separation between the lightest and the heaviest rhino species on
the one hand and the three other species on the other hand. The theoretical shape at the PC2 mini-
mum displays a humeral head stretched in the caudal direction; a lesser tubercle more developed than
the greater one, delimiting an open bicipital groove; a distal epiphysis proximodistally extended, with
an epicondylar crest starting almost on the middle of the shaft; a rounded and wide olecranon fossa.
At the opposite, the theoretical shape at the PC2 maximum shows a rounded humeral head; a strong
development of both tubercles and a more closed bicipital groove; a distal epiphysis mediolaterally
stretched, with the epicondylar crest starting at the distal third of the shaft; an olecranon fossa proxi-
modistally compressed and more rectangular; and a well-developed lateral epicondyle.

             Radius

The first two axes of the PCA performed on the radius express 52.3% of the total variance (Figure 9A).
The first axis (36.4%) opposes Ds. sumatrensis and Dc. bicornis to R. unicornis and C. simum. R. son-
daicus overlaps both R. unicornis and Dc. bicornis clusters. The specimens of Ds. sumatrensis are split
in two discrete clusters along the first axis, but no clear explanation linked to age, sex or geographic
origin was associated with this distribution. Point dispersion along this axis indicates an important in-
traspecific variation for Ds. sumatrensis, and to a lesser extent for Dc. bicornis and R. sondaicus. Unlike
for the humerus, phylogenetically related species are not grouped together on PCA and Neighbour
Joining trees (see Appendix 3B). The theoretical shape at the PC1 minimum (Figure 9B, D, F, H) shows
a massive morphology with large shaft and epiphyses; an asymmetrical proximal articular surface (con-
stituting the ulnar notch), with a medial portion appearing nearly twice as large as the lateral one; a
protruding lateral insertion relief (i.e. insertion area of the m. extensor digitorum) whereas the radial
tuberosity is little prominent; a lateral synovial articulation surface for the ulna mediolaterally reduced;
a rectangular and thin medial synovial articulation surface for the ulna; a triangular proximal articular
surface for the ulna as wide mediolaterally as proximodistally; a thick shaft with an interosseous space
opening close to the proximal epiphysis: consequently, the interosseous crest runs along the diaphysis
to the distal articular surface for the ulna; a broad distal epiphysis in the mediolateral direction, with
a strong medial tubercle developed on the dorsal face; a distal articular surface compressed in the
dorsoventral direction; an articular surface for the scaphoid little extended proximally; a trapezoidal
and wide articular surface for the semilunar (i.e. lunate bone or lunatum); a well-developed radial sty-

loid process. The theoretical shape at the PC1 maximum (Figure 9C, E, G, I) displays a more slender
morphology; a proximal articular surface less asymmetrical despite the development of the medial
part; an almost absent lateral insertion relief; a completely flat radial tuberosity; a lateral synovial ar-
ticulation for the ulna mediolaterally stretched; a rectangular and thin medial synovial articulation for
the ulna; a triangular proximal articular surface for the ulna, mediolaterally short and proximodistally
stretched; a thin and slender shaft, with an interosseous space opening at the proximal third of the
total length; a poorly visible interosseous crest; a distal epiphysis far less dorsoventrally compressed
and a lateral tubercle on the dorsal side poorly developed; a distal articular surface dorsoventrally wide
with the surface responding to the scaphoid extending proximally; a trapezoidal and reduced articular
surface for the semilunar; a less developed radial styloid process with a rounded border.

The second axis (15.9%) discriminates mainly R. sondaicus from the four other species. R. unicornis
displays little extension along this axis; neither does Dc. bicornis, only driven on the negative side by a
single individual. R. unicornis extension along the second axis is very limited, contrary to that of C.
simum and Ds. sumatrensis clusters. As on the first axis, Ds. sumatrensis is split in two clusters, one in
the negative part and the other around null values. The theoretical shape at the PC2 minimum displays
a slender morphology, with a strongly asymmetrical proximal articular surface; a palmar process op-
posed to the coronoid process proximally reduced; a distal epiphysis dorsoventrally broad, with a de-
veloped lateral prominence; a little developed radial styloid process; an articular surface for the scaph-
oid proximally extended. The theoretical shape at PC2 maximum displays a more massive shape; a
deeper and more symmetrical proximal articular surface with a well-developed palmar process; a dor-
soventrally compressed distal epiphysis with a more developed styloid process.

             Ulna

The first two axes of the PCA performed on the ulna express 41.5% of the total variance (Figure 10A).
The first axis (22.1%) separates Ds. sumatrensis and Dc. bicornis on the positive part and R. sondaicus,
R. unicornis and C. simum on the negative part. However, the clusters of C. simum and R. unicornis
overlap along this axis. The general pattern on both PCA and Neighbour Joining trees is close to the
one observed for the radius (see Appendix 3C). The theoretical shape at the PC1 minimum (Figure 10B,
D, F, H) displays a thick morphology with large epiphyses; a massive olecranon tuberosity with a medial
tubercle – where inserts the medial head of the m. triceps brachii – oriented dorsally; an anconeal
process poorly developed dorsally and mediolaterally wide, as is the articular surface constituting the
trochlear notch (receiving the humeral trochlea); a medially stretched medial part of the articular sur-
face for the humerus; a short interosseous crest ending at the shaft half, with the interosseous space;
a broad shaft with a triangular section; a straight palmar border whereas the shaft is medially curved;
a massive distal epiphysis with a wide insertion surface for the radius; an articular surface for the tri-

sponding to the pisiform is crescent-shaped and little extended proximally. The theoretical shape for
the PC1 maximum (Figure 10C, E, G, I) displays a more gracile morphology; a slender olecranon tuber-
osity with a medial tubercle where inserts the medial head of the m. triceps brachii oriented in the
palmar direction; an anconeal process dorsally developed and mediolaterally narrow, as is the articular
surface of the trochlear notch; a slightly medially stretched medial part of the articular surface; a sharp
interosseous crest; a thin and straight shaft; a distal epiphysis mediolaterally compressed and little
concave; an articular surface for the triquetrum mediolaterally narrow; a triangular and proximally
well-developed articular surface for the pisiform.

The second axis (19.4%) separates quite clearly the three Asian species from the African ones. The
theoretical shape at the PC2 minimum displays a slender and straight morphology with a high square-
shaped olecranon process, mediolaterally flattened, more stretched in the palmar direction; a wide
and squared anconeal process; a straight and regular shaft; a distal epiphysis mediolaterally com-
pressed with a concave articular surface for the triquetrum and a distally developed styloid process; a
proximally extended articular facet for the pisiform. The theoretical shape at the PC2 maximum dis-
plays a more massive and medially concave shape with an olecranon process mediolaterally inflated
and rounded in the palmar direction; an anconeal process little developed dorsally and laterally tilted;
an articular surface constituting the trochlear notch proximodistally compressed and extending medi-
ally; a mediolaterally wide articular surface for the triquetrum; a little developed styloid process; an
articular surface for the pisiform poorly extended proximally and square-shaped.

             Femur

The first two axes of the PCA performed on the femur express 45.0% of the global variance (Figure
11A). The first principal component (36.1%) clearly isolates Ds. sumatrensis on the positive part from
the other species. The clusters of Dc. bicornis, R. sondaicus and R. unicornis overlap on the negative
part of the axis. Dc. bicornis and R. unicornis specimens overlap a significant part of the cluster of C.
simum too. The general pattern observed on the Neighbour Joining tree is closer to the humerus one,
with African and Asiatic species grouped together, respectively (see Appendix 3D). The theoretical
shape at the PC1 minimum (Figure 11B, D, F, H) shows a massive morphology with large epiphyses
and a curved medial border, conferring a concave aspect to the diaphysis axis; a large femoral head,
off-centred relatively to the shaft main axis, supported by a very large neck; a small and shallow fovea
capitis oriented mediocaudally; a greater trochanter convexity expanding strongly laterodistally; the
absence of trochanteric notch between the convexity and the top of the trochanter (Figure 11F); a
proximodistally reduced trochanteric fossa; a sharp lesser trochanter running along the medial edge,
which is craniocaudally flattened below the humeral head; a third trochanter extending strongly

laterally, cranially and proximally towards the greater trochanter convexity, and much curved towards
the medial direction; a quite irregular shaft section along the bone – flattened below the proximal
epiphysis and more trapezoidal towards the distal epiphysis; a broad distal epiphysis with developed
medial and lateral epicondyles; a shallow supracondylar fossa; a wide trochlea, with a main rotation
axis aligned with the shaft axis; a large and cranially expanded medial ridge of the trochlea separated
from the lateral one by a deep trochlear groove; a medial condyle surface area larger than the lateral
condyle one, both being separated by a narrow intercondylar space. At the opposite, the theoretical
shape at the PC1 maximum (Figure 11C, E, G, I) is more slender with a straight and regular shaft; a
rounded femoral head aligned with the shaft main axis and supported by a thinner neck; a more pro-
nounced and rounded fovea capitis oriented almost completely caudally; a greater trochanter convex-
ity little developed laterodistally; a more pronounced trochanter top despite the absence of trochan-
teric notch; a thin lesser trochanter situated on the caudal border of the medial side; a rounded third
trochanter more developed laterally than cranially; a quite regular and trapezoidal shaft section; a
distal epiphysis mediolaterally broader and oriented medially; an almost absent supracondylar fossa;
a less developed medial trochlear ridge separated from the lateral one by a shallow trochlear groove;
a lateral condyle more oblique and divergent relatively to the medial one, increasing the intercondylar
space; symmetrical medial and lateral condylar surfaces.

The second axis (8.9%) clearly opposes Ds. sumatrensis, C. simum and Dc. bicornis on the positive part
to the two Rhinoceros species on the negative part, the cluster of Ds. sumatrensis being driven towards
negative values by a single individual. The theoretical shape at the PC2 minimum is mainly character-
ized by a flattened femoral head with a strong neck; a rounded and large fovea capitis oriented medi-
ocaudally; a greater trochanter convexity laterodistally expanded; a long and thin lesser trochanter; an
extremely developed third trochanter in lateral, cranial and proximal directions; a straight and regular
shaft; a broad distal epiphysis with important development of both epicondyles; a trochlea rotation
axis aligned with the main axis of the shaft. The theoretical shape at the PC2 maximum displays a more
rounded head, with a more stretched neck; no fovea capitis at all but a little groove on the head border;
a greater trochanter convexity little expanded laterodistally; a short and more medially developed
lesser trochanter; a rounded third trochanter little developed in cranial and proximal directions; a
straight shaft; a distal epiphysis less mediolaterally broad; a narrower intercondylar space; a more in-
flated medial condyle.

The first two axes of the PCA performed on the tibia express 50.0% of the global variance (Figure 12A).

simum, R. sondaicus and R. unicornis on the negative part. Dc. bicornis shows an important intraspecific

variation along both axes. Neighbour Joining tree structure is less clear than for previous bones: both
Rhinoceros species isolate from most of the other specimens, C. simum appears also separated from
Dc. bicornis and Ds. sumatrensis. However, one C. simum and three Ds. sumatrensis specimens are
closer from the Rhinoceros group than from their own respective species (see Appendix 3E). The the-
oretical shape at the PC1 minimum (Figure 12B, D, F, H) shows a massive morphology with broad shaft
and epiphyses, both in craniocaudal and mediolateral directions; medial and lateral intercondylar tu-
bercles having the same height and a reduced central intercondylar area; a broad cranial intercondylar
area; a medial articular surface larger than the lateral one, with the sliding surface for the m. popliteus
tendon extending caudally; a U-shaped popliteal notch; a rounded tibial tuberosity, laterally deflected
and medially bordered by a shallow groove; a shallow extensor groove; a regularly triangular proximal
articular surface for the fibula extending distally; a thick tibial crest disappearing at the middle of the
shaft, where the bone section is the smallest; a distal epiphysis mediolaterally broad and rectangular
in section; a distal articular surface for the fibula reduced in height and triangular-shaped, surmounted
by a smooth interosseous crest running towards the middle of the shaft; a distal articular surface for
the talus roughly rectangular, with a lateral groove larger and shallower than the medial one, sepa-
rated by a prominent intermediate process without synovial fossa; an articular surface with a rotation
axis aligned with the bone main axis; a prominent medial malleolus. The theoretical shape at the PC1
maximum (Figure 12C, E, G, I) displays a relatively gracile morphology with a thin shaft; a lateral inter-
condylar tubercle more proximally extended than the medial one and a relatively large central inter-
condylar area; a lateral condylar surface extending cranially, reducing the cranial intercondylar area;
medial and lateral articular roughly equal surface areas; a V-shaped popliteal notch; a tibial tuberosity
slightly more laterally deflected; a deeper tuberosity groove; a nail-shaped proximal articular surface
for the fibula; a sharper tibial crest disappearing just before the first half of the shaft; a distal epiphysis
more compressed craniocaudally; a distal articular surface for the fibula displaying a large triangle
synostosis area occupying a third of the shaft and prolonged by a sharp interosseous crest. There is no
major difference in the distal articular shape between PC1 maximum and minimum, except that the
caudal apophysis is less prominent in the distal direction.

The second axis (20.9%) clearly separates the two African species (C. simum and Dc. bicornis) on the
positive part from the three Asian species (Ds. sumatrensis, R. sondaicus and R. unicornis) on the neg-
ative part. The theoretical shape at the PC2 minimum displays a slightly more slender morphology; a
proximal plateau higher cranially than caudally and forming a closer angle with the diaphysis axis; a
high intercondylar eminence; a lateral articular surface more caudally extended than the medial one;
a tibial tuberosity well separated from the condyles by deep tuberosity and extensor grooves; a straight
shaft ending with divergent borders forming a large and rectangular distal epiphysis; a distal articular

surface for the fibula forming a regular triangle surmounted by a sharp interosseous crest; a medially
extended medial malleolus, resulting in a rectangular articular surface with the talus, where the medial
groove is narrow and deep, occupying a third of the area, whereas the lateral groove is shallow and
broad. The theoretical shape at the PC2 maximum displays a more massive morphology, with a crani-
ocaudal inflation of the epiphyses; a proximal plateau almost perpendicular to the diaphysis axis; a
lower intercondylar eminence; a lateral condyle surface almost twice less large than the medial one,
which is more developed caudally; a massive tibial tuberosity strongly deviated laterally, delimited by
very shallow tuberosity and extensor grooves and resulting in a very large cranial intercondylar area;
a straight shaft ending with almost parallel medial and lateral borders and a square-shaped distal
epiphysis; a medial malleolus less medially deflated; a squared distal articular surface for the talus with
medial and lateral grooves showing similar surface area and depth.

             Fibula

The first two axes of the PCA performed on the fibula express 55.9% of the global variance (Figure 13).
Contrary to the five previous analyses, the first axis (40.7%) here seems particularly driven by a strong
intraspecific variation. The clusters of C. simum and Ds. sumatrensis are stretched along the PC1 and
overlap with almost every other specimen. The cluster of Dc. bicornis is quite stretched along the axis
too and only the two Rhinoceros species display less intraspecific variation. This pattern does not seem
linked to sex, age class or condition (wild or captive): despite the presence of slightly more females
and subadults on the negative part of the component, I did not consider this observation as robust
enough to state on this question. This cluster distribution along the PC1 seems linked to the presence
of irregular crests along the shaft, associated with an important variation of the outline of the crests
running along the diaphysis, and a slight rotation of the fibular head (see Appendix 2 of this chapter).
Consequently, I chose to display and analyse the specimen distribution along the second and third
components instead. Theoretical shapes associated with the PC1 are available in the Appendix 2 of this
chapter.

PC2 and PC3 express 22.9% of the global variance (Figure 14A). The second component (15.2%) op-
poses C. simum on the negative side to Ds. sumatrensis on the positive side, whereas Dc. bicornis, R.
sondaicus and R. unicornis have a more central disposition. Like for the tibia, the Neighbour Joining
tree structure appears less clearly sorted by species than for other bones. If Rhinoceros species group
together and African ones as well, Ds. sumatrensis sample is split in two subgroups mixed with R. uni-
cornis and African rhinos respectively (see Appendix 3F). The theoretical shape at the PC2 minimum
(Figure 14B, D, F, H, J) displays a broad morphology with large epiphyses and a straight shaft; a rounded
head with a proximal articular surface for the tibia craniomedially oriented; a head width similar to the
shaft one; a robust shaft with two strong craniolateral and caudolateral lines running down the distal

crest; a distal epiphysis mediolaterally compressed with little development of the two distal tubercles
at the end of the lateral crests; a shallow lateral groove; a triangular distal articular surface for the
tibia, occupying only the last distal quarter of the bone length; a short and ovoid articular surface for
the talus with a sharp distal ridge. The theoretical shape at the PC2 maximum (Figure 14C, E, G, I, K)
displays a slender morphology with a strongly curved shaft; a mediolaterally flat head extending crani-
ocaudally and overhanging strongly the diaphysis; a thin shaft with two sharp lateral crests running
along it: these crests end with two developed tubercles surrounding a deep lateral groove; a distal
articular surface for the tibia extending from the distal third of the shape and forming a stretched
triangle; a wider and kidney-shaped articular surface for the talus, forming two distal tips responding
to the two lateral tubercles: between them on the distal face, a large groove is visible, ending at the
centre of the face.

The third component (7.7%) mainly opposes Dc. bicornis on the positive part to R. sondaicus on the
negative part. However, this opposition is mainly driven by a small number of individuals (two for Dc.
bicornis and four for R. sondaicus). The specimens of R. sondaicus are divided into two clusters, with
three individuals overlapping notably with Ds. sumatrensis. The theoretical shape at the PC3 minimum
shows a massive morphology, with broad shaft and epiphyses; a craniocaudally broad head, over-

ally; a straight shaft displaying a constant width along the bone; craniolateral and caudolateral crests
running almost parallel towards the distal end of the bone, forming two developed tubercles surround-
ing a deep groove; an interosseous space covered by irregular reliefs and bordered by a sharp interos-
seous crest; a distal articular surface for the tibia forming a triangle cranially deported; a kidney-shaped
distal articular surface for the talus, with a distal border separated from the lateral tubercles by a
groove stopping at the middle of the distal face. The theoretical shape at the PC3 maximum shows an
extremely thin morphology with a flattened and poorly developed head; a proximal articular surface
oriented almost completely in the cranial direction; a torsion of almost 90 degrees between the orien-
tation of the proximal and distal articular surfaces for the tibia; a very thin and flat shaft; craniolateral
and caudolateral crests running along the diaphysis ending on the distal epiphysis with few developed
tubercles; a distal articular surface for the tibia forming a slender triangle; a relatively small distal ar-
ticular surface for the talus, with a less pronounced kidney-shape; a groove on the distal face mediola-
terally compressed.

          Interspecific morphological variation
In addition to global interspecific patterns of shape, I shortly describe the main morphological features
characterizing each species. Mean shapes of each bone for the five species are available in Appendix 4
of this chapter.

Limb long bones of C. simum present a general massive and robust aspect. The humerus is thick and
shows a strong development of the lesser tubercle and the lateral epicondyle, as well as a proximal
broadening in the craniocaudal direction. The radius and ulna are robust and display an important
medial development of the articular parts constituting the trochlear notch. The ulna bears a strong
olecranon tubercle. The distal articular surface for the carpals constituted by the two bones is medi-
olaterally wide and compressed in the craniocaudal direction. The hind limb bones are robust as well,
this robustness being mainly expressed in the mediolateral direction for the femur. This bone displays
a rounded and thick head, strong greater and third trochanters, and a distal trochlea laterally oriented.
The tibia and fibula are robust as well, with a wide tibial plateau supporting the knee articulation and
a squared distal articulation for the talus.

For Dc. bicornis, the general aspect of the humerus is close to the one observed on C. simum, particu-
larly for the epiphyses (e.g. the shape of the bicipital groove, the development of the lesser tubercle
and of the lateral epicondyle), though its degree of robustness is less intense. The radius is relatively
slender but the proximal articular surface displays a cranial border with a marked groove under the
coronoid process, also observed on C. simum. The ulna is slender as well with a thin olecranon process

and limited medial development. Both distal epiphyses form a mediolaterally wide articular surface for
the carpals, poorly craniocaudally compressed. As for hind limb bones, the femur is only slightly robust,
with poorly developed trochanters and a slender diaphysis. Tibia and fibula are less thick too, with a
squared articular surface for the talus as well. Dc. bicornis displays noticeable morphological similari-
ties with C. simum.

The bone general morphology is very similar between both R. sondaicus and R. unicornis, being often
more robust in R. sondaicus. For these two species, the humerus displays an important development
of both lesser and greater tubercles, resulting in an asymmetrical bicipital groove. The greater tubercle
is even sometimes higher than the lesser one in R. sondaicus, which is not the case in R. unicornis. The
distal epiphysis is wide but with a medial epicondyle less developed than in C. simum and Dc. bicornis,
and a rectangular olecranon fossa. The radius exhibits mediolaterally large epiphyses and a quite ro-
bust diaphysis, with a proximal articular surface similar in both Rhinoceros species, with a straight cra-
nial border unlike in African rhinos. The distal epiphysis is rectangular and craniocaudally compressed.
R. unicornis distinguishes from R. sondaicus in having a more robust radius, with a more asymmetrical
proximal epiphysis, a deeper radial tuberosity and a larger distal articular surface. The ulna is also very
similar, the one of R. unicornis being slightly more robust. The general aspect remains extremely close,
with a developed olecranon, a medial development of the articular surface constituting the trochlear
notch and a quite wide distal articular surface. On the hind limb, the femur appears different, the R.
unicornis one showing important development of the greater and third trochanters, sometimes fused
by a bony bridge as previously stated by Guérin (1980). The femur of R. sondaicus appears slightly less
robust, and the greater and third trochanters are less developed and never fused. On the tibia, the
proximal plateau is as wide as for the African taxa but the tibial tuberosity is more detached from the
condyles by deep tuberosity and extensor grooves. The diaphysis is relatively thick and the distal artic-
ular surface is clearly rectangular. The fibula is very similar as well in the two species, with a distal
epiphysis curved in the caudal direction and a kidney-shaped articular surface for the talus.

Ds. sumatrensis clearly differs from the other species. Despite clear rhinocerotid features, limb long
bones display unique morphological traits, with a more pronounced slenderness. On the humerus, the
development of the greater tubercle results in a more closed and asymmetrical bicipital groove. The
distal epiphysis is mediolaterally narrow with a straight trochlea axis. The thin radius possesses a prox-
imal articular surface almost symmetrical despite a medial glenoid cavity slightly more developed. The
ulna is thin as well, and forms with the radius a rectangular articular surface for the carpals. The femur
shows a high and rounded head and a poorly developed third trochanter. The distal trochlea axis is
more medially oriented. On the tibia, the plateau is far less wide than in other species and the distal
articular surface for the talus is rectangular. The thin fibula displays a large head caudally bordered by

a thin crest and the diaphysis is strongly curved medially towards the tibia. The kidney-shape of the
distal articular surface for the talus resembles the Rhinoceros ones.

           Correlation with the centroid size
Table 3 provides the results of the Pearson’s correlation tests between the centroid size and the two
first principal components for each bone (and the third component for the fibula). There is a significant
correlation in each case between the first component and the centroid size, with higher correlation
coefficient values for the radius and ulna, and smaller values for the humerus and fibula. The second
principal component is also significantly correlated with the centroid size for the humerus, femur and
fibula, with smaller correlation coefficient values than for PC1, except for the humerus.

           Allometry
Table 4 and Table 5 provide the main anatomical differences observed between theoretical shapes
associated with minimal and maximal centroid size for the forelimb and hind limb bones, respectively.
Theoretical shapes associated with minimal and maximal log centroid size are provided in Appendix 5
of this chapter. In the case of the fibula, I found a pattern very close to the one observed along the
second axis of the PCA. Replacing the log centroid size by the cube root of the mean mass of each
species results in almost identical theoretical shapes for each bone (Figure 15 and Appendix 6 of this

shapes associated with minimum and maximum of log centroid size are slightly more massive than the
ones obtained with the cube root of the body mass for the humerus, the tibia and the fibula. All theo-

Table 6 and Table 7 provide the results of the two Procrustes ANOVAs performed on shape data, where
the log centroid size and the cube root of the mean body mass were, respectively, the independent
variable. Log centroid size is significantly correlated with shape for the six bones, with a determination
coefficient varying between 0.10 for the fibula and 0.18 for the ulna. In every case, the determination
coefficient is more than twice as high for species affiliation as for log centroid size, indicating a more
important influence of group affiliation than of allometry. This is especially the case for the humerus,
with a determination coefficient of 0.53 for species affiliation and of only 0.13 for log centroid size.

Cube root of mean body mass is also significantly correlated with shape for the six bones, with slightly
higher determination coefficient values than those obtained with the log centroid size. The humerus,
the radius and the femur display the highest coefficients, between 0.33 and 0.26. These higher values
may be due to the use of a same mean body mass for each rhino species instead of individual mass.
Moreover, group affiliation could not be used in this case because of the mean body mass redundancy.

Multivariate regressions of shape scores against log-transformed centroid size (Figure 16) show that
Ds. sumatrensis has the smallest centroid size and is well separated from the other rhino species in
most cases, except for the tibia and fibula. R. unicornis possesses the highest centroid size in most of
the cases, except for the radius and ulna, where it shares similar centroid size values and shape scores
as C. simum (Table 8). Different tendencies can be observed: for the humerus, Asiatic rhinos have lower
shape scores than African ones for a given size. Radius and ulna data display a point pattern similar to

each other, with the isolation of Ds. sumatrensis towards low values, a second cluster formed by Dc.
bicornis and R. sondaicus at average values, and a third cluster with C. simum and R. unicornis showing
the highest values. This separation in three groups can be observed at a lesser extent for the femur,
where Dc. bicornis and R. sondaicus share almost the same centroid size and shape score variations,
whereas C. simum and R. unicornis are separated by their respective centroid size despite similar shape
scores. Finally, tibia and fibula display rather similar patterns with an important intraspecific shape
variation, notably for Ds. sumatrensis and Dc. bicornis. There is a more important continuity between
the different clusters for the tibia and the fibula than for other bones, where clusters are more sepa-
rated from each other.

Discussion
          Identification of morphotypes and phylogenetic influence
Morphological variation isolates each rhino species from the others, more or less clearly depending on
the bone considered. The shape analysis of the six bones allows for clear isolation of three general
bone morphotypes: the African morphotype grouping C. simum and Dc. bicornis, the Rhinoceros mor-
photype grouping the two Rhinoceros species, and the Ds. sumatrensis morphotype. The congruence
of these morphotypes with the phylogeny indicates that the phylogenetic signal on long bone shape is
strong, although it fluctuates among bones. In addition, body mass also appears as an important factor,
depending on the considered bones. The phylogeny is clearly the main effect driving the shapes of the
humerus and femur. Conversely, the morphological variation observed on the radius and ulna is es-
sentially associated with body mass. The tibia seems to be equally affected by both, which is also the
case for the fibula that shows, in addition, an important intraspecific variation.

Despite the fact that I could not test the phylogenetic signal because of the small number of studied
species (Adams, 2014), my observations tend to indicate an effect of phylogenetic relations. It is ac-
cepted that the two African rhino C. simum and Dc. bicornis are closely related (Tougard et al., 2001).
They may belong to the same subfamily – called Dicerotinae (Guérin, 1982; Gaudry, 2017) or Rhinoce-
rotinae (Antoine, 2002; Becker, Antoine & Maridet, 2013), depending on the authors. The two species
composing the genus Rhinoceros are also closely related (Tougard et al., 2001), the bones of R. unicor-
nis and R. sondaicus having sometimes been confused with each other (Groves & Leslie, 2011). Con-
versely, the phylogenetic position of Ds. sumatrensis remains debated (Willerslev et al., 2009; Gaudry,
2017), this species being considered alternately as sister taxon of the two African species (Antoine,
Duranthon & Welcomme, 2003; Cappellini et al., 2019), of the two Rhinoceros species (Tougard et al.,
2001; Welker et al., 2017) or of all four other rhino species (Fernando et al., 2006; Piras et al., 2010)
(see Chapter 1). Analyses reveal equally contrasting relationship patterns, with Ds. sumatrensis more
closely resembling African species for some bones (radius, ulna and tibia) and other Asiatic ones for
the others (humerus, femur and fibula).

Some anatomical features seem strongly influenced by phylogenetic relationships, among which some
have previously been used as characters for cladistics analyses (Prothero, Manning & Hanson, 1986;
Cerdeño, 1995; Antoine, 2002). On the humerus, the bicipital groove allows the sliding of a large m.
biceps brachii, a forearm flexor playing an important locomotor role in coordinating the scapula and
arm movements (Watson & Wilson, 2007; Barone, 2010b). This groove appears more closed by the
greater tubercle for Asiatic rhinos, potentially indicating a different length and shape for the transverse
humeral ligament. Although most analyses (Prothero, Manning & Hanson, 1986; Antoine, 2002) have

coded a few characters related to the tubercles of the humerus, the complexity of the shape of this
bone proximal epiphysis remains generally underestimated in phylogenetic reconstructions. Moreo-
ver, the case of the greater tubercle development observed on the humerus of Asiatic species, and
mainly for Ds. sumatrensis, is of particular interest (see Appendix 4 of this chapter). As mentioned by
Hermanson & MacFadden (1992), the greater tubercle “increases mechanical advantages” for the mm.
pectoralis ascendens, supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Ds. sumatrensis displays the slenderest hu-
merus of all modern rhinos, with morphological traits qualitatively close to tapirs’ (MacLaren & Nau-
welaerts, 2016). The proximal epiphysis of Ds. sumatrensis resembles the tapirs’ one, regarded by
some authors as a plesiomorphic condition among Perissodactyla (Prothero, Manning & Hanson, 1986;
Hermanson & MacFadden, 1992; Antoine, 2002). This particular shape may thus represent an evolu-
tionary heritage and it is unclear whether and how functional constraints may have also affected this
shape. The greater tubercle being also an insertion area for the m. supraspinatus, extension move-
ments thus seem achieved differently between African and Asiatic rhinos. Watson & Wilson (2007)
showed that the m. supraspinatus in horses acts more as a shoulder stabilizer than as a true extensor
of the shoulder. Given the qualitative similarity of shape of this joint between African rhinos and
equids, it is likely that this muscle plays a similar role among these groups. The robustness of the lesser
trochanter is consistent with a development of the medial part of the m. supraspinatus, to increase
the shoulder stabilisation. The lever arm is medially deflected for C. simum and Dc. bicornis, and dis-
tributed both medially and laterally for Rhinoceros species and Ds. sumatrensis. The role of the shoul-
der joint remains crucial in weight bearing and locomotion, and its shape may be influenced by several
factors. The development of a massive greater tubercle is encountered among hippos (Fisher, Scott &
Naples, 2007) and may be interpreted as a direct link with semi-aquatic habits and displacements into
muddy swamps or riverbanks. However, this particular morphology is also encountered among domes-
tic bovids for example (Barone, 2010a), which are not semi-aquatic. Conversely, extinct Amynodonti-
dae, presumed to have been semi-aquatic Oligocene rhinos (Averianov et al., 2017), did not display
this greater tubercle development (Scott & Jepsen, 1941). The development of the greater tubercle
can rather be interpreted as an indicator of a powerful shoulder extension, as well as a feature increas-
ing the resistance to displacement on unstable substrates. However, only a comprehensive study of
this convergent trait among diverse artiodactyls and perissodactyls taxa could help to understand the
functional role of this anatomical region, and its potential link with the ecological habits. On the distal
epiphysis, characters related to the shape of the olecranon fossa have been used in phylogenies
(Heissig, 1972; Antoine, 2002). Results confirm that the shape and depth of this fossa do not seem
directly linked to the general bone robustness as observed in these studies. Moreover, this fossa is
proximodistally larger for the genus Rhinoceros than for Ceratotherium and Diceros.

On the femur, the fovea capitis is extremely reduced in C. simum and absent in Dc. bicornis, whereas
it is well developed in Asiatic rhinos, especially in R. sondaicus, confirming previous observations
(Guérin, 1980; Antoine, 2002). This fovea provides an attachment for the accessory ligament and the
femoral head ligament (Hermanson & Macfadden, 1996), acting as a hip stabilizer. The absence or
reduction of fovea capitis in African species may be both associated with their phylogenetic proximity.
This fovea is indeed present in many fossil rhinos (Antoine, 2002), regardless of the ecological prefer-
ences of these species. The shapes of the greater and of the third trochanters also seem driven more
by the phylogeny than by functional constraints, supporting their use in phylogenies (Cerdeño, 1995;
Antoine, 2002). On the distal epiphysis, the medial trochlear ridge is more developed and inflated in
all rhinos than in horses; this feature has been previously interpreted as associated with “locking” the
knee joint during long standing periods in equids (Hermanson & Macfadden, 1996) and considered as
functionally equivalent in rhinos (Shockey, 2001). Other authors saw in the development of this medial
trochlear ridge an adaptation to a more important degree of cursoriality, linked to openness of habitat
(Janis et al., 2012). But tapirs, yet able to gallop (Sanborn & Watkins, 1950), do not display such an
enlargement of the medial ridge of the trochlea (Holbrook, 2001; C.M. pers. obs.). This trait may thus
be phylogenetically inherited between horses and rhinos only, or results of a convergence towards a
knee-locking apparatus (which has yet to be fully demonstrated for rhinos).

On the tibia, the massive development of the tibial tuberosity seems more pronounced among African
species than in Asiatic ones. The angle between the tibial plateau and the shaft axis is interpreted as a
functional character linked to the limb posture (Lessertisseur & Saban, 1967); a plateau caudally low-
ered may reflect an angled limb associated with a cursorial habit, whereas a horizontal plateau tends
to indicate more columnar limbs. Here, despite a slight change in the plateau orientation between light
and heavy rhino species, this trait seems more likely related to phylogeny, African species having a
more horizontal plateau than African ones. Similarly, on the distal epiphysis, the rectangular shape of
the articular surface for the talus is encountered mainly in the three Asiatic species and not in African
specimens.

         Role of ecology
Phylogenetically related rhinos share ecologies with important similarities, making it difficult to accu-
rately assess the environmental effect on bone shape. Furthermore, as historical ranges and habitats
of rhinos have been drastically reduced and modified under human pressure (Hillman-Smith & Groves,
1994; Dinerstein, 2011; Groves & Leslie, 2011; Rookmaaker & Antoine, 2012), ecological inferences
must be assessed with caution regarding the current rhino habitats. The related C. simum and Dc. bi-
cornis both live in African savannas and display a common general bone morphotype (see above). Dc.
bicornis is a ubiquitous species, often visiting both open savannas and clear forests and browsing

various vegetal species, whereas C. simum is an open grassland grazer (Dinerstein, 2011). The same
assessment can be done for the two Rhinoceros species, closely phylogenetically related and sharing
an important part of their historical geographic range. Despite their strong affinity with water, their
ecological preferences are quite different, R. unicornis feeding frequently in semi-open floodplains
whereas R. sondaicus prefers denser forests. R. sondaicus and Ds. sumatrensis share a similar lifestyle
in dense and closed forest habitats but only their humerus, femur and fibula tend to display slight
shape similarities. If long bone shape is affected by environmental factors, these constraints are diffi-
cult to distinguish from the ones linked to phylogeny. This tends to confirm previous observations in-
dicating that rhino long bones can hardly be used as accurate environmental markers (Guérin, 1980;
Eisenmann & Guérin, 1984).

          Shape variation, evolutionary allometry and functional implications
Increase in body size and mass between the lightest and heaviest rhinos is associated with a global
broadening of the limb long bones, with a clear enlargement of both the diaphysis and epiphyses,
confirming previous general observations on different mammalian clades (Bertram & Biewener, 1990,
1992). However, this broadening is not uniform for all the bones. It is directed both mediolaterally and
craniocaudally for the humerus (especially for the proximal part), and mainly mediolaterally for the
radius and the femur. Conversely, for the ulna, tibia and fibula, I rather observe a craniocaudal enlarge-
ment, particularly visible on the proximal part of the tibia.

             Forelimb bones

The difference between high and low size among extant rhinos is expressed on the humerus by a gen-
eral enlargement in both craniocaudal and mediolateral directions, particularly for the proximal first
half. This may be related to the constraints exerted both by weight bearing and braking role of the
forelimb during locomotion (Dutto et al., 2006). The important development of the lesser tubercle at
the expense of the greater tubercle in non-Dicerorhinus species allows both a greater stability of the
shoulder articulation, preventing hyperextension, and a larger insertion area for the medial head of
the m. supraspinatus, also considered as a shoulder stabilizer (Fisher, Scott & Naples, 2007; Watson &
Wilson, 2007). This muscle being one of the main extensors of the forelimb (Barone, 2010b), the de-
veloped lesser tubercle acts as a strong medial lever arm for extension movements. This configuration
has been previously interpreted as a mechanical advantage for muscles inserting on the shoulder joint,
while the lateral reinforcement of the greater tubercle was supposed to help resisting the adduction
of the arm (Hermanson & MacFadden, 1992). The development of the lesser trochanter may also help
supporting the scapula (more elongated among African rhinos, J. MacLaren, 2019, personal communi-
cation) and be associated with a lengthening of the m. subscapularis tendons. In addition, the lesser
tubercle also displays an important development in Dc. bicornis, more pronounced than in R. unicornis

and R. sondaicus, though these species are heavier and taller. This indicates a possible effect of phylo-
genetic proximity or similar habitats between the African species (see above). The development of the
intermediate tubercle for some rhinos may be related to the presence of a forelimb passive stay appa-
ratus, as demonstrated in horses (Hermanson & MacFadden, 1992; Mihlbachler et al., 2014). Although
less developed than in equids, the intermediate tubercle is present in all rhinos at different degrees
(well visible in African taxa, less developed in Rhinoceros species and poorly developed in Dicerorhi-
nus). This may indicate different degrees of development of passive stay mechanism possibly linked to
phylogeny and ecology (Shockey, 2001). On the distal epiphysis of the humerus, the mediolateral en-
largement observed towards high body mass ensures both a greater stability of the elbow articulation
and larger insertion areas for the different flexor and extensor muscles for the digits (Barone, 2010a).
The distal trochlea of the humerus is also subjected to a proximodistal compression and a mediolateral
extension, increasing the articular surface area to dissipate compressive forces, important for main-
taining posture at high body masses (Jenkins, 1973).

Forelimb paired zeugopodial bones seem to express complementary shape variations linked to body
mass. Whereas the radius broadens mainly mediolaterally with increasing body mass, the ulna expands
in the craniocaudal direction; they respond conjointly to the increase in body mass and bone size to
form a structure reinforced in all directions, as it has been observed on the humerus. All rhinos have
an ulnar proximal epiphysis situated caudal to the radius, while its shaft expands laterally, possibly
allowing a mediolateral weight display. Moreover, almost all the weight is borne by the proximal artic-
ular surface of the radius (Bertram & Biewener, 1992), which expands medially and becomes asym-
metrical for heavier rhinos. The concave radial tuberosity shows a deep m. biceps brachii insertion
delivering a strong forearm flexion (Antoine, 2002) and the developed insertion lateral relief offers a
greater surface for extensor muscles of the digits (Guérin, 1980). As this relief is more developed in
African species than in Asiatic ones, this may suggest an effect of phylogeny or locomotion in different
habitats or both. On the ulna, the developed olecranon process constitutes a powerful lever arm for
forearm extensors such as the m. triceps brachii and the m. anconeus, also acting upon the bone for
gravitational support. The medial development of the olecranon process is related to larger insertions
for the mm. flexor carpi radialis, flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis, all es-
sential to resist hyperextension of the wrist. The cranially reduced anconeal process allows a greater
extension of the forearm than in other taxa (e.g. bovids or equids) (Hildebrand, 1974) but prevents a
complete verticality of the member as observed in elephants for example (Osborn, 1929). The distal
epiphysis shows a reduction of both radial and ulnar styloid processes towards high body mass, adding
a mediolateral degree of freedom to the wrist articulation. However, the proximally reduced articular
surface for the scaphoid limits the craniocaudal wrist flexion (Yalden, 1971). These morphological traits

allow the foot to bear the weight on different substrates while limiting the risk of wrist hyperflexion
(Domning, 2002).

             Hind limb bones

In the hind limb, the femur expands mainly in the mediolateral direction for rhinos with high body
mass and bone size, tending to indicate a stronger resistance to constraints both linked to body pro-
pulsion and weight bearing (Lessertisseur & Saban, 1967), exerted in the mediolateral direction (Hil-
debrand, 1974). The mediolateral reinforcement of the femur is mainly located under the head and
the neck, responding to a concomitant enlargement of the medial condyle and epicondyle on the distal
epiphysis, both indicating an increase of the body load near the sagittal plane. The more distal location
of the lesser trochanter improves the lever arm of the mm. psoas major and iliacus, developing slower
but stronger hip flexions (Hildebrand, 1974; Polly, 2007). The same phenomenon is observed with the
third trochanter, situated half way along shaft – contrary to in cursorial Perissodactyla like equids,
where the third trochanter is more proximally situated (Hermanson & Macfadden, 1996; Holbrook,
2001; Barone, 2010a). However, it has been shown that the relative position of the third trochanter
barely varies among extinct rhinoceroses considered as “cursorial” or “semi-cursorial” (Prothero,
2005). This position along the shaft may thus be influenced by both mechanical and phylogenetic con-
straints. The extreme development of the third trochanter associated with a distolateral development
of the greater trochanter also creates a large lever arm for the fascia glutea, the mm. gluteus superfi-
cialis and gluteus medius allowing strong hip flexion and abduction. This association appears the great-
est for R. unicornis, where the greater and third trochanters can be fused by a bony bridge. Conversely,
the greater trochanter is less proximally developed than in related groups like horses and tapirs (Ra-
dinsky, 1965; Hermanson & Macfadden, 1996; Holbrook, 2001); as this trochanter is the insertion area
for the m. gluteus medius, the main extensor of the hip, the extension in rhinos seems less powerful
than in cursorial perissodactyls. On the distal epiphysis, the lateral torsion of the rotation axis of the
trochlea in heavy rhinos also indicates a more laterally deviated position of the knee. This confor-
mation may improve weight bearing, shifting the body mass laterally to the body, as previously ob-
served on a study of pressure patterns of the feet in C. simum (Panagiotopoulou, Pataky & Hutchinson,
2019). No real difference in the bone curvature related to body proportion was noticed, confirming
previous observations on the independence of femur curvature with regard to body mass increase in
quadrupedal mammals (Bertram & Biewener, 1992).

On the hindlimb zeugopodial elements, when the proximal epiphysis of the tibia broadens cranio-
caudally, the proximal fibular epiphysis is reduced in this direction, despite an increased general ro-
bustness. The proximal epiphysis of the fibula is also oriented far more cranially than in lighter speci-
mens. The enlargement of the tibial plateau thus seems to involve a relative reduction in size of the

fibular head. The distal epiphyses of both bones covary too, with a broadening mainly expressed in the
craniocaudal direction. The medial condyle of the tibial plateau enlarges strongly, resulting into an
asymmetrical proximal epiphysis. Moreover, the broadening of the tibial tuberosity correlates with a
stronger and larger patellar ligament, reinforcing the knee articulation and therefore the lever arm
created by the patella (Hildebrand, 1974). On the distal epiphysis, the two malleoli are more mediola-
terally inflated but less distally expanded, allowing the tarsal articulation to move more freely in heav-
ier rhinos (Lessertisseur & Saban, 1967). This trait is associated with a slightly shallower distal articular
surface, conferring more important degrees of freedom to the ankle articulation for high body mass
(Polly, 2007). This observation is coherent with similar analyses conducted on rhino ankle bones
(Etienne et al., 2020) showing notably that the talus bone is flattened and has a shallower groove to-
wards high body mass among rhinos.

In addition to the reduction of the proximal epiphysis, the fibula displays a straighter diaphysis for large
rhinos as opposed to the greatly curved one for lighter rhinos (see Appendices 5 and 6 of this chapter).
This is consistent with previous observations: although the fibula was not considered in their study,
Bertram & Biewener (1992) noted a decrease of tibia curvature while body mass increases among ter-
restrial mammals. In my rhino sample, the tibia shows a very slight straightening of the diaphysis. How-
ever, this straightening, perhaps linked to load carrying capacity, appears to be more pronounced on
the fibula.

          Differences between body mass and body size
As the exact body mass was only known for five specimens of the sample, I was not able to precisely
express the shape variation regarding the animal’s individual weight. However, theoretical bone shape
obtained with mean body mass are very similar to the ones obtained with centroid size (see above).
Comparing the values of the centroid size and mean body mass highlights some interspecific differ-
ences: if Ds. sumatrensis, the smallest rhino, has the lowest values for both centroid size and body
mass, R. unicornis (the species with the highest values of shoulder height) displays the highest values
of centroid size in most cases, which is coherent with its higher height at shoulder compared to other
modern rhinos (Guérin, 1980; Dinerstein, 2011), despite a mean body mass (2,000 kg) lower than that
of C. simum (2,300 kg). Furthermore, the centroid size of an isolated bone may neither reflect the
actual global size of an animal, nor be strictly correlated with its body mass. This is particularly visible
for taxa displaying brachypodial adaptation (i.e. shortening of limb length relatively to the height at
the shoulder), as it is the case for modern hippos or some fossil rhinos like Brachypotherium or Tele-
oceras (Cerdeño, 1998). However, results indicate that it does not seem to be the case with the long
bones of modern rhinos. As bone size and body mass are intimately entangled (Berner, 2011), the
centroid size of isolated bones may still constitute a useful body mass approximation when precise

body mass remains unknown and if considered cautiously – this approximation depending on the num-
ber and placement of the landmarks on the bone. This is coherent with previous results obtained on
cranial shape data indicating a marked correlation between body mass and centroid size (both of the
skull and mandible) for many mammalian lineages, especially modern rhinos (Cassini, Vizcaíno & Bargo,
2012). Another study focusing on tapirs tend to highlight a good correlation between centroid size and
body mass estimation when using the forelimb elements (MacLaren et al., 2018).

         Limb bone shape and graviportality
One of the criteria defining graviportality is straight and columnar limbs (Gregory, 1912; Osborn, 1929;
Biewener, 1989b) (see Chapter 1). Rhino limb long bones do not display a true columnar organisation
(Osborn, 1900, 1929). Morphological changes between light and heavy rhino species do not imply a
clear change in the orientation of the articular facets: the elbow joint remains unable to completely
open like the elephant’s one and the knee remains markedly angled. Only the humeral proximal epiph-
ysis displays a tenuous orientation change between light and heavy rhinos, allowing a more slightly
vertical orientation of this bone for C. simum and R. unicornis.

Limb straightness can results from the reorientation of the trochlear notch of the ulna in the dorsal
direction, allowing an efficient support of the humerus (Gregory, 1912), as in proboscideans (Christi-
ansen, 1999). My sample tends to indicate instead that the radius is the main support of the body
weight in the forelimb among modern rhinos. The shape of the radius becomes gradually more robust
from light to heavy rhinos, with a strong medial reinforcement of the proximal epiphysis. The particular
role of the radius was previously highlighted among a large sample of mammal clades (Bertram &
Biewener, 1992), its vertical position being parallel to ground reaction forces. This supportive role of
the radius is widespread among ungulates and remains of importance even in larger fossil rhinos like
Elasmotheriinae (Antoine, 2002) and Paraceratheriidae (Qiu & Wang, 2007; Prothero, 2013). Unlike in
elephants, increase in body mass among rhinos is correlated with a more important supportive role of
the radius. At the opposite, the ulna’s role has not been extensively explored in morphofunctional
studies. This work underlines the complementary role of the ulna relative to the radius, providing more
lateral and caudal weight bearing by an enlargement in the dorsopalmar direction. In this regard, the
zeugopodial conformation in rhinos is close to the one encountered in hippos (Fisher, Scott & Naples,
2007).

Forelimb elements bear more weight than hind limb ones (Lessertisseur & Saban, 1967; Hildebrand,
1974; Polly, 2007) and play an additional braking role during locomotion, particularly proximal ele-
ments (Dutto et al., 2006). Forelimb bones such as the humerus thus need to be reinforced in all direc-
tions in order to support these higher masses in heavier animals. Hind limb bone shape is affected

differently than in forelimb by increases in body mass and size. The hind limb bears relatively less
weight than the forelimb in quadrupeds and plays an additional propulsive role during locomotion
(Lessertisseur & Saban, 1967; Hildebrand, 1974; Barone, 2010a). The femur displays important rein-
forcement and development of strong lever arms in large rhino species, possibly to support increasing
stress due to locomotion and body mass, but the variations in shape of the tibia and the fibula seem
driven as much by the body mass as by the phylogenetic influence. The shape of the fibula is particu-
larly variable within several rhino species, questioning its functional role but also the factors driving
this strong intraspecific variation. It has been shown that the human fibula plays, in addition to its
ankle stabilizer role, a small but important weight bearing role, receiving one sixth of the load applied
to the knee (Lambert, 1971; Takebe et al., 1984). In horses, the diaphysis of the fibula is absent and
the malleolus is fused with the tibia, ensuring mainly ankle stabilization (Barone, 2010a). The rhino
fibula ensures a talus stabilization role (Polly, 2007) in addition to a potential weight bearing due to
the presence of the shaft. In addition, this bone often bears crests along the diaphysis with no apparent
correlation with weight bearing (see above). These crest developments may be due to individual vari-
ations in bone development, without clear functional implications, but this first analysis does not allow
me to address this question.

Bertram & Biewener (1990, 1992) and Polly (2007) previously called “allometry increase” the tendency
for body size and mass to rise among terrestrial mammals. Although reduced, this allometry clearly
affects this sample (Tables 6 and 7). In addition, robustness increase is associated with a slight relative
length reduction of the bone for larger rhinos such as Ceratotherium (Guérin, 1980), a general trend
observed among heavy mammals (Christiansen, 1999). Another trait associated with body mass aug-
mentation among extant rhino species is the expansion of the medial epiphyses of multiple bones (e.g.,
medial epicondyle and trochlear lip on the humerus, medial glenoid cavity on the radius, medial con-
dyle and trochlear lip on the femur, medial condyle on the tibia). These medial reinforcements result
in more asymmetrical bones, potentially increasing parasagittal weight bearing (Barone, 2010a). This
conformation is coherent with foot posture during walk: rhino forefeet are placed under the body,
close to the sagittal plane of the animal (Paul & Christiansen, 2000). Hind feet are more spaced and
oriented laterally, especially for heavy rhinos (Pfistermüller, Walzer & Licka, 2011; Panagiotopoulou,
Pataky & Hutchinson, 2019), which seems to agree with my observations regarding the rotation axis
of the femoral trochlea, oriented more laterally as well. However, the distal articular surface of the
tibia displays a broader lateral groove and appears as a counterexample (Figure 12). This lateral broad-
ening of the ankle joint, also observed on the talus (Etienne et al., 2020), may be correlated with the
hind limb posture of rhinos. As the pelvic bone is large and the feet are placed under the body and
oriented more laterally than forefeet, the legs are not parallel to the sagittal plane (Paul & Christiansen,

2000; C.M. pers. obs.). The vertical forces exerted by the body mass may therefore cross the axis of
the tibia. This appears in accordance with the fact that the forces may be medially higher on the prox-
imal plateau but laterally higher at the ankle joint; this point would need to be tested more precisely
in vivo. As studies of pressure patterns indicate that foot pressure is more intense laterally (Pfistermül-
ler, Walzer & Licka, 2011; Panagiotopoulou, Pataky & Hutchinson, 2019), it will be crucial to explore
relations that exist between stylopodium, zeugopodium and autopodium organisation in the complete
limb, as well as the gait and posture of the rhinos.

Conclusion
This study conducted on the limb long bones among modern rhinos highlights the occurrence of three
distinct morphotypes. These reflect phylogenetic relationships, and the bone shape is differently af-
fected by body size and mass. All bones display a common increase of robustness towards high body
mass. The shape of the stylopodium bones, though affected by body mass variation, remains highly
constrained by phylogeny, whereas zeugopodial bones, especially the radius and ulna, are more
strongly affected by body mass, which highlights their important role in weight bearing. The shape of
the tibia is influenced by both body mass and phylogeny. The unique pattern of the fibula reveals that,
beyond significant intraspecific variation, this bone may play a role in weight bearing. All these results
obtained on isolated bones stimulated the exploration of how the shapes of the six bones covary, and
how body mass may impact these degrees of covariation.

Introduction 2
The morphology of the different anatomical parts constituting organisms are known to be influenced
by interactions between these parts due to shared developmental origin, phylogenetic legacy, func-
tional constraints or structural requirements (Olson & Miller, 1958; Van Valen, 1965; Cheverud, 1982;
Gould, 2002; Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall, 2002; Cubo, 2004; Goswami & Polly, 2010; Goswami et
al., 2014). The tendency of morphological traits to covary under the influence of these factors is known
as morphological integration (Olson & Miller, 1958; Van Valen, 1965). These factors can indeed in-
crease morphological integration of the whole body or parts of it, but they can also act locally to pro-
duce stronger covariation within parts than with other units (e.g. modules – Hallgrímsson et al. 2002;
Young & Hallgrímsson 2005; Klingenberg 2008; Goswami et al. 2014). Morphological integration is
therefore classically explored through the study of covariation between sets of linear measurements
or shape data (Van Valen, 1965; Klingenberg, 2008; Goswami & Polly, 2010; Bookstein, 2015).

Among tetrapods, the appendicular skeleton is a particularly integrated structure due to the common
developmental origin of its parts (serial homology – Young & Hallgrímsson 2005; Bininda-Emonds et
al. 2007; Sears et al. 2015) and shared functional constraints linked to locomotion and ecology (Hallgrí-
msson, Willmore & Hall, 2002; Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005; Goswami et al., 2014; Martín‐Serra et al.,
2015; Botton-Divet et al., 2018). In this framework, it has been hypothesized that the functional spe-
cialization of the appendicular skeleton is associated with a decrease of the integration level between
limbs and serially homologous elements, and an increase of the within-limb integration (Hallgrímsson,
Willmore & Hall, 2002; Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005). This has been particularly observed for some
extreme locomotor adaptations like flight in bats or bipedal locomotion in hominoids, which led to a
strong specialization of a specific part of the appendicular skeleton and consequently to a decrease of
the general integration (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005; Young, Wagner & Hallgrímsson, 2010; Bell, An-
dres & Goswami, 2011). Moreover, among quadrupedal mammals, the loss of the clavicle allows a
greater mobility of the scapula, playing an active role in locomotion (Gasc, 2001; Schmidt & Fischer,
2009). This led to a shift in the functional relations between limb parts, where the serially homologous
elements are not functionally analogous anymore (Gasc, 2001; Schmidt & Fischer, 2009) (Figure 17).
At the interspecific level (e.g. evolutionary integration – Klingenberg 2014), it has been shown that
many terrestrial taxa (equids, carnivorans, marsupials) present a strong general integration among all
their limb long bones (Bennett & Goswami, 2011; Kelly & Sears, 2011; Fabre et al., 2014b; Martín‐Serra

Benson, 2019), with a covariation mainly linked to the locomotion and shared phylogenetic history.
But few studies explored the patterns of morphological integration of the appendicular skeleton
among mammals at the intraspecific level (e.g. static or developmental integration – Klingenberg 2014)
and tempted to compare them with the patterns observed at the interspecific level (Young, Wagner &
Hallgrímsson, 2010; Hanot et al., 2017, 2018, 2019).

The support of a heavy mass is likely an important factor influencing the shape and integration of the
appendicular skeleton. As described in Chapter 1, many mammalian lineages displayed an increase of
their body mass along their evolutionary history (Depéret, 1907; Raia et al., 2012; Baker et al., 2015;
Bokma et al., 2016). Biomechanical studies indicate that the shape of the limb bones should be driven
by stress linked to mass support during the stance and the displacement of the animal (Hildebrand,
1974; Biewener, 1983, 1989a,b). However, few studies have explored the precise role exerted by body
mass on the shape variation of the limb bones (Biewener, 1983; Bertram & Biewener, 1992; Fabre et
al., 2013; Mallet et al., 2019). Likewise, the influence of body mass on integration patterns among limb
bones is poorly known. Previous studies on relatively light taxa indicated a limited effect of body mass
on integration patterns, overcome by other factors such as locomotor ecology (Martín‐Serra et al.,

                                                         120

2015; Botton-Divet et al., 2018; Martín-Serra & Benson, 2019). At the opposite, other works proposed
that body mass may still have an impact on the shape covariation of the limb long bones (Hanot et al.,
2017; Randau & Goswami, 2018), possibly more pronounced for heavier species (Schmidt & Fischer,
2009). Drawing on this and on the results presented in Chapter 3, I chose to explore the integration
patterns among modern rhinoceroses, constituting the second heaviest terrestrial group after ele-
phants among modern mammals (Alexander & Pond, 1992). Whereas body size and mass poorly vary
among the three species of elephants, the five modern species of rhinos surviving nowadays display a
wide range of body mass (BM): Dicerorhinus sumatrensis (Fischer, 1814) – mean BM: 775 kg; Diceros
bicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) – mean BM: 1,050 kg; Rhinoceros sondaicus Desmarest, 1822 – mean BM:
1,350 kg; Rhinoceros unicornis Linnaeus, 1758 – mean BM: 2,000 kg; and Ceratotherium simum
(Burchell, 1817) – mean BM: 2,300 kg (Dinerstein, 2011) (see Table 1 in Chapter 3). This range of body
mass can be highly variable within each species due to sexual dimorphism or between wild and captive
specimens: 600 – 950 kg for Ds. sumatrensis; 800 – 1,300 kg for Dc. bicornis; 1,200 – 1,500 kg for R.
sondaicus; 1,270 – 2,800 kg for R. unicornis; 1,350 – 3,500 kg for C. simum (Zschokke & Baur, 2002;
Dinerstein, 2011). While a few studies have explored the shape variation of their long bones in relation
to the ecology, phylogeny and functional constraints, such as body mass (Guérin, 1980; Eisenmann &
Guérin, 1984; Mallet et al., 2019), no work has focused on the integration of their appendicular skele-
ton and its relationship to these factors. The aim of this chapter is thus to explore shape covariation
patterns among limb long bones within and between species in order to highlight potential influence
of body mass.

In the chapter, I propose to investigate the integration patterns of the shape of the limb long bones
among the five species of modern rhinos, to quantify the integration level within and between limbs
and to explore whether body mass could influence covariation patterns. In order to describe precisely
the shape covariations by taking into consideration the whole shape of the bones in three dimensions,
my analyses were done using 3D geometric morphometrics. They were performed at both interspecific
and intraspecific levels, taking phylogenetic relationships into account where necessary (see Chapter
1 for details on phylogenetic uncertainties about modern rhinos). In accordance with previous works
and the findings of Chapter 3, I hypothesize that the shape of limb long bones among rhinos should
be: 1) strongly integrated as in other quadrupedal mammals at both interspecific and intraspecific lev-
els (Hanot et al., 2017); 2) relatively homogenous between fore- and hind limbs as in other quadru-
pedal mammals (Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Hanot et al., 2017); 3) more strongly integrated than in
lighter mammal species (Schmidt & Fischer, 2009); 4) showing similar patterns of shape covariation at
both interspecific and intraspecific levels (Klingenberg, 2014). This will allow to emphasize how body
mass could influence the structure of the limb long bones among rhinos.

Material and Methods
          Studied sample
The dataset was composed of 50 complete skeletons housed in different European and American mu-
seums and belonging to the five extant rhino species: Ceratotherium simum (15 specimens), Dicerorhi-
nus sumatrensis (9 specimens), Diceros bicornis (10 specimens), Rhinoceros sondaicus (7 specimens)
and Rhinoceros unicornis (9 specimens) (Table 9). Some specimens are the same as considered in Chap-
ter 3. The sample involved males, females and specimens without sex information, as well as captive
and wild specimens. All anatomical terms are the same as used in Chapter 3.

          3D geometric morphometrics
I used the same number and position for anatomical landmarks and curve sliding semi-landmarks than
in the protocol described in Chapter 3 but the number of surface sliding semi-landmarks was reduced
for all the bones – except the fibula – to improve the computation duration (see Appendix 1 of this
chapter). The specimen C. simum RMCA 1985.32-M-0001 was chosen to be the initial specimen on
which all anatomical landmarks, curve and surface sliding semi-landmarks were placed as in Chapter
3.

          Study of morphological integration
I explored fifteen covariation patterns among all the possible pairs of bones (Gasc, 2001; Schmidt &
Fischer, 2009): within-limbs adjacent bones (humerus-radius, humerus-ulna, radius-ulna, femur-tibia,
femur-fibula and tibia-fibula), serially homologous bones (humerus-femur, radius-tibia, radius-fibula,
ulna-tibia and ulna-fibula) and functionally analogous bones (humerus-tibia, humerus-fibula) (Figure
17). If the serial homology for the stylopodial bones seems obvious, no clear consensus exists for the
serial homology within the zeugopodium elements. Many studies consider the radius and the tibia,
and the ulna and the fibula, as serially homologous respectively (Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007; Schmidt
& Fischer, 2009; Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Hanot et al., 2017; Botton-Divet et al., 2018), unfortunately
without strong developmental or genetic evidences. Recent studies tend to indicate that the appar-
ently obvious homology between fore and hind limb segments might be much more spurious than
previously thought (Diogo & Molnar, 2014; Sears, Capellini & Diogo, 2015). In this context, I therefore
tested the four possible bone combinations in the zeugopodium. As the appendicular skeleton is
known to be highly integrated among quadrupedal mammals (Schmidt & Fischer, 2009; Martín‐Serra
et al., 2015; Hanot et al., 2017; Botton-Divet et al., 2018), I also tested the combinations involving non-
homologous or analogous bones (radius-femur and ulna-femur) (Figure 17). Covariation patterns were
investigated using Two-Blocks Partial Least Squares (2BPLS) analyses. The 2BPLS method extracts the

principal axes of covariation from a covariance matrix computed on two shape datasets (Rohlf & Corti,
2000; Hanot et al., 2018; Botton-Divet et al., 2018), allowing to visualise the specimen repartition rel-
atively to these axes and the shape changes associated.

Each PLS axis is characterized notably by its explained percentage of the overall covariation, its PLS
correlation coefficient (rPLS) and its p-value, computed as a singular warp analysis as detailed in Book-
stein et al. (2003). The p-value was considered as significant when the observed rPLS was higher than
the ones obtained from randomly permuted blocks (1000 permutations). When the p-value was below
0.05, the PLS was considered as significant, i.e. the two considered blocks as significantly integrated. I
used the function “pls2b” in the “Morpho” package to compute the 2BPLS (Schlager, 2017). To visualise
these shape changes along the PLS axes, I used the function “plsCoVar” in the “Morpho” package to
compute theoretical shapes at two standard deviations on each side of each axis (see Schlager, 2017).
These theoretical conformations were then used to calculate a TPS deformation of the template mesh
and therefore visualise the shape changes along the PLS axes. I then used the function “meshDist” in
the “Morpho” package to create colour maps indicating the location and the intensity of the covaria-
tion between two meshes by mapping the distance between the minimum and maximum theoretical
shapes along he first PLS axis (i.e. areas in red are the ones showing the most of shape changes within
a bone pair whereas the areas in blue are the ones showing the less of shape change).

This procedure was performed at an interspecific level including all the 50 specimens into a single GPA.
I also explored the intraspecific level of covariation by performing the sliding and GPA procedures on
subsamples containing each different species. I then obtained five specific datasets on which were
performed 2BPLS analyses.

         Effect of the allometry
It has been previously demonstrated that centroid size may be a good approximation of the body mass
of the specimen (Ercoli & Prevosti, 2011; Cassini, Vizcaíno & Bargo, 2012), notably among modern
rhinos (see Chapter 3). To assess the effect of body mass on integration patterns – i.e. the effect of
evolutionary allometry – I computed a multivariate regression of the shape against the centroid size
using the function “procD.lm” in the “geomorph” package (v3.1.2—Adams & Otárola‐Castillo, 2013).
Then the residuals were used to compute allometry-free shapes, which were analysed with 2BPLS as
described previously. Each species may have its own allometric slope, making it difficult to remove the
general allometry effect (Klingenberg, 2016). However, considering the results obtained on Chapter 3
indicating close allometric slopes for the different species and the reduced sample size inherent to
studying this endangered group, I chose to provide allometry-free shapes considering a single allome-
tric component among all species (evolutionary allometry).

          Statistical corrections for multiple comparisons
As explained above, I performed multiple pairwise comparisons when computing the different PLS.
Each analysis tested a different pair of bones and contained part of the data present in some other
analyses (e.g., landmarks of the humerus are tested for covariation with those of the radius, but also
in all other pairs involving the humerus). For each tested pair, the hypothesis was that of a significant
covariation between the shapes of the two bones. Given these settings and the exploratory approach
of the study, there is no common agreement in the literature regarding whether or not statistical cor-
rections for multiple comparisons should be used in the present case in order to lower the risk of find-
ing false positives (i.e. finding a significant result due to chance) (Cabin & Mitchell, 2000; Streiner &
Norman, 2011). In this context, I chose to present and discuss both uncorrected and corrected analyses
for multiple comparisons, especially for the analyses at the intraspecific level where the correction had
a higher impact (see Results). I applied a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to my data (Benjamini &
Hochberg, 1995) as described by Randau & Goswami (2018) in a similar context of covariation tests on
3D geometric morphometric data. The test was run in R using the function “p.adjust” in the “stats”
package. This correction was applied to all tests at the interspecific and intraspecific levels.

Results
          Covariation at the interspecific level
All the first PLS axes are highly significant (p-values < 0.01 after correction – see Figures 18 and 19).
These first axes gather between 53% (tibia-fibula) and 90% (humerus-femur) of the total covariation.
Similarly, the rPLS values are high and vary between 0.72 (tibia-fibula) and 0.94 (humerus-ulna), indi-
cating a strong general integration of the limb bones (Figure 20A). Intra-limb bones covary slightly
more strongly in the forelimb than in the hind limb (Figure 20A). Surprisingly, the humerus and the
ulna covary slightly more together (rPLS = 0.94) than the radius-ulna pair (rPLS = 0.93). In the hind limb,
despite a high degree of covariation between the femur and the tibia (rPLS = 0.89), these two bones
are poorly integrated with the fibula. When looking at serially homologous bones, the integration ap-
pears stronger between the humerus and the femur (rPLS = 0.93) and the ulna and the tibia (rPLS =
0.92) than between the radius and the tibia (rPLS = 0.88) and the ulna and the fibula (rPLS = 0.82). The
radius-fibula covariation is the weakest (rPLS = 0.76) of all serially homologous bones. Regarding the
functionally analogous bones, the covariation between the humerus and the hind limb zeugopodial
bones is strong and more marked with the tibia (rPLS = 0.92) than with the fibula (rPLS = 0.84). Finally,
the non-homologous or functionally analogous bones reveal also a stronger covariation between the
ulna and the femur (rPLS = 0.90) than between the radius and the femur (rPLS = 0.84). In summary, all
categories of pairwise comparisons (intra-limb, serial homology, functional analogy, non-homologous
or analogous bones) showed high but unequal degrees of covariation. The fibula particularly stands
out as having relatively weak degrees of covariations with other bones, being the only one not showing
at least one very high covariation with another bone.

All plots of the first PLS axes are structured by an opposition between Ds. sumatrensis in the negative
side and C. simum in the positive side (Figures 18 and 19), except for the tibia-fibula pair. Diceros bi-
cornis, R. sondaicus and R. unicornis generally plot between these two extremes. All PLS plots involving
the humerus display a clear isolation of these three taxa around null values and poorly dispersed clus-
ters (Figure 18A-E). The clusters along the first PLS axis appear structured by a distinction between
Asiatic and African taxa (less marked for the humerus-radius [Figure 18A] and the humerus-ulna [Figure
18E] couples) which can reflect an effect of the phylogeny (if considering African and Asiatic groups as
sister taxa). This separation between African and Asiatic taxa follows the distribution of body mass
within those groups, the lightest species showing the most negative values and the heaviest ones the
most positive ones within both geographic groups. For all the bone pairs not involving the humerus,
specimens within each species are more widely distributed in the morphospace and are organized
differently along the first PLS axis. The radius-ulna first axis clearly expresses a sorting of the species
from the lightest (Ds. sumatrensis) on the negative side to the heaviest (C. simum) on the positive side

(Figure 18F) independently of the phylogenetic affinities between species. Although less clear, this
structure also occurs for the radius-femur, radius-fibula, ulna-femur, ulna-fibula and femur-tibia pairs
(Figure 18G and Figure 19B, C, E, F). Dicerorhinus sumatrensis is strongly isolated on the negative side
on all pairs involving the femur (Figure 18C, G and Figure 19C, F, G). A third pattern isolating Ds. suma-
trensis and Dc. bicornis on the negative part from the three other species on the positive part can be
observed for the radius-tibia and ulna-tibia pairs (Figure 19A, D). The only first PLS axis showing a
clearly different pattern is that of the tibia-fibula pair, where R. sondaicus is the most extreme species
on the positive part and C. simum and R. unicornis clusters overlap (Figure 19H).

The second PLS axes are significant in most of the cases, except for the humerus-radius and humerus-
femur pairs (p-values > 0.05 – see Appendix 2 of this chapter). These second axes explain between 4%
(humerus-femur) and 31% (ulna-tibia) of the global covariation. Most of the PLS plots indicate a sepa-
ration between the genus Rhinoceros and the three other rhino species, with an important overlapping
of the clusters in many cases (see Appendix 2 of this chapter). This distinction is however absent for
most of the plots involving the fibula, where the genus Rhinoceros may overlap the D. or D. clusters.
No clear intraspecific pattern linked to age or sex has been found along these second PLS axes.

Colour maps computed using the theoretical shapes (available in Appendix 3 of this chapter) indicate
that covariation associated to the first PLS axes are very similar for each bone regardless of the con-
sidered pair. Eight pairs representing the four types of relation existing between bones are presented
in Figures 21 and 22. All other pairs are available in Appendix 4 of this chapter. The shape changes are
mainly related to an increase of the bone robustness from negative to positive values of the axes,
associated to a development of most of the muscular insertions (tubercles and trochanters) and of
articular surfaces. For the humerus, most of the shape covariation with the other bones is located on
muscular insertion areas, such as the lesser tubercle, the deltoid tuberosity, the lesser tubercle con-
vexity and the epicondylar crest, where insert respectively the m. supraspinatus, the m. deltoideus, the
m. subscapularis and the m. extensor carpi radialis (Figure 21A, D). The intensity of the covariation of
the deltoid tuberosity is higher with the radius than with all other bones. For the radius, the strongest
shape covariation with the other bones is located on the lateral insertion relief where inserts the m.
extensor digitorum communis, on the medial part of the distal epiphysis and, to a lesser extent, on the
radial tuberosity where inserts the m. biceps brachii (Figure 21B and 22A). On the medial part of the
distal epiphysis, the shape covariation is less intense in the humerus-radius and radius-fibula couples
than in the other bone pairs. For the ulna, the shape covariation with the other bones is mainly located
on the medial and lateral tuberosities of the olecranon (where insert respectively the medial and lat-
eral heads of the m. triceps brachii) and along the lateral and palmar edges of the shaft, where insert
most of the digit extensors (Figure 21C, 22A and 22D). The shape covariation is slightly more pro-
nounced on the olecranon tuberosity in the radius-ulna pair than in the other pairs. The femur is the
bone showing the most similar patterns of shape covariation regardless of the bone pair. The strongest
shape covariation with all other bones is located on the third tubercle and corresponds to the insertion
of the m. gluteus superficialis. Other strong shape covariations between the femur and the other bones
are located on the greater trochanter convexity where inserts the m. gluteus accessorius, and from the
fovea capitis to the lesser tubercle where insert both the mm. psoas major and iliacus as well as the
joint capsule of the hip (Figure 21A, 22B and 22D). Unlike the femur, the patterns of shape covariation
for the tibia are highly variable depending of the considered bone pair. For the radius-tibia and the

ulna-tibia pairs, the strongest shape covariation is mainly located on the tibial tuberosity (where insert
notably the medial, intermediate and lateral patellar ligaments, the patellar fascia and the fascia lata),
the tibial crest, the area located distally to the medial condyle of the tibia where inserts the m. pop-
liteus, and on the cranial and caudal sides of the distal part of the shaft (Figure 21B). The shape covari-
ation is located in the same areas but with less intensity for the femur-tibia and tibia-fibula pairs (Figure
22B, C). The intensity of the shape covariation is minimal for the humerus-tibia pair, except for the
insertion of the m. popliteus (Figure 21D). Finally, for the fibula, the shape covariation with the other
bones is mainly located on the cranial part of the head of the fibula, on the distal part of the cranial

            Allometry-free covariation
All the first PLS axes computed on allometry-free shapes are highly significant (p-values after correction
< 0.01 – see Figures 23 and 24). The first PLS axes explain between 44% (ulna-fibula) and 87% (hu-
merus-femur) of the total covariation. The rPLS values remain high and range between 0.70 (humerus-

radius) and 0.91 (humerus-femur). The rPLS values are unequally impacted by the correction for allom-
etry depending on the considered bone pair. A drop of 12 – 16% of the rPLS values can be observed
between raw and allometry-free shapes for some couples: two intra-limbs pairs (humerus-radius, hu-
merus-ulna) and two non-homologous or functionally analogous bones (radius-femur and ulna-femur)
(Figure 20B). The drop of the rPLS values is less marked for other pairs and almost inexistent in the
humerus-femur, humerus-fibula and ulna-fibula couples. Moreover, the rPLS value is strictly the same
for the radius-fibula pair. I also noticed a slight rise of the rPLS value for the femur-fibula and tibia-
fibula pairs by 6% and 1% respectively.

However, the distribution of the different species and specimens along the first PLS axes is different
from the previous analyses (Figures 18 and 19) when computed on allometry-free shapes (Figures 23
and 24). All plots involving the humerus are structured in the same way with a strong separation be-
tween the three Asiatic species on the negative side and the two African species on the positive side
(Figure 23A-E). A relatively similar structure is observed for the ulna-femur plot (Figure 24C) but the
patterning of the distribution for all other bone pairs distributions is far less clear. Plots for the radius-
ulna and the radius-tibia pairs display a similar pattern with Dc. bicornis and Ds. sumatrensis grouped
together on the negative side, and the three other species on the positive side (Figure 23F and Figure
24A) despite some overlaps. Other plots display various patterns not distinguishing the species based
on either size, geography or phylogenetic relationships. An opposition between R. unicornis and C.
simum is also visible at the positive and negative parts of the first axis respectively with Ds. sumatrensis
and Dc. bicornis overlapping around null values for the ulna-fibula pair (Figure 24E), or a slight distinc-
tion between the Rhinoceros genus and the other species for the ulna-tibia pair, whereas Dc. bicornis
and R. sondaicus are strictly opposed along the first PLS axis (Figure 24D). A separation between R.
sondaicus and the other species is also clearly visible for the tibia-fibula pair (Figure 24H). As for the
raw data, the allometry-free shape changes along the first PLS axes mainly concern the robustness of
the bones and shape covariation is very similar for all the bones regardless of the considered pair. All
allometry-free theoretical shapes are available in Appendix 5 of this chapter.

At the intraspecific level, rPLS values are relatively high but few first PLS axes are statistically significant,
even before correction (Table 10). Analyses reveal that the first PLS axis is significant for five bone pairs
within C. simum (humerus-radius, humerus-ulna, humerus-femur, radius-femur and ulna-femur) and
R. sondaicus (humerus-radius, radius-tibia, radius-fibula, humerus-tibia and ulna-femur), three for R.
unicornis (humerus-ulna, tibia-fibula and ulna-tibia), two for Ds. sumatrensis (humerus-femur and hu-
merus-tibia) and only one for Dc. bicornis (ulna-tibia). The rPLS values are extremely high (from 0.89

to 0.99) for R. sondaicus relatively to the other species (0.72 - 0.94 for C. simum, 0.66 - 0.96 for Ds.
sumatrensis, 0.76 - 0.96 for Dc. bicornis and 0.79 - 0.97 for R. unicornis). Although the covariation of
some pairs may be common to some taxa (e. g. humerus-radius and ulna-femur for C. simum and R.
sondaicus, humerus-tibia for Ds. sumatrensis and R. sondaicus), each species displays an overall differ-
ent pattern of covariation. The observed lacks of significance may be due to the small number of spec-
imens per species. However, C. simum and R. sondaicus show the highest percentage of significant
results and are respectively represented by 15 and 7 specimens, these two subsamples being not par-
ticularly more diverse than the other species (adults and subadults, males and females, wild and cap-
tive specimens – see Appendix 6 of this chapter). This indicates that the observed tendency is not only
related to the sample size but may also carry some biological signal. Moreover, some bone pairs show
a p-value between 0.05 and 0.1 associated with a high rPLS value. This is notably the case for the tibia-
fibula pair in the two Rhinoceros species (Table 10). This tends to indicate that the shape covariation
between the fibula and the tibia may be higher for this clade than for other rhino species. In addition,
the rPLS values of other pairs involving the fibula are often higher in both species of Rhinoceros than
in other species in the sample, although their covariation is rarely significant.

For all these pairs, shape covariation involves anatomical areas which are similar within each species
but often different between species (see Appendix 7 of this chapter). However, some anatomical areas
appear to show high shape covariation both at the interspecific and intraspecific levels. This is notably
the case of the greater tubercle convexity and the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus and the olecranon
tuberosity of the ulna. These areas correspond to the insertion of powerful muscles for flexion and
extension of the forearm (respectively the m. infraspinatus, the m. deltoideus and the m. triceps bra-
chii).

             After Benjamini-Hochberg correction

After the Benjamini-Hochberg correction of the p-values, rPLS values remain statistically significant for
only four bone pairs, all belonging to C. simum, which is the species with the highest number of speci-
mens (Table 10). In this species, the covariation is extremely strong for the humerus-radius (rPLS =
0.92), the humerus-femur (rPLS = 0.93) and the ulna-femur (rPLS = 0.94) pairs, and slightly weaker for
the radius-femur pair (rPLS = 0.89). When looking at the first PLS axes for these four bone pairs, it
appears clearly that the subadults are separated from the adults, sometimes without overlap, as for
the ulna-femur pair (Figure 25). Contrary to the age class, the size of the individuals (expressed by the
sum of the centroid sizes of the two bones in each case) does not seem to follow a precise pattern
along the first PLS axes for these four bone pairs (Figure 25). A slight distinction between males and

females observed along the first PLS axes may partly account for the sexual dimorphism that exists in
this species (Groves, 1972; Guérin, 1980). However, data are not sufficient to state on a potential dif-
ference of integration level due to sexual dimorphism in C. simum.

Although not statistically significant before and after correction, similar distinctions between adults
and subadults have been observed on the first PLS axes for Dc. bicornis for some bone pairs (mainly
humerus-radius, humerus-ulna, humerus-femur, humerus-tibia and radius-femur). Details on age class
are too often missing for the three Asiatic species to state on this aspect. Shape variation associated
to the first PLS axes in the significant covariations after correction in C. simum show a different ten-
dency than at the interspecific level. The increase in robustness mainly concerns the shaft of the bone,
both epiphyses tending to be already very large in subadults. This is particularly the case for the

 a high deformation intensity). The colour code of the squares expresses the type of relation between bones as described in
 the Figure 1 (black: intra-limb relation; orange: serial homology; green: non-homologous or analogous bones). a: humerus-

humerus and the femur (Figure 26). Colour maps confirm that the shape covariation along the first PLS
axes for C. simum concerns different areas than at the interspecific level, with a different intensity
depending on the bone pairs (Figure 26). It appears that the cranial side of the femur covaries strongly
with the humerus and the radius, but visibly less with the ulna (Figure 26B, C and D). However, some
anatomical areas are similarly affected by shape covariation both at the intra- and interspecific levels.
This is notably the case for the lesser tubercle tuberosity on the humerus (insertion of the m. subscap-
ularis) (Figure 26A and B) and the greater trochanter convexity on the femur (insertion of the m. glu-
teus accessorius) (Figure 26B and C).

Discussion
          Patterns of evolutionary integration
My results indicate that the limb long bones of modern rhino species are strongly integrated at the
interspecific level, confirming the first a priori hypothesis. This tendency has been previously observed
on limb bones among other terrestrial mammal groups, notably in equids (Hanot et al., 2017, 2018,
2019), but also in more phylogenetically distant and older clades such as carnivorans (Fabre et al.,
2014b; Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Botton-Divet et al., 2018) and marsupials (Martín-Serra & Benson,
2019). The high shape covariation between functionally analogous bones (humerus-tibia) as well as
between non-analogous bones (ulna-femur) tends to indicate that this strong general integration may
be related to a highly coordinated locomotion, as observed in equids at the interspecific level (Hanot
et al., 2017), which is coherent with the rhino ability to gallop (Alexander & Pond, 1992) and to reach
high running speed (Blanco, Gambini & Fariña, 2003).

However, contrary to the second hypothesis, this integration is unequally distributed among the tested
pairs of bones. The within-limb integration is slightly stronger in the forelimb than in the hind limb,
whereas in other taxa, the morphological integration is generally higher in the hind limb (Martín‐Serra
et al., 2015; Hanot et al., 2017; Botton-Divet et al., 2018). The covariation is maximal for the humerus-
ulna and the radius-ulna couples. Although the femur and the tibia display a strong covariation with
one another, the fibula appears as the bone showing the lowest integration level. This is consistent
with the observations described in Chapter 3 on morphological variation of rhino long bones, highlight-
ing that the shape of the fibula is highly variable at the intraspecific level (Mallet et al., 2019). There-
fore, the apparent lower integration of the hind limb may be mainly due to the independent shape
variation of the fibula. The fibula appears nevertheless to be more strongly integrated with the hu-
merus (functionally analogous) and the ulna (serially homologous) than with other hind limb bones.
This confirms that the shape of the fibula remains covariant with other bones beyond stochastic vari-
ation, potentially driving the slightly lower integration of the hind limb than of the forelimb.

          Body mass and evolutionary integration
             Within limbs

Among modern rhinos, most of the shape covariation is mainly driven by an increase in general robust-
ness and in the size of the articular surfaces and muscular insertion areas. This is coherent with previ-
ous observations on other quadrupedal mammals (Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Hanot et al., 2018; Bot-
ton-Divet et al., 2018). The correction for allometry affects both the rhino species distribution along
the PLS axes and the rPLS values in a stronger way than for equids (Hanot et al., 2018), carnivorans
(Martín‐Serra et al., 2015) or musteloids (Botton-Divet et al., 2018) at the interspecific level, confirming

the third hypothesis specifying that body mass has a stronger influence on the degree of integration
among heavy quadrupedal than in lighter mammal species. Allometry is also clearly more pronounced
on the forelimb than on the hind limb, as shown by the drastic reduction of the integration intensity
when using the allometry-free shapes. This tends to indicate that beyond the strong general integra-
tion of the rhino limb bones, the overall higher integration within the forelimb might be caused by a
stronger allometry in these bones – and thus more strongly affected by body mass (Ercoli & Prevosti,
2011; Cassini, Vizcaíno & Bargo, 2012; Mallet et al., 2019) – than the hind limb. Heavy quadrupeds bear
a larger part of the body weight on their forelimbs than on their hind limbs (Hildebrand, 1974) and
rhinos follow this body plan (Regnault et al., 2013) due to their heavy head and horns and their massive
trunk muscles and bones. Previous observations (Schmidt & Fischer, 2009; Hanot et al., 2018) led to
the conclusion that body mass can contribute to covariation between bones, which data seem to con-
firm for rhinos. The higher integration of the forelimb may thus be interpreted as a specialization linked
to weight bearing (Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Randau & Goswami, 2018).

Furthermore, the covariation of the different elements composing the forelimb is probably related to
a complementary effect of phylogenetic relationships, developmental constraints and body mass. The
shape covariation between the humerus and the zeugopodium elements in the forelimb is clearly
driven by a distinction between Asiatic and African species, associated with a sorting linked to the
mean body mass within these two groups. The covariation is particularly strong between the humerus
and the ulna, and although it seems to be largely patterned by phylogenetic history, this is congruent
with previous studies indicating a high integration level between the bones involved in flexion/exten-
sion movements and body stability (Fabre et al., 2014b). Conversely, the interspecific covariation of
the radius-ulna pair seems intimately linked to the mean body mass of rhino species, with no distinct
link to the phylogenetic pattern. This indicates a likely major impact of mass on the zeugopodium in-
tegration coupled with a common developmental origin (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005; Sears et al.,
2007). These results are also in good agreement with the more important impact of body mass ob-
served on the shape of the radius and ulna than on that of the humerus (see Chapter 3) (Mallet et al.,
2019) and the role of the zeugopodium in the support of the body weight due to the alignment of this
segment with pressure forces (Bertram & Biewener, 1992).

Albeit less obvious, an effect of body mass on the hind limb interspecific integration could also exist,
especially between the femur and the tibia when looking at the species distribution along the first PLS
axis (raw shapes) and the rPLS values for allometry-free shapes. In a similar way than for the forelimb,
these two bones are involved in leg flexion/extension, particularly for propulsion (Hildebrand, 1974;
Lawler, 2008; Biewener & Patek, 2018). Conversely, the degree of integration increases between the
femur and the fibula (and to a lesser extent between the tibia and the fibula) when the allometric

                                                   141


                          Chapter 4 – Morphological integration in modern rhinos


effect is removed, which is a unique phenomenon among all tested limb bone pairs. One interpretation
can be that the allometry effect consists in antagonistic changes between the femur and the fibula,
and that the fibula shape covariation at the interspecific level is poorly related to body mass. This is
coherent with all low rPLS drops for allometry-free shapes in all other pairs involving the fibula. This
difference can also be influenced by a different covariation between the femur and the fibula depend-
ing on the rhino species (see below). The independence of the shape variation of the fibula relatively
to the tibia also indicates that, contrary to the forelimb zeugopodium, neither common developmental
origin nor functional requirements seem to highly constrain the covariation between the two hind limb
zeugopodium bones.

Following the hypotheses of Hallgrímsson et al. (2002) and Young & Hallgrímsson (2005) stating that a
functionally specialized part covaries less with surrounding elements, the fibula could be interpreted
as a highly specialized bone in some rhino species. However, as previously observed for the ulna of
musteloids (Botton-Divet et al., 2018), the lower integration of the fibula may be linked to a decrease
of the functional constraints exerted on this bone. The fibula supports the insertion of digit flexors and
extensors (Barone, 2010a) and is involved in the ankle stability and weight bearing among rhinos. How-
ever the fibula shape has been proven to be poorly correlated with body mass (see Chapter 3) (Mallet
et al., 2019). Therefore, it is likely that the fibula shape varies more independently and is less function-
ally constrained by body mass than other limb bones in some rhino species (see below). This may be
interpreted as a case of parcellation (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005) due to a functional dissociation
between the bones of a single limb.

All the pairs involving the humerus seem thus more strongly impacted by phylogeny than by functional
constraints and, to a lesser extent, by body mass. Most of the other bone pairs rather suggest a domi-
nant effect of body mass, especially the ones involving the radius and the ulna. Although less clear,
similar results are obtained for the hind limb bones.

             Between limbs

At the interspecific level, serially homologous bones are strongly integrated but their covariation is
differently associated with body mass, i.e. more for the zeugopodium elements than for the stylopo-
dium ones. Together with the slightly lower integration values of the zeugopodium elements relatively
to the stylopodium, these observations are also coherent with previous studies indicating a decrease
of the integration from proximal to distal parts of the limbs linked to a higher degree of specialization
of distal elements (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005). In addition, these results are not congruent with the
strict serial homology classically considered for the zeugopodium (radius-tibia and ulna-fibula) by
showing a stronger covariation between the ulna and the tibia than between the radius and the tibia.

                           Chapter 4 – Morphological integration in modern rhinos


Similar results were observed on carnivorans and interpreted as a potential functional convergence
between these bones (Martín‐Serra et al., 2015). These results could also revive doubts on the a priori
hypothesis of homology between zeugopodium bones, which has long been debated (Owen, 1848;
Wyman, 1867; Lessertisseur & Saban, 1967) and, to my knowledge, still remains unresolved although
largely taken for granted (i.e. Bininda-Emonds et al. 2007; Bennett & Goswami 2011; Martín‐Serra et
al. 2015; Botton-Divet et al. 2018). Only a comprehensive study of the genetic processes leading to the
development of forelimb and hind limb zeugopodium could clarify this aspect (Klingenberg, 2014).

The strong integration between the humerus and the tibia (and the fibula to a lesser extent) tends to
confirm the functional analogy between the forelimb stylopodium and the hind limb zeugopodium
(Gasc, 2001; Schmidt & Fischer, 2009). However, the shape covariation is weaker in the humerus-tibia
pair than in other bone pairs involving the tibia (e.g. radius-tibia and ulna-tibia), which tends to indicate
that, in the present case, the functional requirements linked to locomotion and body support during
resting time may less affect the shape covariation than the developmental constraints, contrary to
what has been observed in lighter taxa (Fabre et al., 2014b; Hanot et al., 2017; Botton-Divet et al.,
2018). Moreover, the high covariation between the ulna and the femur also tackles the classic func-
tional approach, highlighting a strong integration between non-homologous or analogous bones, an
observation also recently revealed among marsupials (Martín-Serra & Benson, 2019). Recent work us-
ing a network approach on a phylogenetic matrix of characters among modern and fossil rhinos
showed that unexpected covariations can exist between cranial, dental and postcranial phenotypic
traits in the group (Lord et al., 2019). In particular, the authors observed a frequent co-occurrence of
discrete traits between the radius-ulna and the femur among all rhinos, which seems coherent with
my results indicating a strong covariation between the forelimb zeugopodium and the hind limb stylo-
podium. Since the postcranial body plan appears to be implemented early during the Rhinocerotoidea
evolutionary history (Lord et al., 2019) and may be less variable than in phylogenetically-close taxa like
equids (McHorse, Biewener & Pierce, 2019), this may imply strong inherited developmental constraints
within this group canalizing the shape covariation (Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall, 2002) even between
non-homologous bones. Furthermore, the high integration of non-homologous or analogous bones
appears as strongly congruent with the variation in body mass, lending further support to the link be-
tween heavy weight and high general integration level (Schmidt & Fischer, 2009; Hanot et al., 2017).

          Covariation at the intraspecific level: developmental integration
This exploration of integration patterns at the intraspecific level is limited by the low sample size for
all species and the non-significance (at p>0.05) of most of the PLS axes obtained for the different pairs
of bones, particularly after the Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Beyond this strict non-significance
(which is currently criticized in favour of a more continuous approach of the p-value – see Ho et al.

                                                    143


                           Chapter 4 – Morphological integration in modern rhinos


2019; Wasserstein et al. 2019), no clear similar pattern of integration seems to emerge between light
and heavy rhino species, or between African and Asiatic species. Some species share the same signifi-
cant or almost significant bone pairs. The covariation between the tibia and the fibula among Rhinoc-
eros notably seems relatively strong as compared to in other species, confirming the results obtained
on individual shape variation in Chapter 3. This aspect may indicate that the hind limb zeugopodium –
and particularly the fibula – is less variable among the two species of this genus, with a lesser parcel-
lation among this group.

The integration patterns found in C. simum, the species with the most specimens, reveal both similar-
ities and divergences with the patterns observed at the interspecific level (i.e. evolutionary integration,
see Cheverud 1996; Klingenberg 2014). All the significant PLS axes in this species concern forelimb
bones and indicate a very strong integration between the humerus, the radius and the ulna, as well as
a high shape covariation between the humerus and the femur (serial homology). The strong integration
of the forelimb may be partly related to the heavier and longer head of C. simum compared to other
species (Guérin, 1980) and highlights different patterns of distribution of body weight among modern
rhinos (Antoine, pers. comm. 2020). The shape covariation among C. simum specimens reveals a strong
effect of age with a clear separation between adults and subadults in all cases. Even if this effect is not
visible at the interspecific level, the separation between the two age classes is the main driver of the
integration within this species, whereas body mass (approximately expressed through the value of the
centroid size) and sex do not seem to play a visible role on the covariation patterns. This tendency is
associated with a shape covariation on anatomical areas often different to the ones showing a strong
covariation at the interspecific level. Only the greater tubercle convexity and the deltoid tuberosity on
the humerus, the olecranon tuberosity on the ulna and the greater trochanter convexity on the femur
show a high degree of shape covariance both at both interspecific and intraspecific levels.

Within C. simum, developmental integration is more related to proportions between the different
bone parts (e.g. shaft and epiphyses) than to the development of powerful muscular insertions ensur-
ing the stability and the locomotion of the body. In the end, the global integration of the rhino limb
long bones results in the superposition and association of the different levels of integration (here, de-
velopmental and evolutionary). These integration levels are conjointly influenced by shared phyloge-
netic history, similar developmental origin and constraints due to both locomotion and body mass
support (Cheverud, 1996; Hallgrímsson et al., 2009; Klingenberg, 2014). Investigated here among C.
simum, the static and developmental integration levels remain to be explored with a larger sample for
the other rhino species – which remains challenging for these endangered species. Finally, the addition
of some of the numerous fossil taxa belonging to the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea and displaying

Conclusion
This exploration of the integration patterns of the limb long bones among modern rhinos reveals that
the appendicular skeleton of these species is strongly integrated, as in other terrestrial quadrupedal
mammals. At the interspecific level, the forelimb appears as more covariant than the hind limb, with
a more apparent relation to body mass, which appears stronger than for more lightly built terrestrial
mammals. This can be interpreted as a higher degree of specialization of the forelimb in body weight
support. Proximal elements appear primarily affected by common developmental constraints whereas
the distal parts of the limbs seem rather shaped by functional requirements, which would confirm
hypotheses addressed on different mammal groups. The appendicular skeleton of rhinos appears to
be a compromise between the functional requirements of a highly coordinated locomotion, the neces-
sity to sustain a high body mass and important inherited developmental processes constraining shape
covariation – located mostly on insertion areas for powerful flexor and extensor muscles. In addition,
the exploration of the shape covariation at the intraspecific level reveals a prominent effect of the age
class in shaping the covariation patterns among C. simum. These results are a first step to explore
further the functional construction of the appendicular skeleton of modern rhinos and to extend this
approach to other heavy modern taxa (such as elephants or hippos). Moreover, the numerous fossil
taxa composing the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea and showing a broad range of body mass would be
a valuable group to extend these results and highlight convergent patterns of shape covariation di-
rectly linked to a heavy weight.

Introduction
The two previous chapters explored the shape variation and covariation of the limb bones in the five
modern species of rhinos and their relation with body mass and phylogeny. These investigations clearly
highlight a link between mass and shape, with noticeable differences between fore and hind limbs, as
well as between stylopodium and zeugopodium elements. However, these five species only represent
a very small and homogenous sample of the past diversity of the superfamily. Moreover, it is likely that
the occurrences of high body mass in modern rhinos are not independent as these species are closely
related (the highest body mass in extant rhinos only represent two independent events in C. simum
and R. unicornis). That is why I extended this investigation to other members of the superfamily, in
order to take into account several independent occurrences of high body mass and a large diversity of
body construction.

The Rhinocerotoidea was a flourishing superfamily during the Cenozoic. A rich and well-preserved fos-
sil record led to the description of more than a hundred species distributed in Eurasia, North America
and Africa, showing a huge diversity of ecological niches and locomotor conditions (Prothero & Schoch,
1989; Cerdeño, 1998; Prothero, 2005; Biasatti, Wang & Deng, 2018). Rhinocerotoidea ranged from less
than 100 kg in Hyrachyus, the most ancient representative of the superfamily (Antoine, 2002; Bai et
al., 2017), to more than 10 tons in giant Paraceratheriidae (Fortelius & Kappelman, 1993; Prothero,
1998a; Qiu & Wang, 2007; Prothero, 2013) (Table 11). Between these two extremes, numerous line-
ages showed convergent increases in body mass, with many species exceeding 1 ton or more (Cerdeño,
1998). In addition to this variation in body mass, the evolutionary history of rhinocerotoids exhibit
fluctuations in their general body plan (from cursorial to graviportal), their degree of brachypody (or
gracility, i.e. reduction of their relative limb length), their ecological affinities (from open environments
to presumed semi-aquatic lifestyles), their number of forelimb digits (tetradactyl or tridactyl manus),
the presence of horns and the size of their head, all of which may also have covaried with the shape of
long bones (Guérin, 1989; Prothero & Schoch, 1989; Prothero, 1998a; Cerdeño, 1998; Antoine, 2002;
Becker, 2003; Prothero, 2005; Becker et al., 2009; Prothero, 2013; Bai et al., 2017).

Consequently, members of the superfamily represent a rich diversity of body mass, size and propor-
tions and constitute a great example for exploring how the evolution of long bone shape in the group
could be associated with these parameters. A few studies previously investigated the shape variation
of the limb bones in either modern or fossil rhinocerotoids, but rarely in regards to mass, size or degree
of brachypody / gracility (Guérin, 1980; Prothero & Sereno, 1982; Becker, 2003; Mallet et al., 2019;
Etienne et al., 2020; Mallet et al., 2020). To date, no comprehensive morphofunctional analysis has

                     Chapter 5 – Shape variation of forelimb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


explored covariation patterns between the shape of the long bones and each of these parameters at
the scale of the entire superfamily.

In this chapter, I investigated the shape variation of the forelimb bones among the superfamily Rhino-
cerotoidea in relation with bone size, body mass and degree of gracility. I performed phylogenetically-
informed shape analyses of the three forelimb bones (humerus, radius, ulna) in a 3D geometric mor-
phometric context. I chose to focus on forelimb bones because they play a crucial role in supporting
the body weight and in braking during locomotion in quadrupeds (Hildebrand, 1974; Dutto et al., 2006;
Henderson, 2006). Moreover, the results obtained in Chapters 3 and 4 on modern rhinos indicate a
greater association of both mass and size with the shape of the forelimb bones over that of the hind
limb ones (Mallet et al., 2019, 2020). In accordance with literature, I hypothesize: (a) a strong associa-
tion of bone size, body mass, and degree of gracility with bone shape; (b) different expression of this
association on the stylopodium and zeugopodium respectively (Alexander et al., 1979; Prothero &
Sereno, 1982; Biewener, 1989b; Bertram & Biewener, 1992; Mallet et al., 2019, 2020); (c) a marked
influence of the evolutionary legacy on shape variation, with differences depending on the considered
bone.

Material and Methods
         Studied sample
I selected 283 modern and fossil specimens housed in fifteen institutions and representing a total of
94 humeri, 105 radii and 84 ulnae (see Appendix 1 of this chapter for the complete list of studied
specimens). The dataset included 69 taxa (5 modern and 64 fossil species) belonging to almost all fam-
ilies of the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea (no representative of the family Eggysodontidae were in-
cluded) (Figure 27). Taxa were selected to include as much body shape and mass diversity as possible
and to cover the largest temporal range but this selection also depended much on the available mate-
rial. Taxonomic attributions were verified or updated using recent literature, directly with specimen
numbers when available, or using taxonomic lists and institution databases for each locality. I retained
the most recent binomial names considered as correct following the International Commission on Zo-
ological Nomenclature rules (see Appendix 1 of this chapter).

I only considered adult individuals with fully fused epiphyses. I chose complete bones displaying no or
negligible taphonomic effects (e.g. shallow surface cracks not altering the global shape), rejecting spec-
imens massively crushed or restored with plaster. I also considered uncomplete bones in partial shape
analyses (see below), as long as they were not crushed or distorted. Almost no information regarding
sex was available for fossil specimens: even if sexual dimorphism is known for some species and may
slightly affect the shape of long bones (Guérin, 1980; Dinerstein, 1991; Mead, 2000; Zschokke & Baur,
2002; Mihlbachler, 2007; Chen et al., 2010), I assumed that this intraspecific variation was largely ex-
ceeded by interspecific shape changes (according to Mallet et al., 2019). For each species, I selected
between up to three specimens for each bone. All anatomical terms are as described in Chapter 3.

         3D models
Scanning process was achieved as described in Chapter 2. As a few specimens displayed small lacking
parts on the shaft, I used Geomagic Studio (v2014.3.0.1781—3D Systems Corporation, 2014) to fill
holes. I used the “curvature filling” tool to ensure that the added polygons matched the curvature of
the surrounding mesh.

         3D geometric morphometrics
The geometric location of landmarks and semi-landmarks is derived from those used in Chapter 3 to
cover the shape diversity of the sample (see Appendix 2 of this chapter for details on landmark num-
bers and locations). Two specimens (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis NHMUK ZE 1948.12.20.1 for the hu-
merus and the ulna, and Ceratotherium simum RMCA 1985.32-M-0001 for the radius) were chosen to
be the initial specimens on which all anatomical landmarks, curve and surface sliding semi-landmarks

were placed. I selected these two individuals for their average shape and size ensuring that all points
will be correctly projected on other bones despite the great shape and size ranges of the sample.

As I chose to work at the species level, I then computed and analysed species mean shapes (Botton-
Divet et al., 2017; Serio, Raia & Meloro, 2020). After the sliding step, I computed a first Generalized
Procrustes Analysis (GPA) with all specimens to remove the effect of size, location and orientation of
the different landmark conformations (Gower, 1975; Rohlf & Slice, 1990). Then I computed the Pro-
crustes consensus (or mean shape) of each species. A second GPA was then computed on species
means. This process was repeated for each bone separately. As my dataset contained more variables
than observations, I computed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality (Gunz
& Mitteroecker, 2013) and visualize the distribution of the species in the morphospace. I also com-
puted theoretical shapes associated with both minimum and maximum of the first two components of
PCAs using a Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) deformation of a template mesh. Phylogenetic relationships be-
tween taxa (see below) were then plotted in the morphospace and compared to Neighbour Joining
(NJ) trees computed on PC scores. Projection, relaxation, sliding processes, GPAs, PCAs and theoretical
shape computation were conducted using the “Morpho” package (v2.8) in the R environment (v3.5.3—
R Core Team, 2014). Details of the process are provided in the documentation of the package (Schlager,
2017). Phylogeny was plotted on the morphospace using the function “plotGMPhyloMorphoSpace” of
the “geomorph” package (v3.2.1—Adams & Otárola‐Castillo, 2013). NJ trees were computed with the
“ape” package (v5.3—Paradis et al., 2018a).

          Partial analyses
Fossil long bones of rhinoceros can show redundant breakage patterns due to various taphonomic
agents throughout the diagenesis process (e.g. high sedimentary pressure on fragile anatomical areas,
scavenger action on parts containing marrow – see Guérin, 1980). This is notably the case of the prox-
imal part of the humerus or the olecranon process of the ulna, frequently damaged and preventing me
to use some specimens in whole bone shape analyses. In order to include a higher number of relevant
taxa in my sample despite these alterations, I performed partial analyses on bones presenting im-
portant lacking parts. I included complete bones as well in these partial analyses. Following Bardua et
al. (2019), I used curve semi-landmarks to define artificial lines acting as a limit for the sliding of surface
semi-landmarks and virtually remove damaged or lacking parts from analyses. These limit lines in-
volved at least one anatomical landmark to ensure that they were geometrically homologous on all
specimens. They were placed as well on complete bones, which were all included in partial analyses.
Limit lines were finally removed after the sliding process to consider only true biological shape infor-
mation in my analyses. Three partial datasets were used: distal half of the humerus, ulna without

olecranon tubercle and proximal half of the ulna (see Appendix 2 of this chapter for details on land-
marks in partial templates).

          Phylogenetic framework
To date, no comprehensive and consensual phylogeny of the whole superfamily Rhinocerotoidea ex-
ists. To assess the effect of phylogenetic relationships on shape variation, I constructed a composite
cladogram using trees previously computed on cranio-dental and postcranial characters or molecular
data. Branch relations, lengths and occurrence dates were reconstructed after the works of Cerdeño
(1995), Antoine (2002), Antoine et al. (2003, 2010), Prothero (2005), Boada-Saña (2008), Piras et al.
(2010), Becker et al. (2013), Lu (2013), Wang et al. (2016), Averianov et al. (2017), Tissier et al. (2018).
I used the cladistic framework of Antoine et al. (2003) and Becker et al. (2013) to define families, sub-
families, tribes and subtribes (Figure 27). As described in Chapter 3, the relationships between the five
modern taxa remain controversial, especially regarding the position of the Sumatran rhinoceros (Dic-
erorhinus sumatrensis) and its extinct relatives (e.g. Tougard et al., 2001; Orlando et al., 2003; Fer-
nando et al., 2006; Price & Bininda‐Emonds, 2009; Steiner & Ryder, 2011; Yuan et al., 2014; Welker et
al., 2017; Cappellini et al., 2019). It is likely that these uncertainties may be due to a hard polytomy at
the base of the crown-group containing the five modern species (Willerslev et al., 2009; Gaudry, 2017).
I therefore chose to consider a hard polytomy in my analyses and to address phylogenetic uncertainties
using an NNI procedure (see below).

To address the effect of phylogenetic relationships on shape data for each bone, I evaluated their phy-
logenetic signal by computing a multivariate K statistic (Kmult) on PC scores. This index allows the com-
parison between the rate of observed morphological change and that expected under a Brownian mo-
tion on a given phylogeny (Blomberg et al., 2003; Adams, 2014). As the Kmult computation requires fully
bifurcating trees, I removed polytomies using the function “multi2di” in the “ape” package (Paradis et
al., 2018). This function resolves polytomies by randomly creating a new branch with a null length from
one branch of the polytomous node (Swenson, 2014; Paradis et al., 2018). Kmult was then computed
using the function “K.mult” in the “phylocurve” package (Goolsby, 2015).

          Body mass, centroid size and gracility index
I explored the association of three variables related to body proportions and size (body mass, centroid
size of the bone and gracility index) with the shape of each long bone of the forelimb within Rhinoce-
rotoidea. Mean body mass (BM) of each species was retrieved from the literature, compiling up to
three estimations per species to compute mean BMs (see Table 11 and Appendix 3 of this chapter).
However, BM estimations are highly heterogenous and can vary by a factor of three for a single species
depending on the considered method and morphological proxy (dental, cranial or postcranial

measurements), the specimen developmental stage, and the geological formation. Moreover, regres-
sion equations for BM estimation were rarely developed for Perissodactyla or rhinoceroses only, re-
sulting in potentially biased results for fossil Rhinocerotoidea (Prothero & Sereno, 1982). I managed to
collect BM estimation for only 40 over the 69 taxa constituting my sample. Consequently, I chose to
also consider the centroid size (CS) of each bone, which is classically used to address allometric varia-
tion, i.e. the shape variation linked to size (Zelditch et al., 2012; Mitteroecker et al., 2013; Klingenberg,
2016; Hallgrímsson et al., 2019). Centroid size, defined as the square root of the sum of the square of
the distance of each point to the centroid of the landmark set (Zelditch et al., 2012), is known to be a
good proxy of the mass of the animal (Ercoli & Prevosti, 2011; Cassini, Vizcaíno & Bargo, 2012), espe-
cially for limb bones of rhinoceros (Mallet et al., 2019; Etienne et al., 2020). Given the large range of
body shapes within Rhinocerotoidea (Figure 27) and the fact that the same mass can be associated
with both a slender or a robust body condition, I used the mean gracility index (GI-MC3) as an estimator
of the degree of brachypody (see Table 11 and Appendix 3 of this chapter). This index is computed
dividing the transverse width of the third metacarpal by its maximal length and has been much used
for rhinocerotoids (Colbert, 1938; Arambourg, 1959; Guérin, 1980; Cerdeño, 1998; Becker, 2003;
Becker et al., 2009; Scherler et al., 2013). The higher the GI-MC3 value, the shorter the limb length:
species with a high GI-MC3 value are considered as more brachypodial (or less gracile) than species
with low values. I computed this index by measuring third metacarpals when available in collections
or compiling up to three GI-MC3 values in the literature to compute mean GI-MC3. These metacarpals
were mostly associated with long bones for modern species, and mostly associated with a similar lo-
cality for fossil species (Appendix 3 of this chapter). I addressed the effect of phylogeny on log-trans-
formed CS, log-transformed cubic root of the mean BM, and log-transformed mean GI-MC3 using the
univariate K statistic (Blomberg et al., 2003). I tested for correlation between these three variables
respectively using a linear regression on Phylogenetic Independent Contrasts (Felsenstein, 1985). I
used the function “contMap” of the “phytools” package (Revell, 2012) to plot these three variables
along the phylogeny.

Variation patterns, and thus covariation, can be expressed and analysed at different levels: across spe-
cies (evolutionary variation), within a species at a single developmental stage (static variation), within
a species across developmental stages (ontogenetic variation) (Klingenberg, 2014). Here I explored the
evolutionary covariation of bone shape with each of the three variables (BM, CS, GI-MC3) considering
a multivariate approach using Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS), a regression model tak-
ing into account the phylogenetic framework and computed here on Procrustes coordinates to quan-
tify the shape variation related to CS, BM and GI-MC3 (Martins & Hansen, 1997; Rohlf, 2001; Klingen-
berg & Marugán-Lobón, 2013; Adams & Collyer, 2018). This was done using the function “procD.pgls”

of the “geomorph” package (v3.2.1—(Adams & Otárola‐Castillo, 2013), suited for 3D geometric mor-
phometric data. As the phylogeny of Rhinocerotoidea remains debated for both extant and extinct
taxa (see above), I assessed the effect of potential uncertainty in taxa position in the phylogeny on
PGLS by using a Nearest Neighbour Interchange (NNI) procedure. NNI algorithm generates new trees
by swapping two adjacent branches of a specified tree (Felsenstein, 2004). I generated new trees using
the “nni” function of the package “phangorn” (Schliep, 2011) and computed PGLS with these rear-
ranged trees to estimate the ranges of R² and p values.

All statistic tests have been considered as significant for p-values ≤ 0.01. However, given that recent
statistical works call for a continuous approach of the p-value (Wasserstein, Schirm & Lazar, 2019; Ho
et al., 2019), I chose to mention results having a p-value up to 0.05 as well.

Results
          Correlation between BM and GI-MC3
The evolutionary variation of mean BM and mean GI-MC3 both show a significant phylogenetic signal
(KBM = 1.75, p < 0.001; KGI-MC3 = 1.70, p < 0.001) and are significantly correlated with one another when
phylogeny is taken into account (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). The mapping of mean BM and GI-MC3 along the
phylogeny (Figure 28) clearly indicates that, despite this significant correlation, there is not a strict
correspondence between high BM and high GI-MC3 values. This is particularly visible for Paracera-
theriidae, large Elasmotheriinae and Teleoceratina.

          Humerus – complete bone
The species distributions in the NJ tree (Figure 29A) and in the phylomorphospace (Figure 30A) com-
puted on the complete humeri are mostly congruent with phylogeny, which is not surprising since the
phylogenetic signal carried by its shape variation is strong (Kmult = 1.16, p < 0.01). Along the NJ tree,
small-sized and early-diverging Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae are followed by a cluster mixing Rhi-
nocerotidae and Rhinocerotinae incertae sedis (i. s.) with Paramynodon, Urtinotherium, Menoceras,
some Aceratheriini and even Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. Other Aceratheriini are grouped close to Tele-
oceratina and Dihoplus megarhinus, while almost all Rhinocerotina form a well-separated group (Fig-
ure 29A). The phylomorphospace of the first two axes of the PCA, representing 63.7% of the global
variance, is structured in a similar way (Figure 30A). PC1 carries 54% of the variance. Along PC1, Hyra-
chyidae and Hyracodontidae plot towards negative values while Paramynodon is close to a central
cluster grouping Urtinotherium, Menoceras, Aceratheriini, Teleoceratina, as well as Rhinocerotidae
and Rhinocerotinae i. s. Within this cluster, Aphelops shares a shape proximity with all Teleoceratina,
whereas other Aceratheriini are closer to more ancient taxa (Amphicaenopus, Trigonias, Protacera-
therium, Plesiaceratherium, and Menoceras). All members of the subtribe Rhinocerotina group to-
gether towards positive values, with Stephanorhinus, Dicerorhinus, Dihoplus and Rhinoceros overlap-
ping the Aphelops-Teleoceratina cluster. The highest PC1 values are associated with the modern Afri-
can clade (Ceratotherium-Diceros) and their extinct relatives, and the Coelodonta clade. PC2 represents
9.7% of the global variance. It is mainly driven by an opposition between Hyrachyidae, Hyracodontidae
and Rhinocerotina towards negative values and Amynodontidae, Paraceratheriidae and all other Rhi-
nocerotidae towards positive values. Urtinotherium is strongly isolated from all other species towards
maximal positive values.

The shape variation along PC1 is mainly related to the bone slenderness (Figure 29A and Appendix 4A).
Towards the minimal values, the humerus is thin and straight, with a greater trochanter developed
cranio-medially; an asymmetrical bicipital groove; a rounded humeral head oriented proximo-caudally;

GI-MC3 (r = 0.37, p = 0.03) (Table 12). PGLS results indicate that CS, BM and GI-MC3 are all significantly
correlated with humerus shape (Table 13). NNI procedure indicates that the correlation with BM is
more strongly affected by phylogenetic uncertainties than that with CS (Table 13). This may be related
to a smaller and less diverse sample for BM values. Regression of shape against CS shows a very good
fit to the regression line, most of the species following a marked common trend with little divergences
far away from the line (Figure 31A). Most of the Rhinocerotina and Teleoceratina are situated below
the regression line while the other species are situated above. Urtinotherium appears as slightly shifted
from the general trend. In the absence of many taxa such as Hyracodontidae, Amynodontidae and
Paraceratheriidae, regression of shape against BM shows a good fit to the regression line. The trend is
strongly driven by Hyrachyus, which potentially constitutes a bias. However, a clear separation exists
between Aceratheriini, all situated below the regression line, and Rhinocerotina and Teleoceratina,
mainly situated above the line (Figure 31B). Results for GI-MC3 indicate a very good fit to the regression
line as well. Rhinocerotina group almost all together above the line while Teleoceratina are situated
below the line. All other species are mixed close to the common trend. Hyrachyidae and Hyracodonti-
dae are isolated towards minimal values (Figure 31C). If shape variation related to these three variables
mainly concerns an increase of robustness towards maximal values (Figure 31 and Appendix 5A, B, C),
that related to BM (that lacks heavy Paraceratheriidae) is slightly different from those related to CS
and GI-MC3, with a stronger medio-lateral development of both epiphyses relatively to the shaft (Fig-
ure 31B). Most of the shape variation occurs on the medial face of the bone and on strong muscular
insertions like the deltoid tuberosity and the epicondylar crest for the three variables. In addition, BM
variation affects the bicipital groove while variation of GI-MC3 implies shape changes located distally
and caudally to the humeral head, from the deltoid tuberosity and tricipital line to the lesser tubercle
convexity (Figure 31C).

           Humerus – distal part
The phylogenetic signal carried by the shape variation of the distal humeri is strong (Kmult = 1.22, p <
0.01). The species distributions in the NJ tree (Figure 29B) and in the phylomorphospace are highly
similar to those observed for the complete humeri (Figure 30B). On the NJ tree, all Amynodontidae are
grouped together with Juxia (small Paraceratheriidae) while giant Paraceratheriidae group together
close to some Aceratheriini (Aphelops, Chilotherium). Other Aceratheriini are mixed with Teleoceratina
and more basal taxa, while Rhinocerotina form a homogeneous cluster all together. A similar organi-
sation is observable in the phylomorphospace, where the first two axes represent 70.2% of the global
variance. PC1 carries 55% of the global variance and PC2 carries 15.2%. The species distribution along
both axes is largely similar to that observed for the complete humerus (Figure 30B). Small and large
Amynodontidae group together with the light Paraceratheriidae Juxia, while heavier Paraceratheriidae
form an isolated cluster along PC2. Within Rhinocerotina, species seem distributed from the smallest
to the largest along PC1 despite some exceptions (e.g. Dihoplus megarhinus, Rhinoceros unicornis).
Chilotherium shows the highest positive value on PC1.

The shape variation along PC1 is highly similar to that observed on complete bones (Figure 30B and
Appendix 4B). Towards positive maximal values, PC1 is mainly associated with an increase of thickness,
with a strong development of the epicondylar crest; a broad olecranon fossa; an asymmetrical trochlea

with a reduced capitulum. Along PC2, the shape variation is also almost identical to that observed on
complete bones.

The evolutionary variation of the centroid size of partial humeri carries a significant phylogenetic signal
(KCS = 1.39, p < 0.001). The correlation between CS and BM is higher than for the complete humeri (r =
0.73) and correlation between CS and GI-MC3 is significant (r = 0.50) (Table 12). Like for complete
bones, PGLS results indicate a significant correlation between humerus shape and CS, BM and GI-MC3,
respectively. NNI procedure indicates that phylogenetic uncertainties do not highly affect the relation
between shape and the three variables (Table 13). The regression plot of shape against CS indicates an
excellent fit to the regression line with a tendency similar to that observed on complete bones, but
with Hyrachyidae, Hyracodontidae, Amynodontidae and Paraceratheriidae slightly shifted towards less
robust shapes for a given CS than Rhinocerotidae (Figure 32A). The presence of Amynodontidae and
Paraceratheriidae in the regression of shape against BM highlights a strongly similar tendency and a
very strong fit to the regression line (Figure 32B). The regression plot of shape against GI-MC3 is almost
identical to that obtained on complete bones with a good fit to the regression line as well (Figure 32C).
Similarly, the shape variation is very similar to that of complete bones for the three variables, mainly
affecting the general robustness and muscular insertions such as the epicondylar crest that is broad-
ened (Figure 32 and Appendix 5D, E, F). Only the shape variation associated with BM slightly differs
with an epicondylar crest less developed than for complete bones towards maximum values.

          Radius
Like for the humerus, the phylogenetic signal carried by shape data of the radii is strong (Kmult = 1.15,
p < 0.01). However, the species distributions in the NJ tree (Figure 29C) and in the phylomorphospace
(Figure 33) are less reminiscent of the phylogeny and seem likely related to the degree of brachypody.
Along the NJ tree, Hyrachyidae group with Hyracodontidae, Paraceratheriidae and small Elasmothe-
riinae. Aceratheriini, Teleoceratina and Rhinocerotina are mixed together with larger Elasmotheriinae,
most of the species being sorted by their gracility rather than mass or size. This pattern is highly similar
to that seen on the PCA, with the first two axes representing 75% of the global variance (Figure 33).
PC1 gathers 70.7% of the global variance. Along this axis, Triplopus constitutes the positive maximum.
Contrary to the morphospace obtained for the humerus, two of the biggest species of the sample,
Juxia and Urtinotherium, plot together with the smallest and lightest species. Paraceratherium groups
with small Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotidae i. s., as well as Amynodon and Paramynodon. Towards
negative values, Aceratheriini, Teleoceratina and Rhinocerotina are grouped together with larger Elas-
motheriinae (Hispanotherium and Elasmotherium). Within this cluster, Stephanorhinus, Dicerorhinus
and some Dihoplus plot with Aphelops, Peraceras and Hoploaceratherium, whereas larger

Like for the humerus, the shape variation of the radius along PC1 is mainly related to the bone slen-
derness (Figure 33 and Appendix 4C). The shape associated with maximal values is thin and slender,
with slight cranio-caudal and medio-lateral bends; a rectangular glenoid cavity with a lateral expansion
for the capitulum; a shaft as large medio-laterally as the two epiphyses; a rectangular and shallow
distal articular surface; a poorly developed radial styloid process. Conversely, the shape associated
with the minimal values is massive with a large asymmetrical glenoid cavity; almost no lateral devel-
opment of the cavity for the capitulum; both epiphyses medio-laterally larger than the diaphysis; a
radial styloid process developed distally; a rectangular and deep distal articular surface.

Like for humerus, the evolutionary variation of the centroid size of the radius carries a significant phy-
logenetic signal (KCS = 0.82, p < 0.001). The correlation between CS and BM is significant and high (r =
0.80) whereas CS and GI-MC3 are not correlated (Table 12). However, PGLS results indicate a strong
and significant correlation between the radius shape and GI-MC3 only (Table 13). PGLS computed on
NNI trees indicate that correlation with BM is affected by phylogenetic uncertainties and may be sig-
nificant or not depending on the tree configuration. Conversely, correlation with CS appears as always
non-significant and GI-MC3 as always significant for whatever the tree configuration (Table 13). The
regression plot of shape against GI-MC3 indicates an excellent fit to the regression line, with a strong
common trend shared by all members of the superfamily. Although most Rhinocerotina are situated
above the regression line, they are mixed together with Aceratheriini, Teleoceratina and large Elas-
motheriinae. Giant Paraceratheriidae plot together with small Elasmotheriinae and almost all Amyno-
dontidae, while Juxia is close to Hyrachyus and Hyracodon. Triplopus plots towards minimal values
(Figure 34A). GI-MC3 variation is correlated to a medio-lateral development of the bone appearing
stronger on the lateral side of both epiphyses than on the medial one (Figure 34A and Appendix 5G)
and to an overall increase in robustness. The correlation between radius shape and BM is marginally
non-significant (p = 0.04) (Table 13), although the dispersion of species indicates a rather good fit to
the regression line. Paraceratheriidae and Teleoceras deviate strongly from the common regression
trend, while Rhinocerotina and Elasmotheriinae strongly follow it (see Appendix 6A for regression
plot). If the shape variation associated with maximal values of BM is mainly related to a medio-lateral
development of both epiphyses like for GI-MC3, the deformation shows a higher intensity for BM on
the lateral part of the proximal epiphysis, where inserts the m. biceps brachii, and a lower intensity on
the distal epiphysis. These changes are also associated to a slight increase of robustness towards high
BM values (see Appendix 6A for shape variation).

         Ulna – complete bone
The shape variation of the complete ulnae carries a strong phylogenetic signal (Kmult = 0.93, p < 0.01).
The NJ tree (Figure 29D) shows a grouping of Hyrachyidae, Hyracodontidae, small Elasmotheriinae and

Juxia (which slightly isolates from this cluster). Aceratheriini group together with some Diaceratherium
but also the Amynodontidae, while all other Teleoceratina are grouped together and slightly isolate
from other species. Metamynodon is placed between Aceratheriini and Teleoceratina, while all Rhino-
cerotina group together (also with Dia. lamilloquense). A similar structure is observed on the phylo-
morphospace, with the first two axes representing 70.2% of the global variance (Figure 35A). The first
axis carries 54.7% of the variance. Juxia plots towards minimal values. Small Elasmotheriinae group
together with Trigonias, Protaceratherium and Paramynodon towards minimal values. However, Am-
phicaenopus and Metamynodon group with a cluster containing Aceratheriini and Rhinocerotini, as
well as some Diaceratherium. Within Rhinocerotina, larger taxa such as Ce. simum, R. unicornis, Co.
antiquitatis or Dh. pikermiensis group towards slightly higher values. Prosantorhinus, Brachypother-
ium, Dia. aurelianense and Teleoceras constitute the highest positive values. The second axis accounts
for 15.5% of the global variance. Hyrachyus and Rhinocerotina group together in the negative part of
the axis with almost no overlapping of the other species. Rhinocerotidae i. s. plot around null values
together with Hyracodon, Amynodontidae, small Elasmotheriinae, Hoploaceratherium and Dia. lamil-
loquense. All other Teleoceratina group with Aceratheriini and Juxia towards the highest positive val-
ues.

Like for the humerus and the radius, the shape variation of the ulna along PC1 is mainly related to the
bone slenderness (Figure 35A and Appendix 4D). The shape associated with minimal values is highly
thin and slender with an olecranon tuberosity developed proximally; a symmetrical and medio-laterally
flattened articular surface for the humerus; a shaft bended in cranio-caudal direction and highly com-
pressed medio-laterally; a narrow and shallow distal articular surface; an articular surface for the pisi-
form developed proximally. Conversely, the shape associated with maximal values is robust and mas-
sive with a strong olecranon tuberosity developed proximo-caudally; a large and asymmetrical articular
surface for the humerus; a massive and straight shaft with a triangular section; a distal epiphysis de-
veloped medio-laterally; a distal articular surface wide and deep; a reduced articular surface for the
pisiform. Along PC2, the shape associated with minimal values display an olecranon tuberosity devel-
oped proximo-distally; an anconeus process developed cranially; a shaft bended cranio-caudally; a nar-
row distal articular surface. The shape associated with maximal values displays an olecranon tuberosity
developed mainly caudally; an anconeus process poorly developed cranially; a shaft with a curved cau-
dal border and a straight cranial border; a wide and medially tilted distal articular surface.

The evolutionary variation of the centroid size of the complete ulnae carries a significant phylogenetic
signal (KCS = 0.84, p = 0.002). Neither BM nor GI-MC3 are significantly correlated with CS (Table 12).
Like for the radius, PGLS results highlight only a strong and significant correlation between the ulna
shape and GI-MC3 (Table 13). PGLS computed on NNI trees confirm that neither BM nor CS are

significantly correlated with shape whatever the phylogenetic configuration (Table 13). Like for the
radius, the regression plot of shape against GI-MC3 shows a very good fit to the regression line and
highlights a strong common trend with few outliers. However, groups are more clearly separated than
for the radius, with almost all Rhinocerotina plotting above the regression line, while other species plot
below the line. Teleoceratina and Aceratheriini form well-separated groups with few overlapping with
other species. Small Elasmotheriinae plot with Amynodontidae while Hyrachyus and Juxia plot towards
minimal values (Figure 34B). A higher GI-MC3 is associated with a more robust and straighter ulna,
showing a cranio-caudal and medio-lateral broadening and a strong development of the olecranon
tubercle, as well as a development of the lateral insertion area for digit extensors along the shaft (Fig-
ure 34B and Appendix 5H).

          Ulna – without the olecranon tuberosity
Shape data of the ulna without the olecranon tuberosity carry a strong phylogenetic signal (Kmult = 0.81,
p < 0.01). The NJ tree (Figure 29E) and phylomorphospace (Figure 35B) are very similar to those ob-
tained for the complete ulnae. One of the main differences with the complete ulna is the position of
the heavy Elasmotherium: the NJ tree highlights that this genus shares shape similarity with poorly
related taxa like Amphicaenopus and Metamynodon. On the phylomorphospace, the two first axes of
the PCA account for 68.9% of the global variance. PC1 represent 51.5% while PC2 accounts for 17.4%.
Again, Elasmotherium plots far away from smaller Elasmotheriinae like Subhyracodon and Menoceras
along PC1, and closer to Amphicaenopus, Metamynodon and Aphelops (Figure 35B). The shape varia-
tion associated with both axes is largely equivalent to that observed for the complete ulna (Figure 35B
and Appendix 4E). PC1 is mainly driven by a change of slenderness and proportion of both epiphyses
relatively to the shaft, with a highly massive and robust bone towards positive maximum. PC2 is mainly
driven by changes of both orientation of the olecranon development and straightness of the shaft.
Towards minimal values, the olecranon is oriented almost completely caudally and the cranial border
of the shaft is fully straight.

Like for the complete ulna, the evolutionary variation of the CS of the ulna without olecranon carries
a significant phylogenetic signal (KCS = 0.78, p = 0.003). Conversely, CS is significantly and strongly cor-
related with BM (r = 0.50) but not with GI-MC3 (Table 12). Results of the PGLS indicate only a significant
correlation between shape and GI-MC3, which is not affected by phylogenetic uncertainties. Con-
versely, the correlation between shape and CS remains non-significant regardless of phylogenetic un-
certainties (Table 13). If the regression plot displays a trend relatively similar to that observed on com-
plete ulnae, the fit to the regression line is poorer. Rhinocerotina and Teleoceratina are much more
distant from the common regression slope, contrary to what it is observed for the radius and complete
ulna. Elasmotherium and Amphicaenopus plot close to Rhinocerotina, which form a well-isolated

cluster above the regression line (Figure 34C). Shape variation related to GI-MC3 is highly similar to
that observed along PC1, with a much more pronounced variation along the lateral side of the shaft
(Figure 34C and Appendix 5I). As observed on the radius, PGLS computed on BM display marginally
non-significant results and NNI trees lead to significant or non-significant correlations between shape
and BM depending on the considered phylogeny (Table 13). The regression plot shows a rather good
fit to the regression line, despite some clear outliers. Most Rhinocerotina plot below the regression
line, together with some Teleoceratina, while Aceratheriini form a central cluster. Elasmotherium plots
towards maximal values while Menoceras plots towards negative values. This poorly significant regres-
sion can be related to the isolation of Juxia away from the common trend (see Appendix 6B for regres-
sion plot). The shape variation related to BM mainly concerns the caudal border of the ulna, particu-
larly the area placed distally to the olecranon (see Appendix 6B).

         Ulna – proximal part
Shape data of the proximal parts of the ulnae carry a strong phylogenetic signal (Kmult = 0.72, p < 0.01).
The NJ tree (Figure 29F) and the phylomorphospace (Figure 35C) show marked differences with previ-
ous analyses on the complete bones or on the ulna without the olecranon tubercle. The NJ tree is more
congruent with phylogenetic groupings than is the phylomorphospace (Figure 29F and 9C). Rhinoce-
rotina form a homogeneous cluster (except for Lartetotherium) close to a group containing small Elas-
motheriinae, Protaceratherium, Hyracodon and Hyrachyus. Aceratheriini and Teleoceratina are mixed
together. Paraceratheriidae and Amynodontidae plot with Amphicaenopus among the Aceratheriini-
Teleoceratina group. On the phylomorphospace, the two first axes of the PCA carry 55.2% of the global
variance (Figure 35C). PC1 represent 31.1% of the global variance. Along this axis, Hyrachyus is isolated
towards positive values. Hyracodon and Amynodontidae plot in a cluster grouping Rhinocerotina, Elas-
motheriinae and Rhinocerotidae i. s. Aceratheriini and Teleoceratina isolate towards negative values.
Paraceratheriidae are placed between the Rhinocerotina cluster and the Aceratheriini-Teleoceratina
one, together with other taxa like Lartetotherium, Metamynodon and Amphicaenopus. The second
axis, representing 24.1% of the variance, is mainly driven by the isolation of Paraceratheriidae from all
other species, especially the two big forms of the genus Paraceratherium, towards minimal values.
Almost all other species form a single and mixed cluster from null to positive values without any clear
organisation.

Like for the complete ulna, the shape variation of the proximal part of the ulna along PC1 mainly relates
to the slenderness of the bone (Figure 35C and Appendix 4F). The shape associated with maximal val-
ues is thin and slender with a high olecranon tuberosity, developed in proximal direction and medio-
laterally flattened; an anconeus process developed cranially; a symmetrical articular surface for the
humerus flattened medio-laterally; a long synostosis surface for the radius. Conversely, the shape

                     Chapter 5 – Shape variation of forelimb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


associated with minimal values is thick and massive, with a strong olecranon tubercle developed prox-
imo-caudally and enlarged medio-laterally; an anconeus process poorly developed; a wide and asym-
metrical articular surface for the humerus; a short synostosis surface for the radius. Along PC2, the
variation is mainly driven by the proportion, shape and orientation of the olecranon. Towards minimal
values, the proximal part of the ulna displays a massive and short olecranon, medio-laterally com-
pressed and poorly caudally developed; a large and trapezoid articular surface for the humerus; a
poorly developed anconeus process; a long synostosis surface for the radius developed medially. The
shape associated with maximal values displays a thinner and squared olecranon developed proximo-
caudally; a more triangular articular surface for the humerus; a short synostosis surface for the radius.

The evolutionary variation of the centroid size of the proximal part of the ulna carries a significant
phylogenetic signal (KCS = 1.91, p < 0.001). Like for the ulna without the olecranon tuberosity, the cen-
troid size is significantly and very strongly correlated with BM (r = 0.85) but not with GI-MC3 (Table
12). PGLS indicate a significant and high correlation between shape and each of the three variables,
similarly to what is observed on the complete and partial humerus (Table 13). However, both regres-
sion plots of shape against CS and BM must be considered with caution, as the dispersion of specimens
poorly fits the regression line. For CS, Aceratheriini and Teleoceratina form a cluster situated below
the regression line, together with Protaceratherium and small Elasmotheriinae, while Rhinocerotina
plot near the line. Paraceratheriidae, Amynodontidae and Rhinocerotidae i. s. plot above the line, while
Hyrachyus plots towards minimal CS values (Figure 36A). Similarly, for BM, Hyrachyidae and Paracera-
theriidae plot far away from the common regression slope, whereas among Rhinocerotidae, some Ac-
eratheriini and Teleoceratina are grouped together below the line (Figure 36B). Conversely, the regres-
sion plot for the GI-MC3 is very close to those obtained on the humerus and radius, with an excellent
fit to the regression line. All species are very close to the common regression line, with a marked over-
lap between the different groups (Figure 36C). Shape variation related to both CS, BM and GI-MC3 is
highly similar and mainly concerns a medio-lateral broadening towards high values, as well as a caudal
development of the caudal border of the ulna (Figure 36 and Appendix 5J, K, L). This broadening is
more marked for shape variation correlated with GI-MC3.

         Evolution of CS values along the phylogeny
The evolution of CS values along the phylogeny for the distal part of the humerus, complete radius and
proximal part of the ulna (these three samples being the largest) is relatively congruent between the
different taxa (Figure 37). Hyrachyidae-Hyracodontidae and giant Paraceratheriidae possess, respec-
tively, the lowest and highest values for each bone. However, the CS of the radius shows a greater
variation along the phylogeny than that of the humerus and ulna. Many taxa among Elasmotheriinae,

Discussion
         Relations between bone shape and mass, size and gracility
Results highlight the strong relations existing between the shape variation of the forelimb bones and
the changes in bone size, body mass and degree of gracility within Rhinocerotoidea, confirming the
first hypothesis. However, these relations appear complex and variable depending on the bone, the
anatomical area and the considerer parameter, resulting in congruent and non-congruent changes
along the limb.

             Congruent shape variation associated with all variables

Centroid size appears almost always significantly correlated with body mass, despite missing data, het-
erogeneous weight estimations and marginally non-significant results for the complete ulna. This sug-
gests that the CS of the long bones is relevant to approximate the weight of a species (Ercoli & Prevosti,
2011; Cassini, Vizcaíno & Bargo, 2012; Botton-Divet et al., 2017), at least on rhinos despite their diver-
sity of body size and shape. However, beyond this general strong correlation, the variation of CS along
the phylogeny for the radius differs from that observed for the humerus and ulna. Some groups may
also strongly differ from the general trend shown by the whole superfamily because of specific mor-
phological changes (i.e. Teleoceratina) (see below). Conversely, while BM correlates with GI-MC3, the
latter is poorly related to CS except for the distal part of the humerus (and marginally for the complete
humerus and proximal part of the ulna). This highlights that, beyond the significant correlation be-
tween bone size and body mass, these parameters do not vary conjointly with the degree of brachy-
pody among the superfamily.

The complete humerus, distal humerus and proximal ulna share strong similarities in having their
shape variation always correlated with CS, BM and GI-MC3. An increase of these variables is always
associated with an increase of the bone robustness, confirming previous observations on modern (Mal-
let et al., 2019, 2020) and fossil rhinos (Prothero & Sereno, 1982; Etienne et al., 2020). Other areas
mainly impacted by shape modification across the superfamily are epiphyses, which mainly extend in
the medio-lateral direction in heavy species. These global changes tend to indicate the existence of a
common trend within the entire superfamily Rhinocerotoidea for these bones, where shape varies
relatively congruously with size, mass and gracility despite the morphological diversity of these species.

The shape changes linked to size, mass or gracility are particularly congruent on the humerus, affecting
mainly the medial side of the bone, from the lesser tubercle tuberosity where inserts the m. subscap-
ularis to the midshaft where insert the m. teres major and the m. latissimus dorsi, these muscles acting
as adductors and extensors of the arm. On the lateral side, most shape changes are located on the
deltoid tuberosity, where inserts the m. deltoideus, being more laterally developed and more distally

                                                   189


                      Chapter 5 – Shape variation of forelimb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


situated on the shaft for high values of body mass, centroid size and gracility index (with a maximum
for GI-MC3 – see below). This distal displacement of the mm. deltoideus and of the teres major is co-
herent with an increase in strength of the lever arm for arm flexion and extension required to move
heavier body and limbs (Hildebrand, 1974; Polly, 2007). Such a distal displacement observed simulta-
neously among taxa opposed in gracility and body mass (like Teleoceratina and Paraceratheriidae) can
appear paradoxical. A longer and stronger lever arm in large Paraceratheriidae is likely related to
longer and heavier limbs requiring more strength to be moved. Similarly, this condition in highly
brachypodial taxa may result from a difference in mass repartition: a lower centre of gravity associated
with a relatively high body mass and small limbs require powerful muscles with strong insertions to
move efficiently (Hildebrand, 1974; Coughlin & Fish, 2009; Biewener & Patek, 2018). Similar observa-
tions can be done for the distal epiphysis, where most of the changes are located on the medial and
lateral epicondyles and the epicondylar crest when mass, size and brachypody increase. These changes
are likely associated with the development of powerful muscles for the extension movements of car-
pals and digits (Fisher, Scott & Naples, 2007; Barone, 2010a) and can relate to changes in mass repar-
tition and position of the centre of gravity as well.

Contrary to what is observed for the humerus and the proximal ulna, the shape variation of the radius
and ulna (complete and without the olecranon) are only significantly correlated with the gracility index,
and marginally with body mass. Both the radius and ulna show a reduction of the cranio-caudal curva-
ture and a straightening of the shaft with increasing body mass and brachypody. These changes are
coherent with modifications observed on the humerus, highlighting the necessity to resist both higher
pressure forces and stronger bending in brachypodial species (Bertram & Biewener, 1992; Milne, 2016;
Henderson et al., 2017). On the ulna, the congruent changes observed along the caudal edge of the
bone towards high body mass and degree of brachypody are likely linked to a modification of the ori-
entation of the olecranon tuberosity (see below).

             Non-congruent shape variation associated with variables

Beyond congruent shape variations between bones or body proportions (size, mass and gracility),
some anatomical areas appear to vary more in association with one particular variable. On the hu-
merus, this is likely the case of the bicipital groove, which is reoriented cranially and becomes more
symmetrical with the apparition of an intermediate tubercle for high body mass only. This confor-
mation is likely to play a role as a “passive stay-apparatus”, a feature convergently present in horses
as well, reducing the muscular energy needed to stand for long periods (Hermanson & MacFadden,
1992). A relatively developed intermediate tubercle is observed in many groups showing high body
mass (Paraceratheriidae, Aceratheriini, Rhinocerotina, Teleoceratina and, to a lesser extent, Amyno-
dontidae), indicating the presence of a partially or fully functional passive stay-apparatus in these

                     Chapter 5 – Shape variation of forelimb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


heavy species. Although this feature in horses is associated with a cursorial condition, equids spending
long periods of time in a standing pose, its development among Rhinocerotoidea appears mainly re-
lated to their body mass.

A pronounced development of the radial tuberosity, where inserts the m. biceps brachii, is observable
on the radius. This development is only associated with body mass increase. This may be related to the
strong flexion forces exerted by this muscle on the radius, likely related to the strength needed to
move heavier limbs in large taxa (or a relatively short limb in species with a low centre of gravity).
Moreover, the m. biceps brachii is also a relevant muscle involved in the passive-stay apparatus of the
shoulder joint (Hermanson & MacFadden, 1992). The development of the radial tuberosity in associa-
tion with body mass only is therefore coherent with changes observed on the humeral bicipital groove
for the same variable.

On the ulna, the lateral border of the shaft shows a marked variation associated only with a high degree
of brachypody. This area corresponds to the insertion of the carpal extensors (Barone, 2010b) and its
development is coherent with that observed on the epicondylar crest of the humerus (see above). Like
for other extensors previously described, the marked development of these insertions along the ulna
in brachypodial species may relate to the lowering of the centre of gravity and the higher power
needed to move efficiently a short-limb body.

         Congruent variations between bones
Congruent shape variations are also observed between bones, which partially infirm the second hy-
pothesis. The tricipital line running from the deltoid process to the humeral head on the humerus is
particularly affected by changes in the degree of brachypody. This area corresponds to the insertion of
the lateral head of the m. triceps brachii. On the proximal ulna, an increase of size and mass, but above
all of brachypody, involves morphological changes of the olecranon tuberosity, where inserts the ter-
minal heads of the m. triceps brachii as well, one of the most powerful extensors of the forelimb en-
suring stance of the body and opposing to gravity (Watson & Wilson, 2007; Barone, 2010b). Further-
more, the development of its insertion is associated with a reorientation of the whole olecranon to-
wards high body mass and degree of brachypody. These changes indicate a wider angle for elbow
opening and a modification of the angulation of the olecranon process relatively to the shaft, known
to strongly change with body mass among quadrupeds (Jenkins, 1973; Fujiwara, 2009; Fujiwara &
Hutchinson, 2012; Milne, 2016; Henderson et al., 2017).

Similarly, the distal trochlea of the humerus undergoes strong changes linked simultaneously to in-
creases in mass, size and brachypody, becoming asymmetrical, wider and flattened, with a drastic re-
duction of the capitulum and a huge development of the medial lip. This conformation responds to

                     Chapter 5 – Shape variation of forelimb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


changes observed on the radius and ulna when mass and brachypody increase. The proximal articular
surfaces of the radius and ulna, forming the trochlear notch, lose their asymmetry and concavity in
brachypodial taxa. Such coherent changes of the elbow region confer more degrees of freedom in the
medio-lateral direction, contrary to the structure encountered in light and cursorial rhinos only allow-
ing cranio-caudally constrained movements. This likely allows the elbow joint to support stronger con-
straints in multiple directions due to heavy weight (Polly, 2007). Such changes are coherent with similar
modifications observed on the ankle joint of Rhinocerotoidea (Etienne et al., 2020), but also with ob-
servations made on modern rhinos presented in Chapter 3 (Mallet et al., 2019), indicating a develop-
ment of the medial parts of limb bones over lateral ones for heavier species. All these morphological
modifications in the elbow region, directly linked to a higher mass in heavy taxa, may relate to a low-
ering of the centre of gravity of the animal in brachypodial species, involving more muscle power and
longer lever arms when associated with shorter limb segments for a given mass (Hildebrand, 1974).

         Differences between the stylopodium and zeugopodium
Beyond these coherent changes located on precise anatomical areas, the patterns of shape variations
appear very different between the stylopodial and the zeugopodial elements. While the variations of
the humeral shape follow a trend common to the whole superfamily and are simultaneously related
to size, mass and gracility, those of the radius and the ulna are only related to the degree of brachypody
(with a marginal effect of body mass). This relation between shape and brachypody is strikingly high
for the radius. All these results likely indicate a deep functional breakdown between the stylopodium
and the zeugopodium. This is coherent with an increase of the variation of limb elements along a prox-
imo-distal gradient, as hypothesized by previous authors (Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall, 2002; Young
& Hallgrímsson, 2005). Thanks to its oblique orientation in the limb, the humerus ensures weight sup-
port by allowing the dissipation of stresses, while also being the support of muscles linked both to the
pectoral girdle and the carpals. It therefore ensures the flexion and extension of the whole forelimb
(Polly, 2007). At the opposite, the radius and the shaft of the ulna, oriented vertically, are strongly
aligned with pressure constraints due to gravity. The proximal articular surface of the radius supports
the entirety of the humerus and, consequently, a significant part of the body weight – the forelimb
itself supporting a larger proportion of the total weight than the hind limb (Henderson, 2006; Regnault
et al., 2013; Stilson, Hopkins & Davis, 2016; Panagiotopoulou, Pataky & Hutchinson, 2019). Results
highlight however that the zeugopodial shape is only related to variations of brachypody, underlining
the importance of the repartition of mass in the body and the position of the centre of gravity, rather
than to the absolute body mass itself. The influence of the body mass value itself is more visible at
lower taxonomic levels (i.e. within families or subfamilies), as it has been observed among modern
rhinos in Chapters 3 and 4 (Mallet et al., 2019, 2020).

         Modularity of the elbow joint
Beyond the congruences previously described between the humerus and the ulna, the exploration of
the shape of both complete and partial bones, driven at first by taphonomic constraints, led to unex-
pected functional observations. Whereas the complete and distal humerus show similar results, strong
differences occur between the whole ulna and its proximal part (in their relations between shape, size,
mass and gracility, while the shaft and the distal part seem to follow the same pattern as the radius.
The proximal part of the ulna displays similar patterns of variation as the humerus ones (complete and
distal), its shape being not only linked to gracility as in the complete ulna, but also to mass and size.
This is particularly visible in Paraceratheriidae, whose complete ulna is close to the plesiomorphic con-
dition but whose proximal part of the ulna shows a derived morphology coherent with the humerus
one. Additional analyses on the isolated proximal part of the radius do not show this morphological
shift and led to results highly similar to those obtained on complete radius (pers. obs.). The elbow is
known as a simple yet crucial hinge joint among quadrupeds, involved both in locomotion and stability
of the body (Jenkins, 1973; Fujiwara, 2009; Fujiwara & Hutchinson, 2012). The humerus and ulna share
complementary articular surfaces and are connected by numerous muscles (m. anconeus and flexor
and extensor muscles of the carpals and digits) and a strong joint cap (Barone, 2010a). Consequently,
the humerus and ulna are strongly integrated among quadrupeds, i.e. show a noticeable shape covari-
ation (Fabre et al., 2014b; Martín‐Serra et al., 2015; Hanot et al., 2017; Botton-Divet et al., 2018), no-
tably among modern rhinos as observed in Chapter 4 (Mallet et al., 2020). My results indicate that this
covariation is likely to concern mainly the distal part of the humerus and the proximal part of the ulna,
leading to consider the elbow as a probable modular structure among Rhinocerotoidea, i.e. an ana-
tomical unit covarying more in itself than with other units (Klingenberg, 2008). Beyond purely func-
tional requirements, this potential modularity can also be related to an evolutionary covariation of
size, mass and gracility among Rhinocerotoidea. Similar observations have been highlighted in small
carnivorans (Fabre et al., 2014b) and this assertion yet remains to be tested on modern and fossil
rhinos through modularity tests (Goswami & Polly, 2010).

         Bone shape and phylogenetic relationships
In addition to functional requirements, the evolutionary legacy between species has a strong but une-
qually distributed influence on the shape variation of the forelimb. Shape, size, mass and the degree
of brachypody all carry a strong phylogenetic signal underlining that their variation is constrained by
historical factors (Cubo, 2004). This influence is particularly visible on the humerus: most of the con-
sidered groups display a marked shape homogeneity despite variation in body proportions. This is not
the case for the radius and the ulna, where the different groups are split depending more on their
mass or degree of brachypody rather than their phylogenetic affinities. This is coherent with previous

                                                   193


                     Chapter 5 – Shape variation of forelimb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


results on modern rhinos indicating that the shape of the stylopodium is more related to the phylogeny
than that of the zeugopodium (Mallet et al., 2019, 2020). This pattern seems to occur at the level of
the whole superfamily, in accordance with the hypothesis of an increase of variation of the limb ele-
ments along a proximo-distal gradient (Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall, 2002; Young & Hallgrímsson,
2005).

However, one particular group does not seem to follow this general trend. While being closely related
to stem clades like Hyracodontidae, giant Paraceratheriidae exhibit a humeral shape close to that of
more derived groups like Aceratheriini. Marked shape changes relatively to the shape displayed by
Hyracodontidae or Hyrachyidae are observable on the humerus. Conversely, the shapes of the radius
and ulna (except for the proximal part of the latter) appear to retain a plesiomorphic condition close
to that of small Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae, these bones displaying little morphological changes
except their striking relative size. These observations underline the particularity of this group among
Rhinocerotoidea, whose unique body shape has puzzled biologists since their discovery (Granger &
Gregory, 1936; Prothero, 2013). These considerations appear contradictory with my previous findings
indicating that the radius shape is strongly related to the degree of brachypody and poorly to phylog-
eny (and conversely for the humerus). It is possible that Paraceratheriidae underwent particular de-
velopmental processes constraining the zeugopodium shape, while the stylopodium was subject to
marked morphological changes to ensure its role in body support and propulsion, constituting a unique
pattern within the superfamily. Ecological factors may also have a role in shaping the forelimb of
Paraceratheriidae but this question remains to be address in a dedicated study.

Two other groups show marked differences with the common trend of shape variation among Rhino-
cerotoidea: the subtribes Teleoceratina and Rhinocerotina. Species belonging to Teleoceratina like Tel-
eoceras show a high degree of brachypody and their forelimb bones often display an extreme shape
relatively to the whole superfamily, particularly on the zeugopodium. Their extreme brachypody had
sometimes been associated with a semi-aquatic ecology, although this hypothesis is now considered
unlikely (MacFadden, 1998; Mead, 2000; Mihlbachler, 2003; Prothero, 2005; Clementz, Holroyd, &
Koch, 2008; Wang & Secord, 2020). Despite the unique limb morphology of Teleoceratina, my results
highlight many shape resemblances with fully terrestrial Aceratheriini (Aphelops, Peraceras) and Rhi-
nocerotina (Coelodonta) and do not support the hypothesis of a semi-aquatic ecology either. A mor-
phofunctional analysis focused on this subtribe could help to understand the factors driving this par-
ticular limb construction.

Finally, Rhinocerotina display a high shape homogeneity, particularly on the humerus and the ulna,
despite a broad range of body mass and body proportions. The range of shape variation within this

subtribe appears thus highly constrained by the evolutionary history. The diverse ecological prefer-
ences encountered in Rhinocerotina do not seem to strongly impact the shape variation (Guérin, 1980;
Cerdeño, 1998). However, this relative homogeneity relatively to the whole superfamily likely encom-
passes different trends of shape variation between genera that remain to be explored in detail.

Conclusion
The relations between shape variation of the forelimb bones, body proportions and phylogeny among
Rhinocerotoidea vary but general trends are clearly observed despite this complexity. A trend common
to the whole superfamily is the increase of bone robustness towards a higher body mass and higher
degree of brachypody. The reinforcement of the insertions for the extensor muscles enables the ani-
mals to counteract the gravitational constraints when body mass increases. However, strong differ-
ences in shape variation exist between the stylopodium and the zeugopodium. The shape of the hu-
merus modifies following size, mass and brachypody in a similar way within the whole superfamily,
while being also strongly constrained by the evolutionary history. Conversely, the shape of the
zeugopodium appears only driven by the degree of brachypody, namely the distribution of mass within
the body (centre of gravity), rather than by the absolute mass itself. Surprisingly, the shape variation
of bones in the elbow caudal region show striking similarities, suggesting a likely modular organisation
of the humerus and ulna. Beyond these general trends, groups like Paraceratheriidae, Teleoceratina
and Rhinocerotina display divergent patterns that remain to be fully understood. Consequently, this
exploration of the forelimb shape among Rhinocerotoidea encourages the application of the same
morphofunctional approach on the hind limb to highlight how shape patterns converge or diverge be-
tween limbs under a similar weight constraint.

Introduction
The previous chapter explored the shape variation of forelimb elements among the superfamily Rhi-
nocerotoidea. It notably highlighted a common general increase of bone robustness towards high body
mass, associated with relatively larger epiphyses. Il also underlines that shape is not equally associated
with size, mass and gracility among forelimb bones. If centroid size correlated strongly with body mass,
and may be considered as a good proxy of the latter, these two parameters appeared as decoupled
from the level of brachypody (i.e. the degree of limb shortening) for some taxa, especially in Paracera-
theriidae, Elasmotheriinae and Teleoceratina. Whereas humerus shape seemed to be significantly re-
lated to these three factors, the radius and ulna ones were more strongly correlated with the species
degree of brachypody, and poorly follow body mass variation. The shape variation patterns observed
on the stylopodium followed more the evolutionary history than those observed on the zeugopodium.
The study of some partial anatomical areas, first driven by the need to include more specimens despite
taphonomic alterations, highlighted that proximal or distal epiphyses may vary differently than the
rest of the bone in relation to different parameters like size, mass or gracility. It notably appeared that
the elbow joint may represent a morphological module.

These results encouraged me to extend this approach to the hind limb elements. Previous results on
modern rhinos (Chapters 3 and 4) indicated congruent shape variation between fore and hind limb
stylopodium elements (i.e. similar trends and high integration between the humerus and femur). It
appeared that shape variation and covariation were more likely related to phylogeny than body mass.
They also highlighted remarkable differences between fore and hind limb zeugopodial elements and a
stronger correlation between shape variation and body mass. These differences between fore and hind
limb elements may be related to divergent functional roles. Although all four limbs sustain the whole
body mass, quadrupedal mammals bear a significantly higher part of their body mass on the forelimbs
(Alexander, 1985; Henderson, 2006). This fact is particularly noticeable on rhinos, whose massive head,
powerful muscles forming their withers and presence of horns in some species, are likely to increase
the proportion of the total body mass carried by the forelimbs (Henderson, 1999; Regnault et al., 2013;
Stilson, Hopkins & Davis, 2016; Panagiotopoulou, Pataky & Hutchinson, 2019). Moreover, fore and hind
limbs do not act similarly during quadrupedal mammal locomotion, the former functioning as brakes
while the latter ensure body propulsion (Lessertisseur & Saban, 1967; Dutto et al., 2006). In addition,
even if the length of the fore and hind limbs is relatively similar in most Rhinocerotoidea, some taxa
like Paraceratheriidae display a non-horizontal spine associated with a reduction of the length of their
hind limb. This particular body plan likely changes which limbs support the largest part of the body
mass. This could be related to noticeable features in the shape of some hind limb elements, as it has
been previously observed on ankle bones of Perissodactyla (Etienne et al., 2020).

Like for the forelimb, the exploration of the shape variation of the hind limb bones could help under-
stand how the body mass and its repartition is associated with bone shape variation. Some similar
modifications are likely to be observed, as an increase of bone robustness towards high body mass.
However, relations between shape variation and centroid size, mean body mass and degree of gracility
might not be equivalent between the different hind limb bones (femur, tibia and fibula). Moreover,
the different roles of fore and hind limbs in the weight support and body propulsion of rhinos should
be associated with remarkable differences in their shape variation. Given previous results, I hypothe-
size: (a) congruences and incongruences between the shape variation and mass, size and gracility; (b)
differences between stylopodial and zeugopodial elements in their patterns of shape variation with
size, mass and gracility, but also (c) between complete and partial analyses; (d) a link between phylog-
eny and bone shape, likely different between the three studied bones; (e) differences in trends of
shape variation between the fore and the hind limbs possibly related to their distinct functional roles.

Material & Methods
The studied sample was composed of 215 bones of modern and fossil species of Rhinocerotoidea. The
sample includes 79 femora, 83 tibiae and 53 fibulae (see Appendix 1 of this chapter for the complete
list of studied specimens) representing 53 taxa (5 modern and 48 fossil species) (Figure 38). Due to lack
of well-preserved specimens, some species included in the forelimb analysis were absent from the hind
limb one (like many Amynodontidae or Juxia [Paraceratheriidae]). Reciprocally, others, like Pleuroceros
blanfordi (Rhinocerotinae incertae sedis) and Teleoceras hicksi (Teleoceratina), were only present in
the hind limb analysis. All anatomical terms are similar to those used in previous chapters and are
summarize in Chapter 3.

As the methodology of this chapter is almost strictly identical to that used in Chapter 5, I will only
briefly summarize hereafter the main differences with the study conducted on the forelimb bones. As
on the forelimb, some parts of the hind limb bones are often damaged or absent in fossil specimens.
This is notably the case on the femur, where the femoral head, the third trochanter, the medial lip of
the trochlea and the condyles were frequently too damaged to be included in shape analyses. To over-
come these taphonomic problems and include as many relevant specimens as possible (i.e. cover the
broadest range of body mass and size as possible), I extended the approach on partial bone analyses
previously applied on the humerus and the ulna. In addition to complete femur, tibia and fibula, I per-
formed partial analyses on isolated proximal and distal parts of the femur, using the same protocol as
described in Chapter 5 (see Appendix 2 of this chapter for details on landmarks in partial templates).
Moreover, given the results obtained on the forelimb bones (highlighting differences in shape variation
patterns between partial and complete humerus and ulna), the inclusion of partial parts of the femur
allowed to test if similar results would be discernible in hind limb bones.

A similar analytical framework was used: Neighbour Joining (NJ) trees and Principal Component Anal-
yses (PCA) were computed on landmarks coordinates after a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA)
and shape deformation along the two first axes. Multivariate regressions using Phylogenetic General-
ized Least Squares (PGLS) were used to explore the association between bone shape and three varia-
bles (called “body proportions” when taken together): species mean body mass (BM), bone centroid
size (CS) and species mean gracility index (computed here on the third metatarsal dividing its trans-
verse width by its maximal length (GI-MT3) (see Table 14 and Appendix 3 of this chapter on variable
computation). I addressed the effect of potential phylogenetic uncertainties on PGLS by using a Near-
est Neighbour Interchange (NNI) procedure as in Chapter 5.

All statistic tests have been considered as significant for p-values ≤ 0.01 but I also took into considera-
tion results associated with a p-value up to 0.05 (Wasserstein, Schirm & Lazar, 2019; Ho et al., 2019).

Results
          Correlation between BM and GI-MT3
Both mean BM and mean GI-MT3 carry a significant phylogenetic signal (KBM = 1.75, p < 0.01; KGI-MT3 =
1.08, p < 0.01) but are not significantly correlated to each other when taking into account phylogenetic
relationships (p = 0.06). The evolution of both parameters along the phylogeny (Figure 39) highlights
that the evolution of these parameters within the superfamily is decoupled in some taxa like Paracera-
theriidae, Teleoceratina and, at a lesser extent, large Elasmotheriinae

          Femur – complete bone
Shape data for the complete femur carry a strong phylogenetic signal (Kmult = 0.93, p < 0.01). The dis-
tribution of the species both in the NJ tree (Figure 40A) and in the phylomorphospace (Figure 41) is
strongly reminiscent of the phylogenetic relationships between taxa. Along the NJ tree, Hyrachyidae
group with Hyracodontidae, Elasmotheriinae (all of small size in the absence of Elasmotherium) and
some Rhinocerotinae (Protaceratherium and Pe. profectum). Paraceratherium groups with two species
of Aphelops while Metamynodon is close to some Aceratheriini (Hoploaceratherium) as well as some
Rhinocerotina (Lartetotherium). While Aceratheriini are dispersed along the tree, most of the Rhino-
cerotina are grouped together. Similarly, Teleoceratina form a homogeneous cluster despite the pres-
ence of P. hessei. Conversely, Chilotherium and Pleuroceros, two highly brachypodial taxa, plot within
Rhinocerotina, far from other brachypodial species like Teleoceras. On the phylomorphospace, the first
two axes gather 58.4% of the global variance. PC1, which carries 42.9% of the variance, displays a
structure similar to the general organisation of the NJ tree. Small taxa such as Hyrachyus and Hyraco-
don plot toward positive values. Towards negative values, small Elasmotheriinae plot near Metamyno-
don, Trigonias and small Aceratheriini. The giant Paraceratheriidae Urtinotherium plots near small taxa
like Trigonias or Protaceratherium, but also near Metamynodon. Towards the most negative values,
large Aceratheriini are mixed with Teleoceratina and Rhinocerotina. Along PC2, which carries 15.5% of
the variance, Rhinocerotina form a homogeneous cluster plotting towards negative values, together
with Metamynodon, Hyrachyus and Subhyracodon. Teleoceratina and Aceratheriini (except Ap.
malacorhinus) group together with Urtinotherium, Subhyracodon mitis and Hyracodon towards posi-
tive values.

The shape variation along PC1 is mainly related to the bone robustness (Figure 41 and Appendix 4A).
Positive values are associated with a slender bone showing a rounded hemispherical head with a nar-
row neck; a proximally developed greater trochanter tuberosity protruding over the head; an oval fo-
vea capitis; a third trochanter situated at the first proximal third of the shaft, more developed caudally
than laterally; a cranio-caudally straight shaft; a relatively symmetrical distal trochlea with a poorly

developed medial lip; a long and narrow trochlear groove running caudally to the shaft; a distal epiph-
ysis showing a medial torsion relatively to the shaft; relatively symmetrical medial and lateral condyles.
Conversely, negative values are associated with a thick and massive bone, with a general hourglass
shape in cranial view; a more flattened and wide head with a large neck; a greater trochanter tuberos-
ity poorly developed proximally and not protruding over the head; a small rounded fovea capitis; a
strong third trochanter clearly protruding laterally and cranially from the shaft; a shaft slightly curved
in the caudal direction; a strongly asymmetrical trochlea with a broad medial lip; a short and wide
trochlear groove; a distal epiphysis oriented cranially relatively to the shaft; a medial condyle more
developed than the lateral one. Along PC2, the shape variation mostly concerns the development of
the trochanters and the relative proportions of the epiphyses. The theoretical shape associated with
negative values shows proximal and distal epiphyses of similar medio-lateral width; a lesser trochanter
situated just below the head and above the third trochanter on the opposite side; a third trochanter
developed in both cranial and lateral directions. Conversely, the shape associated with positive values
displays a head and greater trochanter relatively larger; a head oriented more proximally; lesser and
third trochanters facing each other on the medial and lateral side of the shaft, respectively; a third
trochanter reduced to a bony ridge; a medial lip of the trochlea more developed cranially.

The centroid size of the complete femurs bears a significant phylogenetic signal (KCS = 1.05, p < 0.01)
and is significantly correlated with BM (r = 0.68, p < 0.01) but not with GI-MT3 (p = 0.37) (Table 15).
PGLS results indicate that shape is significantly correlated with CS, BM and GI-MT3. PGLS computed on
NNI trees highlight that variations in phylogenetic trees may result in marginally non-significant corre-
lations for CS and GI-MT3 but mean p-values are strongly significant (Table 16). In the regression plot
of shape against CS, the distribution of taxa shows a moderately good fit to the regression line. Hy-
rachyus, Hyracodon and Paraceratherium plots far from the regression line. Small Elasmotheriinae
group together with Protaceratherium and Trigonias. If some Aceratheriini group with these small taxa,
most of them are grouped with Rhinocerotina and Teleoceratina. Metamynodon also plots with this
large group, although further away from the regression line (Figure 42A). Hyrachyidae, Hyracodonti-
dae, Amynodontidae and Paraceratheriidae seem to follow an independent path parallel to the Rhino-
cerotidae one, but as these groups have few representatives here, this observation must be taken with
caution. Changes in CS values mainly affect the general robustness of the bone, as well as the greater
trochanter tuberosity and convexity, the femoral head and particularly the fovea capitis. Along the
shaft, the main changes are located on the lateral part between the greater trochanter convexity and
the third trochanter (where inserts the m. vastus lateralis), as well as along the distal half of the diaph-
ysis, on cranial and caudal sides. Lateral and medial parts of both condyles are also strongly modified
by CS variations (Figure 42A and Appendix 5A). The structure of the regression plot of shape against

BM is similar to that obtained with CS, with a moderately good fit to the regression line. Hyrachyus is
clearly isolated from all other species that form a large cluster at high BM values (Figure 42B).
Metamynodon plots outside this cluster and far away from the regression line. A variation of BM results
in the modifications of the same anatomical areas like for CS, although to a stronger extent, particularly
for the femoral head and the greater trochanter convexity. An increase of robustness is observed to-
wards high BM values. Shape changes are also located along the lesser trochanter, the medial lip of
the trochlea and the medial epicondyle (Figure 42B and Appendix 5B). The regression plot of shape
against GI-MT3 indicates a very good fit to the regression line. A clear opposition is observable between
Rhinocerotina, being almost all above the regression line, to all other species below the line.

Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae isolated towards minimal values, together with Menoceras, while
other small Elasmotheriinae group with Paraceratherium, Trigonias and some gracile Aceratheriini and
Rhinocerotina. Teleoceratina form a homogeneous cluster slightly isolated from other species (Figure
42C). Like for BM and CS, variations of GI-MT3 are associated with changes in the bone robustness, but
are also related to modifications located on both medial and lateral supracondylar areas where inserts
the m. gastrocnemius. However, contrary to what it is observed with BM, the medial lip of the trochlea
and the medial epicondyle are poorly modified with variations of GI-MT3 values (Figure 42C and Ap-
pendix 5C).

         Femur – proximal part
Shape data for the proximal part of the femur carry a significant phylogenetic signal (Kmult = 0.62, p <
0.01). The distribution of the species in the NJ tree (Figure 40B) and in the phylomorphospace (Figure
43A) shows marked differences with the results obtained on complete bones. The NJ tree is structured
by the separation in three main clusters: 1) Hyrachyidae, Hyracodontidae, small Elasmotheriinae to-
gether with one Rhinocerotinae incertae sedis (i. s.) (Protaceratherium) and one Aceratheriini (Pe.
profectum), 2) almost all Rhinocerotina together with Pleuroceros, and 3) Aceratheriini, Teleoceratina
and Paraceratheriidae, together with Metamynodon and Trigonias. A similar structure is observed in
the phylomorphospace, where the two first axes carry 62.1% of the total variance. PC1, which gathers
42.2% of the variance, is mainly structured by an opposition between giant Paraceratheriidae on pos-
itive values and Rhinocerotina on negative values. PC2 gathers 19.9% of the variance and mainly sep-
arates small taxa (Hyrachyus, Hyracodon, small Elasmotheriinae, Protaceratherium, Pe. profectum) to-
wards negative values from all other species towards positive values. Metamynodon and Aphelops
megalodus occupy the highest positive values along this axis.

Along PC1, shape variation is mostly related to the general orientation of the proximal part relatively
to the rest of the bone and the development and position of the trochanters (Figure 43A and Appendix
5B). Towards negative values, the proximal part of the femur is tilted medially, with a relatively flat-
tened head; a poorly developed greater trochanter tuberosity; a lesser trochanter placed directly be-
low the femoral neck and above the third trochanter along the shaft; a third trochanter strongly ex-
tended cranially and laterally. Towards positive values, the proximal part of the femur is more vertical,
with a rounded head supported by a thick neck; a greater trochanter tuberosity developed proximally
and caudally; a long lesser trochanter situated in front of the third trochanter along the shaft; a third
trochanter almost absent and reduced to a bony rugosity. Along PC2, the shape associated with nega-
tive values is long and slender, with a rounded head oriented proximo-medially; a high greater tro-
chanter tuberosity; a short lesser trochanter; a long and poorly laterally developed third trochanter.

The shape associated with positive values shows a flattened head oriented proximally; a low greater
trochanter tuberosity; a long lesser trochanter; a third trochanter developed laterally and cranially.

Like for complete bones, CS of the proximal femur carries a strong phylogenetic signal (KCS = 1.86, p <
0.01) and is highly correlated with BM (r = 0.91, p < 0.01) but not with GI-MT3 (p = 0.18) (Table 15).
Similarly, PGLS regressions indicate a significant correlation between shape and the three variables.
NNI procedure highlights that some phylogenetic uncertainties can lead to marginally non-significant
results (Table 16). The regression plot of shape against CS displays a poor fit to the regression line, with
a high dispersion of specimens. Almost all Rhinocerotina are below the regression line, only associated
with Rhinocerotinae i. s., Trigonias, Subhyracodon and Aphelops. Above the regression line, Acera-
theriini and Teleoceratina group together with Metamynodon, while Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae

plots slightly outside this central cluster. Giant Paraceratheriidae plot far away from the regression
line. They do not seem to follow the main regression trend (Figure 44A). The high dispersion of species
may underline that the different families or subfamilies do not follow the same allometric trend. A
similar observation can be done on the regression plot of shape against BM, displaying a relatively poor
fit to the regression line. Hyrachyus and Paraceratherium are isolated from most other taxa and plot
far away from the regression line. Again, almost all Rhinocerotina, situated below the line, are sepa-
rated from other species situated above the line (Figure 44B). Contrary to the results obtained on com-
plete bones, the regression plot of shape against GI-MT3 shows a more scattered dispersion of the
species. There is also no clear preferential direction shown by the overall distribution of all specimens,
which highlights a relatively poor fit to the regression line. Like for CS and BM, Rhinocerotina clearly
isolate above the regression line while almost all other species plot below the line. Although dispersed
in the plot, Aceratheriini and Teleoceratina remain relatively grouped, with Metamynodon plotting
between them (Figure 44C). Like for complete bones, shape variation associated with changes in CS
and BM values impacts similar anatomical areas: mainly the greater trochanter tuberosity, the lesser
trochanter and the cranial side of the shaft. However, the increase of robustness towards high values
is not clear. The intensity of shape variation is slightly higher for BM than CS (Figure 44A, B and Appen-
dix 5D, E). The shape changes associated with variations of GI-MT3 values mainly concern the femoral
head, the lesser and third trochanters and the insertion area of the m. vastus lateralis (Figure 44C and
Appendix 5F).

         Femur – distal part
The phylogenetic signal carried by shape data for the distal part of the femur is strong and significant
(Kmult = 1.06, p < 0.01). The distribution of the species in the NJ tree (Figure 40C) and in the phylomor-
phospace (Figure 43B) differs noticeably from those obtained on the complete bone and proximal part.
The NJ tree seems mainly patterned by an opposition between gracile and brachypodial taxa, with a
poor influence of phylogenetic relationships: only Rhinocerotina group almost all together, despite the
presence of Aceratheriini and Teleoceratina close to them. This sorting along the degree of brachypody
is also observed on the phylomorphospace (especially PC1), where the first two axes gather 64.6% of
the global variance. Along PC1, which carries 56.2% of the variance, Hyrachyus and Hyracodon plot
together around null values, close to giant Paraceratheriidae and Metamynodon. Small Elasmothe-
riinae, Trigonias and Protaceratherium are mixed with relatively gracile Aceratheriini, Rhinocerotina
and Teleoceratina while the most brachypodial taxa (Teleoceras, Chilotherium, Pleuroceros) plot to-
wards the maximal positive values, together with some Dihoplus, Ceratotherium and Diceros. PC2,
which gathers 8.2% of the variance, mainly opposes small Elasmotheriinae and Protaceratherium

towards negative values to giant Paraceratheriidae and Metamynodon towards positive values. How-
ever, no clear pattern is visible concerning other taxa between these two extremes.

Like for complete bones, the shape variation along PC1 is mainly related to the general robustness of
the bone (Figure 43B and Appendix 4C). Theoretical shape associated with negative values displays a
long and slender shaft; a narrow symmetrical trochlea developing caudally towards the condyles; sym-
metrical medial and lateral condyles. Conversely, the shape associated with positive values shows a
robust and thick shaft, compressed proximo-distally; an asymmetrical trochlea with a massive medial
lip; a medial condyle more developed than the lateral one; a protruding medial epicondyle. Along PC2,
the shape associated with negative values has a narrower shaft; a medial lip of the trochlea poorly
developed in the cranial direction; a narrow and deep V-profiled trochlear groove; medial and lateral
condyles developed in the caudal direction. Conversely, the shape associated with positive values
shows a more robust shaft; a medial lip of the trochlea more developed in the cranial direction; a wide
and shallow trochlear groove; medial and lateral condyles poorly developed in the caudal direction.

The centroid size of the distal femur carries a significant phylogenetic signal (KCS = 0.91, p < 0.01) and
is highly correlated with BM (r = 0.86, p < 0.01) but not with GI-MT3 (p = 0.32) (Table 15). However,
contrary to what is observed on the complete bone and proximal part, PGLS regressions are only sig-
nificant between shape and GI-MT3 (and marginally between shape and CS) (Table 16). The regression
plot of shape against GI-MT3 is very similar to that observed on the complete femur and indicate a
relatively good fit to the regression line. Almost all Rhinocerotina are above the regression line, to-
gether with Trigonias, Protaceratherium and Menoceras. Aceratheriini are dispersed on each side of
the line, some being mixed with Rhinocerotina. Below the regression line, Teleoceratina are grouped
together with Paraceratheriidae and Metamynodon, while Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae isolates
towards minimal values (Figure 45A). Like for complete bones, beyond a slight increase of robustness,
the shape variation associated with variations of GI-MT3 values is mainly located on both medial and
lateral supracondylar areas where inserts the m. gastrocnemius (Figure 45A and Appendix 5G). Alt-
hough marginally non-significant, the regression plot of shape against CS displays a strong similarity
with those obtained on the complete bone and proximal part, with a relatively weak fit to the regres-
sion line. An opposition is observable between almost all Rhinocerotina and Teleoceratina below the
regression line (together with Rhinocerotinae i. s.), and all other species above the line. Like in previous
results, Aceratheriini are dispersed among this central cluster, while Hyrachyus-Hyracodon and giant
Paraceratheriidae plot far away from the line at minimal and maximal CS values respectively. Similarly,
the shape variation associated with changes of CS values mainly affects the third trochanter, the cranial
side of the shaft and both medial and lateral condyles (see Appendix 6A for regression plot and shape
deformation).

          Tibia
Like for the femur, shape data obtained on the tibia carry a significant phylogenetic signal (Kmult = 1.27,
p < 0.01). The NJ tree is strongly structured by the degree of brachypody, opposing mainly Hyrachyidae
to the most brachypodial species of Teleoceratina (Figure 40D). Rhinocerotina are grouped almost all
together. Elasmotherium and Diaceratherium plot within the Aceratheriini group, whereas all other
Teleoceratina are isolated at an extremity of the tree. Paraceratherium is close to Peraceras and Rhi-
nocerotina, but also of all other Aceratheriini. The first two axes of the phylomorphospace gather
78.0% of the total variance and display a structure similar to that of the NJ tree (Figure 46A). PC1 carries
65.4% of the variance and opposes Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae towards positive values to Tele-
oceratina towards negative values. Along this axis, small Elasmotheriinae plot next to Hyrachyidae and
Hyracodontidae, together with Protaceratherium. Larger species like Elasmotherium and Paracera-
therium plot together with most of the Aceratheriini, the genus Diaceratherium and some Rhinocerot-
ina. Highly brachypodial taxa like Teleoceras, Brachypotherium, Prosantorhinus and Pleuroceros occupy
the most negative values. PC2 carries 12.6% of the variance and mainly opposes highly brachypodial
Teleoceratina towards negative values to some Rhinocerotina (with gracile genera like Stephanorhinus,
Dicerorhinus and more brachypodial ones like Ceratotherium and Dihoplus), as well as Pe. profectum
and Paraceratherium towards positive values.

Shape variation along PC1 is mostly related to the general robustness of the bone (Figure 46A and
Appendix 4D). Towards positive values, the tibia is thin and slender, with: a triangular tibial plateau
tilted in the caudal direction and showing similar surface areas for the medial and lateral articular sur-
faces; a lateral surface area highly developed in the caudal direction towards the popliteal notch; me-
dial and lateral intercondylar tubercles separated by a large gap; a small and flat tibial tuberosity asso-
ciated with a narrow and deep tibial groove; a long and narrow shaft with relatively parallel medial
and lateral edges; a distal articular surface for the fibula forming an isosceles triangle; a narrow and
asymmetrical articular surface for the astragalus, with a lateral groove deeper than the medial one; a
caudal apophysis stretched caudally. Conversely, the theoretical shape associated with negative values
is highly robust and thick, with: an irregular tibial plateau tilted medially and cranially; a medial articu-
lar surface wider than the lateral one; a lateral surface area poorly developed in the caudal direction
towards the popliteal notch; medial and lateral intercondylar tubercles separated by a narrow gap; a
strong and massive tibial tuberosity oriented laterally and associated with a wide and shallow tibial
groove; a massive diaphysis displaying a narrowing at midshaft, conferring to the bone a hourglass
aspect in cranial view; a distal articular surface for the fibula forming an equilateral triangle; a wide,
shallow and relatively symmetrical articular surface for the astragalus. Along PC2, the shape variation
mainly affects both epiphyses. Towards positive values, the tibia has high intercondylar tubercles, with

surface for the astragalus; a medial malleolus developed distally. Conversely, towards negative values,
the tibia has low intercondylar tubercles, both facing each other; medial and lateral condyles poorly
developed caudally resulting in a narrow popliteal notch; a low tibial tuberosity; a rounded and con-
cave interosseous crest; a short kidney-shaped distal articular surface for the fibula; an articular sur-
face for the astragalus with a cranio-caudally tilted general axis; a medial malleolus poorly developed
distally.

The centroid size of the tibia carries a significant although weak phylogenetic signal relatively to the
results obtained on the femur (KCS = 0.56, p = 0.01). Similarly, CS is highly correlated with BM (r = 0.72,
p < 0.01) but not with GI-MT3 (p = 0.14) (Table 15). Like for the distal part of the femur, PGLS regres-
sions are only significant between shape and GI-MT3. PGLS regression between shape and BM also
appears as marginally non-significant (Table 16). The regression plot of shape against GI-MT3 shows a
very good fit with the regression line. This plot is very similar to that obtained on the femur, with the
isolation of almost all Rhinocerotina above the regression line, only associated with Elasmotherium,
Paraceratherium and Aphelops. Below the regression line, Hyrachyidae-Hyracodontidae, small Elas-
motheriinae, Aceratheriini and Teleoceratina all form homogeneous groups separated from each other
(Figure 45B). Towards high values of GI-MT3, shape variation involves an increase of robustness and a
medio-lateral broadening of both epiphyses (Figure 45B and Appendix 5H). Most of the shape variation
is located directly under the tibial plateau on the medial and lateral sides of the shaft, but also along
all the tibial crest. The medial side of the tibial shaft is particularly affected by shape changes, especially
distally. The regression plot of shape against BM, although marginally non-significant, shares strong
similarities with that obtained on the femur. Specimens show a rather good fit to the regression line
with few outliers. Towards high BM values, there is a high dispersion of the species and a strong oppo-
sition between large Paraceratheriidae and some Teleoceratina on each side of the common slope.
Conversely, Elasmotheriinae follow a trend parallel to the common regression line (see Appendix 6B
for regression plot). The shape variation associated with changes of BM values is similar to that ob-
served for changes in GI-MT3 values, with a stronger general robustness, but also strong modifications
located under the tibial plateau. These changes are mainly located on the proximal part of the medial
side of the tibia, and distally to the tibial tuberosity. The distal part of the shaft is also affected, notably
the distal articular surface for the fibula (see Appendix 6B for shape deformation).

           Fibula
The results obtained on the fibula differ strongly from those obtained on previous bones. Although
significant, the phylogenetic signal carried by shape data is almost equal to 1 (Kmult = 0.99, p < 0.01).
The distribution of the species on the NJ tree (Figure 40D) and on the phylomorphospace (Figure 46B)
strongly differs from those obtained for the femur and the tibia. The NJ tree is mainly structured by an
opposition between Teleoceratina, Hyrachyus and Menoceras on the one hand and Rhinocerotinae i.
s., Aceratheriini, Paraceratheriidae and Rhinocerotina strongly mixed together on the other hand. The
first two axes of the phylomorphospace, gathering 76.0% of the global variance, reflect a similar struc-
ture to the NJ tree. PC1, accounting for 47.2% of the variance, opposes Hyrachyus, Menoceras and
almost all Teleoceratina in the negative part to all other species on the positive part. Rhinocerotina,
Aceratheriini and Rhinocerotinae i. s form a cluster with no obvious organisation. Paraceratherium

                      Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


plots near small taxa like Protaceratherium and Peraceras, but also near Pleuroceros and Aphelops.
PC2, which gathers 28.8% of the variance, is mainly driven by an opposition between Hyrachyus and
Menoceras towards positive values and Teleoceras towards negative values. Along this axis, while Rhi-
nocerotina plot mainly with Teleoceratina, Paraceratherium is close to small taxa like Menoceras, Ple-
siaceratherium and Protaceratherium. Aceratheriini are mixed together with Rhinocerotinae i. s., Rhi-
nocerotina and poorly brachypodial Teleoceratina.

Like for the femur and the tibia, the shape variation along PC1 is related to a change in the general
robustness of the bone (Figure 46B and Appendix 4E). The shape associated with positive values is thin
and slender with a small rounded proximal articular surface for the tibia oriented cranially; a very thin
central shaft with a sharp interosseous crest; a long distal articular surface for the tibia forming an
isosceles triangle; a medio-laterally flattened distal epiphysis; both cranial and caudal tubercles of the
lateral malleolus being oriented caudally; a symmetrical kidney-shaped articular surface for the astrag-
alus. Conversely, the shape associated with negative values is massive and thick with a large proximal
articular surface for the tibia oriented more medially; a strong central shaft with a smooth interosseous
crest; a very short distal articular surface for the tibia forming an equilateral triangle; a medio-laterally
broadened distal epiphysis; both cranial and caudal tubercles of the lateral malleolus oriented laterally;
an asymmetrical kidney-shaped articular surface for the astragalus. Surprisingly, the shape variation
along PC2 also involves a huge change in robustness associated with morphological changes of both
epiphyses. The shape associated with positive values is extremely thin and flat, with a spoon-like prox-
imal articular surface for the tibia; a straight and flat shaft; a distal epiphysis with a caudal development
conferring it a squared shape; a small rectangular articular surface for the astragalus. The shape asso-
ciated with negative values is extremely thick and massive with a large proximal articular surface for
the tibia; a strong shaft with a cranio-caudal curvature; a triangular and thick distal epiphysis; a kidney-
shaped articular surface for the astragalus.

Contrary to what is observed in other bones, the centroid size of the fibula does not carry a significant
phylogenetic signal (p = 0.22). CS is highly correlated with BM (r = 0.71, p < 0.01) but not with GI-MT3
(p = 0.17) (Table 15). Like for the distal femur and the tibia, PGLS regressions are only significant be-
tween shape and GI-MT3 (and marginally between shape and CS, like for the distal tibia) (Table 16).
However, the regression plot of shape against GI-MT3 indicates a weak fit to the regression line, with
many species plotting far away from the common slope (Figure 45C). Rhinocerotina are almost all
grouped above the regression line, while Teleoceratina are grouped below the line. Aceratheriini plot
near Rhinocerotinae i. s. and Paraceratherium in the central cluster while Hyrachyus and Menoceras
isolate towards minimal values. The shape variation associated with changes of GI-MT3 values mainly
involves morphological modifications of the caudal side of the fibula head, of the lateral part of the

shaft and of the distal epiphysis, particularly the cranial and caudal tubercles of the malleolus and the
distal articular surface for the tibia (Figure 45C and Appendix 5I). Like for the distal femur, PGLS regres-
sion between shape and CS is marginally non-significant (Table 16). The regression plot indicates a very
weak fit to the regression line. Paraceratherium appears to strongly drive the regression trend rela-
tively to all other species (see Appendix 6C for regression plot). The shape variation associated with a
higher CS involves mainly the same anatomical areas than those described for the shape variation re-
lated to GI-MT3 (see Appendix 6C for shape deformation).

          Evolution of CS values along the phylogeny
The evolution of CS values along the phylogeny for the distal femur (being that with the least amount
of missing data), complete tibia and complete fibula (Figure 47) highlights important disparities be-
tween the three bones. The distribution of CS values along the tree for the tibia is particularly distinct
from those observed on the femur and the fibula. While the lowest values are represented by Hyra-
chyidae and the highest by Paraceratheriidae on the femur, many other taxa show very low CS values
for the tibia within Rhinocerotidae (small Elasmotheriinae, Rhinocerotinae i. s., Aceratheriini, Teleoc-
eratina). On the fibula, the lowest values are not represented by Hyrachyus but by Teleoceras, whereas
most CS values for other taxa are congruent with the distribution observed for the femur.

Discussion
         Association of mass, size and gracility with bone shape
             Congruent shape variation associated with all variables

Although not significantly correlated either with CS or BM, the gracility index GI-MT3 is always signifi-
cantly correlated with shape variation. Centroid size is always significantly and highly correlated with
body mass. However, this significant relation between CS and BM should be taken carefully, as CS
values can be very different between taxa depending on the considered bone. This is particularly ob-
vious when comparing Hyrachyus and Teleoceras, displaying similar values of CS for the tibia and the
fibula, whereas the mass of the former taxon was around ten times lower than that of the latter. More-
over, these similar CS values are associated with very different bone shapes. Conversely, this relation
between CS and BM seems more relevant on the femur, where size, mass and shape vary in a more
congruent way. These differences highlight the limits of considering CS as a proxy of BM, which seems
more relevant for stylopodium than zeugopodium bones on the hind limb (see below and Chapter 5).

             Femur

On the femur, a higher size, mass, or degree of brachypody is always associated with an increase of
the bone general robustness, which is coherent with previous observations on rhinos (Prothero &
Sereno, 1982; Mallet et al., 2019; Etienne et al., 2020). Moreover, these variables affect many similar
anatomical areas though not always with the same intensity.

The femoral head is particularly affected by an increase of size, mass, or brachypody, with a higher
intensity for the two latter variables. The shape and head orientation change when these parameters
increase, the head becoming more flattened and oriented proximally. This is likely to indicate a reori-
entation of the limb (and of its rotation axis), being more vertical and placed closer from the parasagit-
tal axis of the animal when size, weight or brachypody increase. This conformation is classically asso-
ciated with a “graviportal” body plan (Gregory, 1912; Osborn, 1919) and its presence in giant Paracera-
theriidae confirm that their hip joint is oriented more distally with a femur placed close to the para-
sagittal plane (Prothero, 2013). However, such reorientation is also present among Teleoceratina in
lighter and more brachypodial species. This highlights the fact that characters classically associated
with graviportality, like the reorientation of a femoral head, can be present in taxa displaying very
different body organisations.

Along the femoral shaft, strong shape changes related to muscle insertions are distinguished, with a
maximal intensity when body mass and brachypody increase. Such changes are notably observed for
the insertion of the m. vastus lateralis (between the greater trochanter convexity and the third tro-
chanter) and on both medial and lateral supracondylar tuberosities, where insert the m. gastrocnemius

                                                   257


                     Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


and digit flexors. These powerful muscles are respectively the main extensors of the zeugopodium and
autopodium (Barone, 2010b). Such shape changes towards high body mass and high degree of brachy-
pody are coherent with more powerful muscles ensuring the propulsion and support of a higher abso-
lute weight or of a body with a lower centre of gravity. If a given mass is supported by a brachypodial
species, the position of their centre of gravity is lowered and their shorter limbs constitute shorter
lever arms. Consequently, muscles will need to produce more power to apply higher forces on these
shorter lever arms and ensure efficient movements and body support (McGhee & Frank, 1968; Hilde-
brand, 1974; Fischer & Blickhan, 2006).

On the distal epiphysis, an increase of CS, BM and GI-MT3 is also always associated with more asym-
metrical trochlea and condyles. The asymmetry of the distal epiphysis, previously observed on modern
rhinos in Chapter 3 (Mallet et al., 2019), but also in equids (Hermanson & Macfadden, 1996) and bovids
(Kappelman, 1988), is likely associated with the need to resist higher constraints exerted near the sag-
ittal plane in taller and heavier quadrupeds. Surprisingly, this asymmetry seems however poorly cor-
related with the thickening of the medial lip of the trochlea, related to body mass increase only (see
below).

             Tibia and fibula

Contrary to what is observed in the femur, shape variation in the tibia and the fibula is only significantly
correlated with the degree of brachypody, although marginal significant results were obtained with
body mass and centroid size respectively. On the tibia, an increase of both body mass and brachypody
is associated with an increase of the general robustness, as well as broader epiphyses. The tibial plat-
eau is clearly wider for high values of these parameters. The same observation can be done for the
distal epiphysis, since the contact surface with the astragalus is wider in both cases, which is coherent
with previous results obtained on this bone among Rhinocerotoidea (Etienne et al., 2020). These prox-
imal and distal broadenings likely confer a better stability of the knee and ankle joints by ensuring the
dissipation of higher constraints (due to a higher mass or a lower centre of gravity) on a larger surface
area. Moreover, most of the shape change common to high mass and brachypody is situated distally
to the proximal epiphysis and involves the tibial fossa, the tibia crest and the lateral side of the shaft.
These changes appear of higher intensity for body mass than for brachypody. These areas constitute
the insertion sites of powerful flexor muscles, respectively the m. tibialis cranialis, a foot flexor, and
the mm. biceps femoris, popliteus, semitendinosus and sartorius, all being flexors of the leg. Reinforce-
ment of insertions for flexors and extensors are congruent with the higher energy needed to move a
heavier body or to move a body with a lower centre of gravity and short legs.

                     Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


Like for the tibia, the fibula shape variation is only significantly correlated with the degree of brachy-
pody (and marginally with the centroid size). However, no clear increase of robustness is related to an
increase of brachypody. Morphological changes mainly involve the head and the proximal part of the
shaft, where insert flexor and extensor muscles for digits, as well as the distal part of the fibula, which
gives way to the tendons of these muscles and is linked to ankle bones by the collateral ligament (Bar-
one, 2010a; Fisher, Scott & Adrian, 2010). Surprisingly, variations of centroid size and degree of brachy-
pody involve similar shape changes, although these two parameters are not significantly correlated.
This indicates that convergent shape changes may be present in the fibula of taxa showing a very dif-
ferent body shape.

              Non-congruent shape variation associated with variables

Although many shape changes appear similarly related to variation of size, mass and brachypody, other
morphological modifications can be more directly related to one specific parameter. This is notably
the case of the fovea capitis on the femoral head, which appears impacted by changes of the centroid
size only. This fovea, where inserts the foveal ligament, may be almost absent in some rhino species
like the modern black rhinoceros or the giant Paraceratherium. The disappearing of the fovea might
be interpreted as the absence of this ligament (Crelin, 1988). However, a previous analysis on the ele-
phant hip indicated that this ligament can be present despite the absence of fovea and attached on
the head distal ridge (Crelin, 1988). The functional role of the foveal ligament is poorly known but
supposed to limit the abduction of the femur and prevent the dislocation of the hip joint (Crelin, 1988;
Barone, 2010b). Consequently, the shape change associated with an increase of centroid size may not
be due to the disappearing of this ligament but to the displacement of its insertion on the femoral
head, which could be related to higher constraints due to size to prevent the hip dislocation. However,
this fovea is also absent or poorly marked in non-related and lighter taxa like Diceros bicornis (Guérin,
1980; Antoine, 2002), making it hard to relate its shape and presence or absence to high body mass
only. My results do not allow to highlight precisely the morphofunctional implications of the shape
changes of this fovea, which remains to be explored deeper among quadrupeds in relation with body
proportion.

On the femur, all three trochanters are strongly affected by an increase of CS, BM or GI-MT3, but not
always similarly. An increase of mass and brachypody is associated with a lateral development of the
greater trochanter convexity, where inserts the m. gluteus minimus, an extensor of the limb (Barone,
2010b). Conversely, an increase of the centroid size affects mostly the top of the greater trochanter
tuberosity, where inserts the m. gluteus medius, considered as the main limb extensor (Barone,
2010b). A higher centroid size is associated with a lower tuberosity developed more caudally. The lat-
eral development of the convexity in heavy and brachypodial taxa and the caudal development of the

                                                   259


                     Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


tuberosity lengthen the lever arms laterally and caudally, allowing slower but more powerful exten-
sions and increasing the efficiency of muscular contractions for extending the limb (Hildebrand, 1974).
The variation of body mass and brachypody is particularly related to the variation of the lesser tro-
chanter, where inserts the m. iliopsoas, showing a distal displacement for heavier and brachypodial
species. To a lesser extent, the third trochanter, where inserts the m. gluteus maximus, displays the
same distal displacement (with shape changes only associated with variation of gracility). Both tro-
chanters are then facing each other at midshaft in heavy and brachypodial taxa, constituting longer
lever arms for muscles, a conformation often observed in heavy taxa (Hildebrand, 1974).

On the distal epiphysis, the asymmetry of the femoral trochlea is associated with a broadening of the
medial lip for high body mass only. This medial lip, also called medial trochlear ridge, is considered as
indicating the presence of a “passive stay-apparatus” in equids but also in rhinos and in some bovids,
allowing the animal to endure long periods of standing during feeding or resting times (Hermanson &
Macfadden, 1996). The apparition of this feature, that emerged independently in different lineages, is
supposed to be related to habitat (Kappelman, 1988) or to body mass (Hermanson & Macfadden,
1996). Although I did not test the hypothesis of a relation with habitat, results on fossil rhinos tend to
highlight an actual link between the development of the medial trochlear ridge and a high body mass.,
as this feature is present in all heavy taxa (in Metamynodon, large Paraceratheriidae and all heavy
Rhinocerotidae). This passive “lock” of the knee joint likely allows heavy rhinos to stand during feeding
or resting times without spending too much energy to counteract gravity constraint. Furthermore, a
similar pattern has been observed on the forelimb bone, with the bicipital groove of the humerus being
only affected by changes of the body mass (see Chapter 5). As the bicipital groove is also likely involved
in a passive-stay apparatus for the forelimb (Hermanson & MacFadden, 1992), these particularly con-
gruent results underline that the development of joint lock systems is directly related to an increase
of body mass among Rhinocerotoidea.

         Differences in stylopodium and zeugopodium shape changes with body proportions
In accordance with the second hypothesis, the comparison of patterns of shape change clearly high-
lights that the stylopodium and the zeugopodium do not follow the same trends of morphological var-
iations. Whereas the shape variation of the femur is conjointly related to size, mass and gracility, those
of the tibia and fibula appear related to the degree of brachypody only (and marginally to mass and
size respectively). Beyond the general increase of robustness underwent by the bones towards high
body mass, these strong differences tend to indicate a functional breakdown between the evolution
of the stylopodium and zeugopodium among Rhinocerotoidea, in addition with differences related to
phylogenetic relationships (see below). Hallgrímsson, Willmore, and Hall (2002) and Young and Hallgrí-
msson (2005) hypothesized an increase of variation of the limb elements along the proximo-distal axis,

                     Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


especially in quadrupeds, relating this phenomenon to postnatal processes like functional specializa-
tion under specific environmental constraints. My results tend to confirm these observations among
Rhinocerotoidea at the evolutionary level, the femoral shape varying conjointly with body proportions
while the shapes of the tibia and fibula display less correlation with body proportions except the de-
gree of brachypody. This decoupling might be related to a divergence in the role of these bones, the
femur being more involved in flexion and extension movements of both hip and leg, to ensure propul-
sion while the tibia mainly ensures weight support and gives attach for flexor and extensors muscles
of the foot (together with the fibula). The poor correlation between tibial shape and body mass varia-
tions tends to indicate that the shape of this bone is more related to the distribution of the weight in
the body (i.e. position of the centre of gravity, muscles and other organs) than to the absolute weight
of the species. These results appear as partly contradictory to what has been observed on modern
rhinos in Chapters 3 and 4, where zeugopodial shape was more directly linked to body mass than sty-
lopodium’s one (Mallet et al., 2019, 2020). However, the five modern species only represent a small
sample of the past diversity of Rhinocerotoidea, and the trend displayed by the Rhinocerotina repre-
sentatives appear as limited to this group only (see below). This underlines that, at the scale of the
whole superfamily, the degree of brachypody (and, consequently, the body mass repartition and the
position of the centre of gravity) may be a major driver of the morphological changes of the hind limb
zeugopodium. Body mass itself may have a more visible impact at a lower taxonomic level, as it have
been observed among modern rhinos as described in Chapters 3 and 4 (Mallet et al., 2019, 2020). A
similar trend can be observed on forelimb elements of the superfamily (see Chapter 5 and below).

         Modularity of the femur
Beyond this strict distinction between the stylopodium and zeugopodium, the multiple investigation
of the femur based on complete or partial bone analyses reveals that the shape variation of the whole
bone, the proximal and the distal part does not exhibit the same relation with size, mass and gracility,
confirming the third hypothesis. The shape of the proximal part appears significantly correlated with
size, mass and gracility, like that of the complete bone, but the species dispersion in the NJ trees, phy-
lomorphospaces and regression plots highlights noticeable divergences. It notably appears that small
taxa like Hyrachyidae, Hyracodontidae, small Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae i. s. share marked
morphological affinities with heavy Paraceratheriidae concerning the whole bone, but barely when
looking at their proximal part only. This tends to indicate that the proximal part of the femur undergoes
shape modification decoupled from the ones observed on the rest of the bone between these taxa.
These modifications notably concern the size and the shape of the trochanters, as well as the head
orientation. Conversely, the shape variation of the distal part of the femur is more congruent with the
ones of the tibia and fibula than with the whole femur. Like for the zeugopodial elements, it is only

                                                   261


                      Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


correlated with the degree of brachypody of the species, highlighting that the shape variation of the
complete bone is more congruent with its proximal part than its distal part. All these observations lead
me to hypothesize that proximal and distal parts of the femur as potential morphological modules, i.e.
anatomical units covarying more in themselves than with other units (Klingenberg, 2008). The congru-
ence between the shape variation of the distal femur and the tibia could indicate that the knee joint,
with the inclusion of the patella, might display a modular organisation. Similarly, the shape of the prox-
imal femur could covary with the pelvic bone, although this covariation has been proved to be weak
or inexistent on other mammal groups like equids or marsupials (Hanot et al., 2017; Martín-Serra &
Benson, 2019). All these questions remain to be addressed among modern and fossil rhinos through
relevant modularity test (Goswami & Polly, 2010; Klingenberg, 2014).

          Bone shape and phylogenetic relationships
The differences of shape variation patterns between the stylopodium and the zeugopodium may be
related to functional modifications of the limb parts. In addition, and except for the fibula (see below),
shape as well as size, mass and gracility carry a strong phylogenetic signal. The shape variation of the
complete femur remains very similar among each clade and poorly converge with morphology ob-
served in other clades. This likely underlines the influence of the evolutionary legacy on the morpho-
logical diversity of this bone. This is less clear for its distal part only as well as the tibia, for which some
taxa can share shape similarities despite being phylogenetically distant (i.e. Elasmotherium, Aphelops
and Diaceratherium). This tends to confirm previous observations among modern rhinos, indicating a
stronger effect of evolutionary relationships on the stylopodium than on the zeugopodium (see Chap-
ters 3 and 4 - Mallet et al., 2019; 2020).

The fibula appears as an exception among these bones, as its shape and its centroid size carry almost
no phylogenetic signal. Among the superfamily, only the subtribe Teleoceratina display a relative shape
homogeneity for the fibula. No clear link between the shape of the fibula and the body mass can be
seen either within the superfamily. These observations somewhat echo with previous results on mod-
ern rhinos, showing a puzzling intraspecific shape variation of this bone, exceeding the interspecific
variation (Mallet et al., 2019). In addition, the proximal and distal synostosis surfaces of the fibula are
fused with the tibia in some specimens, this fusion being potentially related to evolutionary legacy, to
the high body mass of the concerned species, or the ontogenetic stage of the individual (Antoine, 2002;
Polly, 2007). However, the fusion between these two bones can be observed on very different taxa,
such as Ceratotherium, Teleoceras or Menoceras, without any obvious trend linked to phylogeny or
body mass. This fusion can slightly modify the shape of the fibula, notably the interosseous crest and
the size and shape of the distal synostosis surface. Moreover, shape data show important differences
between the patterns of variation of the tibia and fibula, suggesting some level of independency

                     Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


between these two bones, as previously observed on modern rhinos in Chapter 4 (Mallet et al., 2020).
The relationships between shape variation, function and phylogeny thus remain unclear for the fibula
and needs further investigations.

Beyond these general trends, some groups among the superfamily follow remarkably different tenden-
cies in their shape variation. Giant Paraceratheriidae, despite their extreme size and mass, rarely pos-
sess a shape appearing as extreme relatively to other Rhinocerotoidea. In fact, their hind limb bones
show surprising proximities with some Aceratheriini, Teleoceratina or Rhinocerotina. This underlines
that these extreme proportions are not directly related to extreme shape conformations and, con-
versely, that taxa with very different body mass can share shape similarities. This proximity could be
related to the general body plan of these species: Paraceratheriidae are known to retain a “cursorial”
body plan with a high degree of gracility (Granger & Gregory, 1936; Prothero, 2013) and their limb
bones seem more constrained by this general body organisation than by constraints due to high body
weight support and propulsion.

Conversely, Teleoceratina is another group deviating from the general trend of shape variation com-
mon to the whole superfamily. Teleoceratina often constitute extremes of shape variation, particularly
the zeugopodial bones of highly brachypodial taxa like Teleoceras. This high degree of brachypody is
also encountered in phylogenetically distant genera like Pleuroceros and Chilotherium, leading to
marked shape similarities, especially on the zeugopodium. This convergent condition might be related
to particular developmental trends among these groups, leading to a shortening of the distal limb.
Such a particular condition may be involved in functional roles specific to these groups, as walking on
soft and unstable grounds (Boada-Saña, Hervet & Antoine, 2007) or even a semi-aquatic ecology, alt-
hough this hypothesis seems unlikely given recent work (MacFadden, 1998; Mead, 2000; Mihlbachler,
2003; Prothero, 2005; Clementz, Holroyd & Koch, 2008; Wang & Secord, 2020). Further investigations
on brachypodial taxa should help to clarify the origin and functional roles of this particular condition.

         Differences between fore and hind limb bones
These results on hind limb bones can be put into perspective with those obtained on forelimb bones
(see Chapter 5). It clearly appears that the stylopodial elements of the fore and hind limbs share similar
patterns of shape variation. The morphological changes of both the humerus and femur appear simul-
taneously correlated with size, mass and gracility while also carrying a strong phylogenetic signal. To-
ward high body mass, both humerus and femur display an increase of the general robustness, associ-
ated with a development of both epiphyses, the reinforcement of muscular insertions and their dis-
placement leading to lengthened lever arms. At the opposite, zeugopodial elements are only impacted
by the degree of brachypody (at the scale of the whole superfamily), related to the distribution of the


                                                   263


                     Chapter 6 – Shape variation of hind limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea


mass within the body rather to the absolute mass itself. Highly brachypodial taxa display an increase
of robustness and a development of the epiphyses as well. Some anatomical areas, like the medial and
lateral parts of the proximal epiphysis of both the radius and tibia, show a remarkably similar trend of
shape variation towards a high degree of brachypody. All these results partially invalidate the fifth
hypothesis, as differences in patterns of shape variation are stronger between the stylopodium and
zeugopodium than between the fore and hind limbs. Similar observations were partially obtained on
modern rhinos in Chapters 3 and 4 (Mallet et al., 2019, 2020) and this general trend may indicate that
serial homology between fore and hind limb elements remain strong (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005)
despite slightly different functional requirements (Henderson, 1999; Regnault et al., 2013; Panag-
iotopoulou, Pataky & Hutchinson, 2019).

However, some differences in functional role may exist between fore and hind limbs. While the body
mass and gracility index (GI-MC3 computed on the third metacarpal) were correlated in the fore limb
bones (see Chapter 5), this correlation with the same index (GI-MT3) computed on metatarsals is not
significant. In other words, the variation in gracility of the hind limb is decoupled from that of body
mass, while they are closely associated for the fore limb. This highlights differences of general organi-
sation between fore and hind limbs and supports the idea that forelimb bones among Rhinocerotoidea
may be more constrained by the weight repartition than are the hind limb ones, in association with
their involvement in other functions like ensuring a powerful propulsion (Alexander, 1985; Dutto et al.,
2006; Henderson, 2006; Regnault et al., 2013; Panagiotopoulou, Pataky & Hutchinson, 2019). Moreo-
ver, some bones might show a modular organisation, notably the ones constituting the elbow (ulna)
and knee (femur) joints (the modular condition of the tibia remaining to be tested as well). However,
in the forelimb, the trends in shape variation (as observed in morphospaces, NJ trees and regression
plots) were similar between the complete humerus and its distal part, which displayed similarities with
the proximal ulna. Conversely, on the hind limb, the shape variation of the complete femur (observed
in morphospaces, NJ trees and regression plots as well) is only congruent with its proximal part, while
that of the distal part of the femur is more congruent with the tibia one. Consequently, if morpholog-
ical modules exist in the elbow and the knee joints of Rhinocerotoidea, they may not be organised in
a homologous way, the former involving the humerus and the proximal ulna while the latter would
involve the distal femur and the tibia. These differences may be related to the distinct joint construc-
tion between the fore and hind limb. Beyond their respective bending in opposite directions, the elbow
joint constitutes a strongly constrained hinge restricted to craniocaudal movements only, formed by
the humerus, the radius and the ulna together. Conversely, the knee joint, involving the femur and the
tibia held together by powerful ligaments only, allows slight mediolateral rotations in addition to crani-
ocaudal movements (Hildebrand, 1974). Moreover, the presence of the patella, considered as

functionally homologous to the olecranon process of the ulna but being an independent bone, confers
to the knee cap a very different structure than that of the elbow joint, likely related to the observed
variations in shape patterns. Only a larger investigation of potential morphological modules and on the
construction of these joints could shed light on these questions.

Conclusion
Among Rhinocerotoidea, the shape of hind limb bones appears related to body proportions in a com-
plex way. Beyond a common increase of robustness and reinforcement of muscular insertions towards
higher body mass, the shape of stylopodial and zeugopodial bones does not follow the same patterns
of variation. In addition to a clear impact of body proportions, shape changes carry a strong phyloge-
netic signal, to a much larger extent for the femur than for the tibia and fibula. At the scale of the
superfamily, the degree of brachypody is the only tested parameter that is almost exclusively corre-
lated to the shape of the zeugopodial bones. More than the overall absolute mass, it is its distribution
in the body and the position of the centre of gravity that may drive the shape variation of hind limb
bones. Only the fibula exhibits puzzling and unclear relations between shape and variations of body
proportions. Moreover, the potential modularity of the femur, coupled with that observed on the fore-
limb, suggesting the singularity of the bones forming the knee joint, confirming the need to explore
further covariations patterns between bone parts. Finally, more differences are observed between
stylopodium and zeugopodium than between fore and hind limbs, suggesting to explore further the
origin of these differences through a more integrative approach.

General discussion
At the end of this investigation, the study of patterns of variation in the shape of long bones in Rhino-
cerotoidea delivers a complex, and often dual, signal related to body mass and body proportions in
general. On the one hand, it clearly appears that shape varies in part according to body mass among
Rhinocerotoidea. On the other hand, the diversity in bone shape in relation to body proportions high-
lights several ways to support a high body mass within the superfamily. A same body mass can also be
associated with different bone shapes and, at a broader scale, with different limb constructions de-
pending on the considered group (e.g. the paraceratheriid Juxia and the teleoceratin Teleoceras both
weight around 900-1,000 kg but have a totally different limb construction). Conversely, shape similarity
can be observed in taxa showing a distinct construction (e.g. shape similarity between giant Paracera-
theriidae and smaller Amynodontidae). This is due to the complex combination of general and more
specific trends of shape change between bones and between taxa, leading a puzzling diversity of body
construction within the superfamily (Figure 48).

         Common trends of shape variation
             Increase of robustness

Results obtained on modern (Chapters 3 and 4) and fossil (Chapters 5 and 6) rhinos coherently highlight
that an increase of body mass is associated with an increase of bone robustness on most or all long
bones, i.e. proportionally larger shaft and epiphyses. These convergent allometric trends are in perfect
accordance with conclusions obtained in other mammalian clades, from the very first observations of
Galilei (1638) almost four centuries ago to far more recent works using linear measurements (e.g. An-
derson, Hall-Martin & Russell, 1985; Bertram & Biewener, 1990, 1992; Biewener, 1990; Christiansen,
2007) or a geometric morphometric approach on the whole bone shape (e.g. Fabre et al., 2013; Martín-
Serra, Figueirido & Palmqvist, 2014; Botton-Divet et al., 2016; Hanot et al., 2018; MacLaren et al., 2018;
Serio, Raia & Meloro, 2020). It is well known that, when an object increases in size, surface area in-
creases by a power of 2 while volume (and, consequently, mass) increases by a power of 3. In this
context, as demonstrated by Alexander et al. (1979) and Schmidt-Nielsen (1984), when all proportions
of an animal are doubled, its mass (and, consequently, the vertical stress exerted on the limb bones)
increases by a factor of 8. If bones scale isometrically, their diameter would only increase by a factor
of 4, leading to an insufficient surface area to resist pressure constraint. As a consequence, the width
of the limb bone in quadrupedal mammals must scale allometrically to avoid crushing with body mass.

This leads notably to large cross-sectional areas in the limb bones of heavy animals (Schmidt-Nielsen,
1984; Christiansen, 1999). This trend has been observed in many different taxa: for example, rodents,
proboscideans, primates, with the only exception of bovids that do not scale following the same trend
(Alexander et al., 1979). My work tends to show that Rhinocerotoidea follow this rule, this trend being
clearly visible within the superfamily, even at a low taxonomic level as observed in modern rhinos.
Moreover, previous studies on bone robustness showed that many modern and fossil rhinos display
even larger bones that what would be expected following the allometric trend common to most ungu-
lates, and even larger than those of elephants relatively to their length (Prothero & Sereno, 1982;
Christiansen, 1999, 2002). These extremely robust bones in rhinos may be related to the flexed nature
of their limbs, in most representatives of the superfamily (see below), coupled with body masses
among the highest known in quadrupedal mammals. As limbs must resist extreme stress caused by a
weight of several tons, while maintaining a flexed construction, their bones must reach an exceptional
robustness to avoid crushing.

            Muscle insertions and passive-stay apparatuses

Another consequence of an increase of body mass among Rhinocerotoidea consists in the reinforce-
ment of insertion areas for muscles, particularly for extensors, like the olecranon process of the ulna
(where inserts the m. triceps brachii) and the great trochanter of the femur (where inserts the m. glu-
teus medius). As in most quadrupedal mammals, rhino’s limbs display a “Z” aspect, segments being
angled between each other. Consequently, limbs will naturally undergo flexion when submitted to
loading. Columnar limbs are one way to resist this tendency, as it leads to a vertical alignment of the
loading constraint with the limb axis and drastically less bent limbs (Hildebrand, 1974). Another way
to prevent this natural flexion is with powerful extensor muscles counteracting vertical loading (Hilde-
brand, 1974; Biewener & Patek, 2018), as observed here in modern and fossil rhinos (Chapters 4, 5 and
6). Moreover, in addition to these morphological changes linked to limb extension, some flexor inser-
tions are strongly developed in heavy rhinos (e.g. the radial tuberosity for the m. biceps brachii and
the deltoid tuberosity for the m. deltoideus). Developed flexors allow powerful limb movements in-
volved in locomotion, notably for running. Modern rhinos are able to practice gallop up to 40 km/h in
some species (Alexander & Pond, 1992; Blanco, Gambini & Fariña, 2003). Furthermore, given their
general construction, it is likely that most heavy fossil species were capable of relatively fast move-
ments, although doubts subsist for the largest genera like Paraceratherium (Paul & Christiansen, 2000).
In summary, towards high body mass, muscular insertions in rhinos modify to meet the functional
requirements of both weight support and a relatively rapid locomotion.

In addition to these reinforcements of muscular insertions toward high body mass, my results also
highlight the particular development of humeral and femoral anatomical features in heavy taxa; the

intermediate tubercle of the bicipital groove and the medial lip of the femoral trochlea, respectively
(Chapters 3, 5 and 6). This development is likely related to the presence of passive-stay mechanisms
at shoulder and knee joints. Well described in horses but absent in tapirs, these features allowing to
“lock” the limbs in the standing posture and to reduce the energy dedicated to the body stance are
suspected in rhinos as well. However, their presence has never been strictly demonstrated (Herman-
son & MacFadden, 1992; Hermanson & Macfadden, 1996). These features, which were regarded as
associated to a BM increase, may also be related to locomotor ecology, as they are often encountered
in relatively cursorial taxa living in open environments (Kappelman, 1988; Janis et al., 2012). My results
indicate a clear development of these humeral and femoral areas towards high body mass, both in
modern (Chapter 3) and fossils taxa (Chapters 5 and 6), and therefore suggest the existence of passive-
stay apparatuses in some heavy Rhinocerotoidea. The presence of such features in rhinos would be
coherent with their general constitution meeting both requirements for weight support and relatively
fast locomotion. Moreover, the presence of these apparatuses in horses but not in tapirs (Hermanson
& MacFadden, 1992; Hermanson & Macfadden, 1996) further suggests a functional origin linked both
to weight and locomotion rather than an evolutionary legacy common to all Perissodactyla. The pres-
ence of passive-stay apparatuses in modern rhinos remains to be clearly asserted in vivo observations
regarding their locomotion and by dissections to compare the knee of rhinos with that of horses, pos-
sessing this locking feature.

All these observations indicate that along their evolutionary history, from a lightly build plesiomorphic
condition without passive-stay apparatuses, Rhinocerotoidea have underwent common skeletal
changes directly related to weight bearing, modifying deeply their appendicular skeleton but without
obliterating all its “cursorial” aspects (e.g. flexed limbs, powerful flexor muscles, relatively elongated
autopodium).

          Differences in shape patterns between and within limbs
Beyond these trends common to the whole superfamily and to the six studied bones, the association
of body mass with shape also differs between and within the limbs. In quadrupedal mammals, fore
and hind limbs do not support the same proportion of the total mass (e.g. around 60 and 40%, respec-
tively, in elephant; Henderson, 2006) and do not fulfil the same locomotor function (brake and propul-
sion, respectively; Dutto et al., 2006). Consequently, it is likely that the influence of body mass should
be higher on the forelimb than on the hind limb, as braking involves higher pressure forces on the
forelimb in heavier animals (Pandy et al., 1988; Granatosky et al., 2018). This effect might be even
stronger on taxa with a particularly large head sometimes wearing heavy horns like rhinos. My results
highlight a stronger link between body mass and shape variation in the forelimb than in the hind lomb
among modern rhinos (and, at a lesser extent, at the superfamily level), particularly when looking at

                                                     302


                             Chapter 7 – General discussion and perspectives


integration patterns. This suggests a closer link between body mass and shape covariation within the
forelimb, due to the need to resist higher constraints due to weight support (Chapter 4).

However, differences in shape variation are far more marked between the stylopodium and zeugopo-
dium than between the fore and hind limbs. Results obtained on modern rhinos highlight that the
shape of the stylopodium is strongly related to phylogenetic relationships (Chapter 3), and highly co-
variant between the fore and hind limb (Chapter 4), likely due to shared developmental trajectories
related to their serial homology (Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall, 2002). Conversely, the influence of
body mass on the shape variation of the stylopodium appears secondary. At the superfamily level, the
shape of the stylopodium in most Rhinocerotoidea follow a strong common trend of variation inti-
mately related to phylogeny as well (Chapters 5 and 6). All these observations lead to the conclusion
that morphological changes related to functional factors like weight support do not overcome those
related to historical factors in the stylopodium of Rhinocerotoidea.

My observations on modern rhinos indicate that the shape of the zeugopodium is much more related
to body mass, notably in the forelimb (see above), than to historical factors. Yet, at the scale of the
superfamily, it is the degree of brachypody that appears more strongly associated with the zeugopodial
shape than with the body mass itself (Chapters 5 and 6). As it is related to the relative length of the
limb, the degree of brachypody can be interpreted as a proxy of the vertical position of the centre of
gravity for a given species: the more brachypodial the species, the lower its centre of gravity (Hender-
son, 1999, 2006), as observed for example in hippos (Coughlin & Fish, 2009). The influence of body
mass itself seems more visible at a lower taxonomic level, as observed in modern rhinos. The influence
of the evolutionary history remains present, each group retaining some distinct morphological fea-
tures. The relation between shape and evolutionary legacy yet appears secondary, since phylogenet-
ically distant taxa can display convergent body proportions and, consequently, a convergent zeugopo-
dial shape (i.e. Elasmotherium, Amphicaenopus and Metamynodon; Pleuroceros, Chilotherium and Tel-
eoceras). This link between body mass and zeugopodial shape is more marked on the forelimb than on
the hind limb, which seems coherent with previous observations regarding the higher impact of body
mass on the former than on the latter (see above) (Figure 49).

All these observations are coherent with previous works highlighting distinct trends of shape variation
between the stylopodium and zeugopodium related to body mass (Bertram & Biewener, 1992; Fabre
et al., 2013). Moreover, this higher influence of functional factors on the zeugopodium than on the
stylopodium is in accordance with the framework developed by Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall (2002),
hypothesising that, given the proximo-distal development of the limbs (from girdle to autopodium),
shape variation is more likely to accumulate in distal elements than in proximal ones under external

constraints (e.g. weight bearing, locomotor substrate) (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005; Hanot et al., 2017,
2018). Moreover, the degree of brachypody is computed on metapodial measurements: the anatomi-
cal and developmental proximity with metapodial elements may be another reason why the shape of
the zeugopodium correlates more with brachypody than does the stylopodial shape. Moreover, given
the accumulation of variation along a proximo-distal gradient in quadruped limbs (Hallgrímsson,

Willmore & Hall, 2002; Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005), it may be useful to estimate the degree of brachy-
pody not only on a single bone but using the relative proportions of all limb segments.

          The particular case of the fibula
Among the six studied bones, the fibula clearly appears as the one showing the most puzzling patterns
of shape variation. Its morphology is strongly dominated by intraspecific variation in modern rhinos,
with a reduced influence of the evolutionary legacy (except in the genus Rhinoceros – Chapter 3) and
it is the only bone for which the degree of shape covariation with adjacent bones (femur and tibia) is
higher when the effect of size is removed (Chapter 4). Moreover, investigations in fossil rhinos highlight
surprising proximity between taxa with strongly different body constructions, such as Hyrachyidae and
Teleoceratina (Chapter 6). The fusion of the fibula with the tibia, hardly associated with specific factors
(e.g. age, species, body mass) is even more confusing (Chapter 6). These results question the functional
role of this bone and the nature of the constraints related to its shape variation. As this bone is reduced
or absent in many ungulates (Polly, 2007; Barone, 2010a), the functional role of the fibula and its po-
tential link with weight bearing has been poorly explored, except in humans (where the fibula does
support part of the body mass – Lambert, 1971; Takebe et al., 1984). The persistence of this bone in
all rhinos, maybe related to evolutionary legacy (tapirs, which are sister-taxa of rhinos, retain a fibula
while it almost disappears in equids), likely indicates a potential functional role. Among Rhinocero-
toidea, despite a contact between the femur and the fibula in some fossil species (Antoine, 2002), the
most of the body mass seems supported by the tibial plateau in the knee joint. Consequently, main
functional roles of the fibula in rhinos are likely to allow the insertion of flexors and extensors of the
autopodium, as well as to ensure the ankle joint stability with the lateral malleolus (Barone, 2010a).
As these functions involve only limited areas of the bone, it is possible that a large part of the fibula is
poorly constrained, leading the shape to vary relatively independently from body mass variation or
evolutionary legacy. The fibula might be compared to what is observed in some vestigial organs, known
to be less constrained by functional factors and to vary independently from adjacent organs (Walker‐
Larsen & Harder, 2001).

          Limitations of the study
             Sampling

Although this work includes hundreds of modern and fossil specimens, some limits may be linked to
the sampling representativity. Many crucial information was often lacking for modern rhinos in most
institutions, like age, sex, locality and, most importantly, body mass (see below). Subspecies are known
for four modern rhinos (two for C. simum, seven or eight for Dc. bicornis and three for Ds. sumatrensis
and R. sondaicus – Groves, 1972; Groves & Kurt, 1972; Laurie, Lang & Groves, 1983; Hillman-Smith &

Groves, 1994; Groves & Leslie, 2011) but subspecific attribution was almost often missing too, except
for some C. simum specimens. Consequently, the potential shape patterns associated with all these
variables could not been addressed. Unfortunately, these limitations seem difficult to overcome given
the numerous threats facing most rhino species nowadays. Habitat destruction, intense poaching and
diseases led to a drastic reduction of the wild rhino populations and led most species to the brink of
extinction (Hillman-Smith & Groves, 1994; Groves, Fernando & Robovský, 2010; Dinerstein, 2011;
Groves & Leslie, 2011; Goossens et al., 2013; Mays et al., 2018). In this context, sampling of studies on
modern rhinos can hardly be drastically extended, particularly for Ds. sumatrensis and R. sondaicus,
each currently represented by less than one hundred living individuals.

Other sampling biases are noticeable for fossil rhinos. Although some limited taphonomic problems
have been overcome using partial templates (Chapters 5 and 6), many specimens in the collections are
too damaged or uncomplete to be included in shape analyses (less than half of all the bones scanned
during my fieldtrips could be analysed). This prevented me to include some taxa constituting relevant
occurrences of high body mass in poorly represented clades (e.g. hind limb bones of Paramynodon and
Cadurcodon for Amynodontidae, or the elasmothere Iranotherium totally absent from my analysis). If
some taxa are known from hundreds of specimens, others are only known by poorly preserved long
bones or even by craniodental remains only, making it impossible to include them in such analyses.
This is notably the case of some early Rhinocerotidae (e.g. Epiaceratherium, Molassitherium,
Ronzotherium, Mesaceratherium – Becker, 2009; Becker, Antoine & Maridet, 2013; Tissier & Becker,
2018; Tissier, Antoine & Becker, 2020) or many representatives of Elasmotheriinae (e.g. Kenyatherium,
Bugtirhinus, Caementodon – (Antoine, 2002). Finally, despite the diversity encountered in Rhinocero-
toidea, relatively few independent occurrences of high body mass can be detected. Heavy mass (i.e.
several hundreds of kilograms) arises at least in two tribes of Amynodontidae (Metamynodontini and
Cadurcodontini – Averianov et al., 2017; Tissier et al., 2018) and in one subfamily of Paraceratheriidae
(Paraceratheriinae – Wang et al., 2016). Within Rhinocerotidae, occurrences of high body mass are
present in both subfamilies (Elasmotheriinae and Rhinocerotinae). Numerous taxa within Rhinocerot-
inae display a high body mass (among Aceratheriini, Teleoceratina and Rhinocerotina) but these oc-
currences can hardly be considered as totally independent as most of the members of this group
weight at least several hundreds of kilograms (even early representatives – Becker, 2003, 2009; Becker
et al., 2009). A similar observation can be done for high brachypody, whose occurrences arise mainly
within the subfamily Rhinocerotinae (in taxa like Pleuroceros, Chilotherium and most Teleoceratina –
Figure 48) and can therefore be considered as not totally independent. Consequently, the trends of
shape variation observed in Rhinocerotoidea and related to an increase of body mass should be rein-
forced by the consideration of other independent occurrences of heavy mass outside of the group (see

Perspectives below). Replicated events are needed to avoid spurious correlations between traits (like
body mass and bone shape) that are evolving independently (Felsenstein, 1985; Maddison & FitzJohn,
2015; Uyeda, Zenil-Ferguson & Pennell, 2018).

             Body mass and centroid size

Body mass, which is a central parameter in my study, is a variable that must be considered carefully.
Its value is highly variable in extant species depending on the age, sex, physical condition and environ-
ment of the specimen. Body mass is barely available in institutional databases for large animals like
extant rhinos, only a few specimens being weighted after death – weight being difficult to measure for
large animals and subject to additional variations due to loss of water or body decomposition. Ranges
of body mass in modern rhinos are subject to impressive variations along lifetime and between males
and females (up to 30-40% in C. simum – Zschokke & Baur, 2002). Moreover, demographic studies of
fossil assemblages (e.g. Menoceras, Aphelops, Teleoceras) likely indicate broad ranges of weight in
some extinct species due to ontogeny and sexual dimorphism (Guérin, 1980; Fortelius & Kappelman,
1993; Mead, 2000; Mihlbachler, 2005; Prothero, 2005; Mihlbachler, 2007; Chen et al., 2010; Prothero,
2013). Many methods of body mass estimation have been developed for decades using craniodental
and postcranial measurements (e.g. Talbot & McCulloch, 1965; Anderson, Hall-Martin & Russell, 1985;
Legendre, 1989; Scott, 1990; Damuth & MacFadden, 1990; Mendoza, Janis & Palmqvist, 2006; Campi-
one & Evans, 2012; Tsubamoto, 2014; Hopkins, 2018) but very few have included rhinos, which do not
seem to follow the same allometric trend as other ungulates (Prothero & Sereno, 1982). In this context,
the alternative use of the centroid size of long bones was necessary to overcome lacking or unprecise
body mass data – as well as a potential circular reasoning using mass estimation computed on the
circumference of bones included in the shape study. Along this study, the centroid size has proven to
be a relevant (but sometimes loose) proxy to estimate body mass in both modern and fossil rhinos –
at least based on the masses available for the various taxa and based on diverse types of measure-
ments – confirming similar results obtained on their tarsal bones (Etienne et al., 2020) and in other
mammals (Ercoli & Prevosti, 2011; Cassini, Vizcaíno & Bargo, 2012). Since centroid size is computed on
the distances between each landmark and the centroid of the object, it is almost proportional to the
object volume when a high number of landmarks is used, making it vary congruently with body mass
as well (see above). However, this approach suffers some limits, notably since all bones are not corre-
lated similarly with body mass. If results obtained on the stylopodium are robust (possibly confirming
the relevance of body mass estimation methods using stylopodium circumferences – Anderson, Hall-
Martin & Russell, 1985; Campione & Evans, 2012), they are less pertinent on the zeugopodium, espe-
cially on the fibula, for which a single centroid size value can be associated with very different body
masses and bone shapes in highly distinct taxa (Chapter 6). This link may also be even poorer in highly

brachypodial species having a strongly modified zeugopodium. More investigations on other mammal
groups are needed to test further the link between the centroid size of limb bones and body mass in
order to use it more broadly in shape studies.

         Potential influence of ecology
While body proportions and evolutionary history are associated with bone shape variation, the latter
might also be related to other factors. Rhinocerotoidea are known as a group showing a high diversity
of ecologies throughout their evolution, with various feeding habits (browsers, grazers, mixed-feed-
ers), and habitats (from open cold steppes, temperate plains and hot savannas to dense tropical for-
ests) encountered in various and non-related groups (Guérin, 1980; Prothero & Schoch, 1989;
Prothero, 2005, 2013). However, the role of ecology is not directly addressed in this study, mainly
because ecological data for both modern and fossil rhinos can be highly spurious. Ecological affinities
of modern rhinos are intimately intricated with phylogenetic relationships, making it hard to untangle
their respective link with bone shape. Furthermore, historical ranges and habitats of modern rhinos
have been drastically reduced and modified under human pressure (Hillman-Smith & Groves, 1994;
Dinerstein, 2011; Groves & Leslie, 2011; Rookmaaker & Antoine, 2012), leading to potential bias when
trying to interpret bone shape in regard to current ecologies. Palaecological studies of extinct rhinos
are often focused on species known from extensive fossil records (e.g. Prothero & Sereno, 1982; Wil-
cots, 1992; MacFadden, 1998; Mead & Wall, 1998; Mead, 1999, 2000; Costeur et al., 2012; Boeskorov,
2012; Wang & Secord, 2020) while ecologies of less-documented taxa remain poorly known.

Nevertheless, the limb morphology appears related to ecological factors in other mammals (e.g. Harris
& Steudel, 1997; Fabre et al., 2014; Martín-Serra, Figueirido & Palmqvist, 2014; Martín‐Serra et al.,
2015; Botton-Divet et al., 2016, 2018; MacLaren et al., 2018; Serio, Raia & Meloro, 2020). As regards
rhinos, previous studies tended to indicate a poor correlation between limb construction and ecology
(Guérin, 1980; Eisenmann & Guérin, 1984). My preliminary observations tend to show that the role of
ecology in shaping limb bones, if it exists, is not the main driver of the shape variation in rhinos. For
example, the large elasmothere Elasmotherium, the short-legged Teleoceras and the extant white
rhino C. simum are generally all considered as highly specialised animals living in open environments
(Mihlbachler, 2003; Prothero, 2005; Dinerstein, 2011; Kosintsev et al., 2018). Despite similar ecological
affinities, my results highlight that their limb bones do not show a convergence towards a common
shape (Elasmotherium retains long and slender limbs like other Elasmotheriinae, while C. simum does
not reach the extreme brachypodial condition displayed by Teleoceras). Similarly, based on morpho-
logical considerations (e.g. short limbs, barrel-like body), it has been assumed that taxa like Teleoceras
and Metamynodon could have been semi-aquatic like modern hippos, although this hypothesis is not
consensual (MacFadden, 1998; Wall & Heinbaugh, 1999; Mead, 2000; Mihlbachler, 2003; Clementz,

Holroyd & Koch, 2008; Wang & Secord, 2020). Although this hypothesis has not been tested here,
results indicate no convergent shape between these taxa that could be related to a similar lifestyle.

          Potential influence of ontogeny
Developmental constraints likely play a role in shaping limb bones, although this aspect is not directly
addressed in this study. Personal observations on modern rhinos indicate a marked shape variation
between juvenile and adult specimens, the formers having larger epiphyses relatively to the shaft lead-
ing to a general hourglass shape (Figure 50). This has been observed on all six bones, tending to indicate
that the diaphysis enlarges more than the epiphyses during growth. This is coherent with the increase
of robustness previously described (see above “Common trends of shape variation”), the shaft needing
to be broader to support body weight as the specimen grows. Moreover, I have observed a similar
tendency in different fossil taxa displaying juvenile specimens (e.g. Teleoceras, Coelodonta, Hispan-
otherium). These observations tend to indicate a potential allometric trend at the ontogenetic level
showing similarities with that observed at the static level in adult specimens (i.e. increase of robustness
and large epiphyses towards high body mass) (Chapter 3). These different allometric scales remain to
be directly compared and quantified (Klingenberg, 2016).

At the scale of the superfamily, morphological differences in long bones may also be related to differ-
ences in developmental trends and rhythms between taxa (i.e. heterochrony – McKinney & McNa-
mara, 1991; Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2009; McNamara, 2012). The degree of
brachypody could particularly be related to a reduced or accelerated growth of some bones in brachy-
podial and gracile taxa, respectively. Developmental heterochrony has been previously suggested in
Teleoceras major to explain sexual dimorphism (Mead, 2000). Such different developmental rhythms
are likely to exist also between species. Coupled with body support and evolutionary legacy, these
factors could be strongly related to the diversity of bone shape among Rhinocerotoidea.

           Beyond graviportality
Finally, this works allows to question the concept of graviportality and its application to Rhinocero-
toidea. It appears that the shape of the limb bones in Rhinocerotoidea modifies under loading stress
while still carrying a strong phylogenetic signal. The general construction of the rhino limbs remains
however largely the same across all the superfamily. When considering the morphofunctional frame-
work of Gregory (1912) and Osborn (1929) and the classic criteria associated with graviportality (i.e.
long stylopodium and short autopodium, body mass of several hundreds of kilograms, columnar limbs,
large and strong bones, large feet, slow pace), no deep architectural breakdown towards this peculiar
limb organisation has been observed in rhinos. The high body mass and the increase in bone robust-
ness (and potentially the enlarged feet although this criterion is relative – Panagiotopoulou, Pataky &
Hutchinson, 2019) are almost the only graviportal features encountered in the superfamily. The mor-
phology of the elbow and knee joints indicate that almost all taxa retain flexed limbs with no conver-
gence towards a strictly columnar organisation. Only large Paraceratheriidae display straighter limbs
although they are not totally columnar (elbow and knee joints likely remaining flexed) (Fortelius &
Kappelman, 1993; Paul, 1997; Paul & Christiansen, 2000). The lengthening of the stylopodium rela-
tively to the other limb elements is far from being clear except in highly brachypodial species (but more
likely to a shortening of the zeugopodium). The reduction of the autopodium elements (i.e. degree of
brachypody) appears associated with various body mass values and not only the highest ones (Chap-
ters 5 and 6). Conversely, the reduction of the autopodium is not always marked in heavy taxa, as
observed in Elasmotherium and Paraceratherium (Chapters 5 and 6). Although not directly studied
here, the gait of rhinos seems also relatively conservative: modern rhinos are able to gallop and given

the similar general construction of the limbs in large fossil taxa, it is likely that most of them could
reach a relatively fast pace (Paul & Christiansen, 2000).

The detailed study of shape variation in rhinos allows to highlight morphological changes linked to the
support and propulsion of heavy weight that are nearly absent from this classical framework. The con-
sideration of the shape of the whole bones highlights morphological changes of paramount importance
that are complementary to those underlined by linear measurements (e.g. relative length and angle of
the olecranon process or the femoral head). The increase of robustness for all long bones is the most
obvious morphological modification related to an increase of body mass in Rhinocerotoidea. Moreo-
ver, the shape changes observed in the zeugopodial elements relatively to the degree of brachypody
(and, consequently, to the vertical position of the centre of gravity) shed light on the impact of mass
on this segment. The classical framework of Gregory and Osborn underlines that the relative length of
this central segment is poorly modified between cursorial and graviportal taxa (Gregory, 1912; Osborn,
1929) (see Figure 1 in Chapter 1). My results highlight that the zeugopodial shape however is deeply
modified between light and heavy rhinos.

One group among the superfamily is particularly challenging the concept of graviportality: the
Paraceratheriidae. It has been observed since their discovery that giant rhinos like Paraceratherium
challenge the classic definition of graviportality even more than other rhinos (Granger & Gregory,
1936; Fortelius & Kappelman, 1993). Particularly, they do not show the relative reduction of the auto-
podium length or the fully columnar limbs expected for such big quadrupeds. Moreover, the ratio “hu-
meral length over radial length” is below 1 in Juxia and Urtinotherium while above 1 for Hyrachyus and
Hyracodon, making Paraceratheriidae close to more gracile taxa such as modern equids (ratio < 1). This
ratio is also different from that observed in other rhinos (e.g. above 1 for modern rhinos). Conversely,
the ratio “femoral length over tibial length” is higher in Paraceratherium (1.4) than in Hyrachyus (1.1)
and modern horses (1.1). This ratio on the hind limb is close to that observed in modern rhinos (1.5 in
C. simum, 1.4 in Dc. bicornis) (personal computations). These ratios coupled with my results show that
Paraceratheriidae appear to follow a different trend of shape variation than the rest of the superfamily.
Contrary to in other Rhinocerotoidea, the shape of their stylopodium seems more affected by func-
tional factors (i.e. weight support) while zeugopodial shape is poorly modified and retain a plesiomor-
phic aspect (although relatively slightly more robust) close to small taxa like Hyrachyidae and Hyraco-
dontidae (Chapters 5 and 6). This conservative shape of the zeugopodium in paraceratheres is more
marked on the forelimb than on the hind limb, which would appear in contradiction with the forelimb
supporting a higher part of the total weight. It is therefore possible that the hind limb in giant Paracera-
theriidae supports more weight due to a slightly sloped backbone (Prothero, 2005), an uncommon
feature among Rhinocerotoidea which mostly display a relatively horizontal spine. This remains

hypothetical, as skeletal reconstructions for these animals are not consensual (Paul & Christiansen,
2000; Qiu & Wang, 2007; Prothero, 2013). It is also possible that the forelimb of Paraceratheriidae
hardly follows the general trend common to most Rhinocerotoidea, maybe due to strong developmen-
tal or evolutionary constraints. All these features highlight both morphological changes linked to mass
support (e.g. robustness of the stylopodium, shortening of the tibia) and the persistence of a cursorial
construction close to that of small Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae. This unusual architecture tackles
the classical opposition between “cursorial” and “graviportal” categories, Paraceratheriidae appearing
to show features characterizing both categories simultaneously.

As Rhinocerotoidea hardly display the anatomical criteria classically associated with graviportality, two
possible assessments arise: either Rhinocerotoidea should not be considered graviportal, or the gravi-
portal framework is too limited to describe the diverse conditions by which species adapt to heavy
weight. My study shows unambiguously that morphological changes (increase of robustness, larger
epiphyses) linked to a heavy body mass – one of the highest in terrestrial mammals – arise across the
evolutionary history of rhinos. The limitations of the historical framework of Gregory (1912) and Os-
born (1929) may be related to the archetypal groups used to define graviportality (and cursoriality).
Graviportality was mainly defined using elephants as a model, coupled with extinct groups showing a
similar limb architecture like Dinocerata (Osborn, 1900). However, it is not sure that all anatomical
features potentially linked to a heavy weight encountered in these groups are characteristic of a gen-
eral trend shared by all quadrupedal taxa showing an increase of body mass. Most Proboscidea retain
poorly modified limbs, with no reduction of the digit number, no radio-ulnar and tibio-fibular fusion,
and other particular features like the ulna supporting the humerus in the elbow joint (contrary to the
condition in most ungulates, where the humerus is supported only by the radius) or the symmetrical
femoral trochlea (Fujiwara, 2009; Janis et al., 2012; Larramendi, 2016). Morphofunctional investiga-
tions highlight that the limb structure and motion in Proboscidea is atypical compared to in most mam-
malian quadrupeds, including heavy ones (Ren et al., 2010). Except in their general increase of robust-
ness, Rhinocerotoidea show no clear convergence of shape or limb construction towards that of Pro-
boscidea, even in extremely large taxa like Paraceratheriidae. Most criteria associated with graviportal-
ity in elephants are not universally shared in heavy quadrupeds. Therefore, the classic graviportal
framework should be considered with caution. It may be more relevant to search what the features
repeatedly encountered within diverse taxa showing a high body mass are before defining a general
concept such as graviportality. As there are likely multiple ways to sustain a heavy weight, graviportal-
ity should only be used after deciphering the repeated features potentially associated to it and the
special adaptations limited to a particular group.

Perspectives
         Girdles, autopodium and patella
This investigation of the relation between body mass and bone shape in Rhinocerotoidea could be the
first step for a morphological exploration of the influence of weight on other limb elements. Girdle
bones (scapula and pelvis) and autopodium elements are respectively the most proximal and distal
segments of the limbs. Following the developmental hypothesis of Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall
(2002), suggesting an increase of morphological variation from proximal to distal limb elements, the
shape of girdles should show poorer correlation with body mass variation. Investigations on tapirs yet
indicate slight modifications of the shape of the scapula in heavy species (MacLaren & Nauwelaerts,
2016). Moreover, very different shapes are observed among Rhinocerotoidea, from oval scapulae in
small cursorial Hyrachyidae and Hyracodontidae to squared ones in some Amynodontidae and Teleoc-
eratina (Scott & Jepsen, 1941; Wall & Hickerson, 1995; Prothero, 2005; Bai et al., 2017) suggesting
noticeable scapular changes link to body mass in rhinos as well. Shape variation of the pelvic bone is
poorly known in perissodactyls. Results obtained on modern horses indicate a poor influence of body
mass on its shape variation and a poor covariation with other limb elements (Hanot et al., 2017, 2018).
As pelvis is united to the backbone while the scapula is only maintained by muscles in ungulates, it is
likely that the latter may be less constrained by adjacent bones than the former.

Conversely, autopodium elements can vary not only in relation to weight but also with locomotion,
ecology and environment (Warner et al., 2013). If metapodial proportions have been indirectly consid-
ered here through the gracility index, their shape variation and its relation with body mass remain to
be addressed in a global morphometric approach. In horses, despite a small effect of body mass on the
covariation of the limb elements, the autopodium (especially the metapodials) does not follow the
developmental hypothesis of Hallgrímsson, Willmore & Hall (2002), likely due to the cursorial special-
isation of this group (Hanot et al., 2017, 2018). Results obtained on the forelimb of tapirs seem to
confirm the double influence of body mass and locomotor ecology on the shape of the autopodium
elements (MacLaren & Nauwelaerts, 2017). Investigation on the talus and the calcaneum of Rhinoce-
rotoidea highlights a link between body mass and bone shape, although not as strong as expected,
suggesting a significant influence of other factors on the morphology (environment, substrate, evolu-
tionary legacy) (Etienne et al., 2020 – see General appendix). Given these results and the influence of
the degree of brachypody on the other limb segments (Chapters 5 and 6), it is very likely that the
autopodium in Rhinocerotoidea should show a great diversity of shape in relation with mass, substrate
and locomotor ecology.

In addition, the consideration of the patella in the hind limb appears as a crucial complementary ap-
proach to understand the shape variation of the knee joint. The powerful leg extensors and knee liga-
ments inserted on the patella confer to this sesamoid bone a functional role analogous to that of the
olecranon tuberosity of the ulna (Hildebrand, 1974; Barone, 2010b). Moreover, its involvement in the
passive-stay apparatus of the knee (present in horses and likely in rhinos but not in tapirs – see above)
suggests that the patella plays a major functional role in the hind limb architecture (Hermanson &
Macfadden, 1996). Consequently, the patella may display shape modifications linked to body mass and
to highly covary with other hind limb bones, particularly the femur on which the patella slides.

            Joints and modularity
The exploration of the morphological integration showed that limb bones strongly covary in modern
rhinos (Chapter 4). However, investigation of partial bones has highlighted unexpected differences in
shape patterns between complete and partial bones (Chapters 5 and 6). These results should foster
future tests on the modular construction of limb elements, not only through a bone by bone approach
but also on specific parts of the bone. A module is defined as an anatomical unit covarying more in
itself than with other units (Klingenberg, 2008). Given that the epiphyses and diaphysis develop from
different ossification centres and that some bones are related to each other through strong joint caps
(Barone, 2010b,a), adjacent epiphyses may covary more strongly between them than with their re-
spective shaft (or their opposite epiphysis on the same bone), the joint therefore constituting a mor-
phological module. Broadly explored in cranial elements, morphological modularity is poorly investi-
gated in mammalian limb bones (Young & Hallgrímsson, 2005; Wagner, Pavlicev & Cheverud, 2007;
Goswami, Weisbecker & Sánchez‐Villagra, 2009; Diogo et al., 2018; Montoya‐Sanhueza, Wilson &
Chinsamy, 2019). The modularity of the limb bones in rhinos, as well as its relation with body mass, is
therefore virtually unknown, despite a potentially crucial role in the construction of the appendicular
skeleton.

            Inner structure of long bones
As my study focuses on the external shape variation of long bones, it provides no information about
the potential internal structural changes linked to body mass. The inner structure of bones is known
to be highly influenced by functional factors, like body mass and locomotor ecology (Turner, 1998;
Robling, Castillo & Turner, 2006) and evolutionary legacy (Cubo et al., 2005). Consequently, heavy
quadrupeds are likely to present a particular inner structure directly linked to the higher loading con-
straints exerted on bones. Moreover, bone is a living tissue that constantly remodels under mechanical
constraints to maintain the functional structure of the body (i.e. accommodation – Lanyon, Magee &
Baggott, 1979; Lanyon et al., 1982; Hadjidakis & Androulakis, 2006). In addition to a higher osseous

mass (Christiansen, 1999, 2002), heavy quadrupeds display thicker trabeculae (Doube et al., 2011), a
broader cortex and a filling of the medullar cavity by spongious bone (Wall, 1983; Oxnard, 1993; Hous-
saye et al., 2016; Houssaye, Fernandez & Billet, 2016). All these features are likely to play a role in
dissipating more efficiently high loading stress due to a heavy mass (Warner et al., 2013). The inner
structure of long bones in modern rhinos is almost unknown, and rare works concerning their micro-
anatomy highlighted particular features, like the filling of the medullary cavity as in semi-aquatic hip-
pos, a marked reinforcement of the cortex at midshaft and thin trabeculae (Wall, 1983) (Figure 51).
Bone density of rhinos has also been described as “slightly different” from that of other heavy mam-
mals by Alexander and Pond (1992) but without more explanation (Christiansen, 2002). Consequently,
given the range of body mass and the ecological differences between the five modern rhinos (e.g.
Asiatic rhinos being more aquatic than African ones), a microanatomical exploration of the long bones
could highlight modifications of the inner structure related to weight and ecology. A similar approach
on fossil taxa would likely complete the external approach developed here and highlight particular
modifications of the inner structure linked to the support of an extreme weight by comparing distinct
high taxa searching for similar or dissimilar inner structures (e.g. Paraceratheriidae and Elasmothe-
riidae) or the microanatomical modifications associated with an extreme brachypody (e.g. Teleocer-
atina).

         Investigation in other heavy taxa
Finally, the approach of the present study could be enhanced by the inclusion of other taxa showing
independent occurrences of high body mass. This could allow to test if convergent or divergent mor-
phological changes arise under a similar increase in weight in a larger sample comprising a greater
number of replicated increases in body mass (see above “Limitations of the study”). Convergence to-
wards a high body mass can be observed in other clades within Perissodactyla: Tapiroidea (Lophiodon-
tidae weighting more than 2,000 kg – Robinet et al., 2015), Brontotherioidea (more than 2,000 kg –
Damuth & MacFadden, 1990) and Chalicotherioidea (more than 1,500 kg – Guérin, 2012) (see Figure 3
in Chapter 1). These convergent high body masses occur in taxa showing a great diversity of morphol-
ogies and proportions. Lophiodontidae display a general body construction similar to tapirs’ but with
limb bones showing marked similarities with those of quadrupedal chalicotheres (e.g. rounded head
and symmetrical trochlea on the femur – Figure 51) (Holbrook, 2009). Similarly, large brontotherids,
despite a general aspect close to rhinos’, show marked anatomical differences in their appendicular
skeleton (e.g. extreme development of the greater tubercle of the humerus, relatively slender femur
with a symmetrical trochlea – Figure 51) (Osborn, 1929). Moreover, chalicotheriids are split in two
subfamilies showing, in addition to a heavy mass, a facultative bipedalism (Chalicotheriinae) and a full
quadrupedalism (Schizotheriinae), respectively (Coombs, 1983). Another example of independent con-
vergence towards a high body mass can be found in some South American native ungulates (belonging
to the non-consensual clade Meridiungulata now considered as the sister-taxon of all Perissodactyla)
(Buckley, 2015; Welker et al., 2015). Groups like Notoungulata and Litopterna include species
weighting more than a ton (Toxodon, Macrauchenia – MacFadden, 2005; Fariña, Czerwonogora & Gia-
como, 2014) (Figure 51). The inclusion of these taxa, coupled with the different approaches previously
described (inclusion of all limb segments, modular and microanatomical investigation) should enable
to highlight how the shape of the bone modifies in each group to support a high body mass and to
search for potential common variation trends despite a strong diversity of body constructions.

Articles de diffusion scientifique

Légalisation de la corne de rhinocéros, un remède pire que le mal ?
Publié le 5 novembre 2018 : https://theconversation.com/legalisation-de-la-corne-de-rhinoceros-un-
remede-pire-que-le-mal-106387

C’est une décision qui a provoqué autant d’indignation que d’incompréhension. Le 29 octobre dernier,
la Chine annonçait par voie de presse un assouplissement de sa législation 3 relative aux cornes de
rhinocéros ainsi qu’aux os de tigres.

Si le texte stipule que l’achat, la vente, l’importation ou l’exportation de « produits dérivés » du rhino-
céros et du tigre restent interdits, il signale en revanche que les cornes et ossements peuvent désor-
mais être obtenus à partir d’animaux d’élevage, à des fins de recherche médicale ou de soins, par des
hôpitaux ou soignants autorisés par le gouvernement chinois.

L’annonce, accueillie par un torrent de critiques, a notamment laissé perplexe le WWF, l’une des plus
importantes organisations mondiales de protection de l’environnement, qui s’inquiète d’une réouver-
ture 4 d’un marché pourtant jugé illégal en Chine depuis 1993.

Qu’est-il donc passé par la tête des autorités chinoises ?

Un précédent en Afrique du Sud

À y regarder de plus près, ce revirement intervient un an et demi après une décision similaire en
Afrique du Sud 5, où subsistent 70 % des presque 30 000 rhinocéros blancs (Ceratotherium simum)
encore en vie.

En avril 2017, un moratoire en vigueur dans le pays depuis 2009 prenait fin, réautorisant le commerce
de cornes en Afrique du Sud. Une décision lourdement influencée par un certain John Hume 6, riche

propriétaire terrien pouvant se targuer d’être le plus gros éleveur de rhinocéros au monde, avec 1 600
animaux.

Le calcul de Hume est simple : initialement vendus à des zoos ou des réserves, ces rhinocéros repré-
sentent désormais un moyen contrôlé de produire de la corne « d’élevage ». La corne étant composée
de kératine comme nos cheveux ou nos ongles, elle peut être prélevée sans douleur et repousse au fil
du temps. Ainsi, en décornant son cheptel régulièrement, Hume aurait accumulé près de 6 tonnes de
corne qu’il entend vendre pour inonder le marché illégal et contrecarrer le braconnage.

Mais cette décision sud-africaine ne concerne que le marché interne au pays, quasiment inexistant,
puisque l’essentiel de la corne s’échange en Asie. La récente décision chinoise semble donc répondre
à celle de l’Afrique du Sud, en vue de créer peu à peu un cadre légal mondial pour réguler le trafic de
corne de rhinocéros : il deviendrait alors possible aux producteurs sud-africains de vendre légalement
à des consommateurs asiatiques.

Un trafic global

Hasard du calendrier, à peine deux semaines avant la décision de la Chine, était diffusé en France le
documentaire Rhino dollars 7 d’Olivia Mokiejewski, montrant l’ampleur et la complexité du trafic de
corne à travers une investigation saisissante 8, remontant la plupart des maillons de la chaîne.

Car loin d’être un simple problème d’écologie et de disparition des espèces, le trafic de corne – et plus
généralement des produits issus d’animaux – représente le quatrième plus gros trafic mondial, derrière
ceux de la drogue, des armes et des êtres humains.

En Afrique du Sud, il prospère sur les ruines de l’Apartheid, les inégalités sociales que ce système a
engendrées, et sur le niveau de vie très faible d’une grande partie de la population. Un rhinocéros
abattu peut rapporter au braconnier 50 à 100 fois le salaire moyen 9 : difficile de parler d’écologie
quand la corne devient le seul moyen de faire vivre sa famille ! La situation précaire dans les pays
limitrophes, comme au Mozambique, entretient également un afflux régulier de braconniers, tout en
permettant à des parrains locaux de s’enrichir rapidement.

De l’autre côté de la planète, les consommateurs, derniers maillons de la chaîne, se rencontrent prin-
cipalement au Vietnam et en Chine.

Un rôle social de premier plan

Vu d’Occident, il est courant d’accuser la médecine traditionnelle asiatique d’employer ce prétendu
remède miracle pour tout et n’importe quoi – quand bien même aucune étude scientifique sérieuse 10
n’a jamais prouvé quelque effet que ce soit.

Si ce rôle médicinal reste important, des enquêtes sur le terrain ont également clairement montré le
rôle social 11 de la corne de rhinocéros.

Symbole de réussite, elle peut servir à sceller un gros contrat ou simplement être offerte comme
marque de respect à une personne importante, voire un officiel de l’État. Une tendance vietnamienne
se développe même depuis quelques années, consistant à offrir de la corne à un proche se sachant
condamné par un cancer : le présent indique alors que la famille a retourné ciel et terre pour offrir un
ultime cadeau d’exception.

C’est d’ailleurs probablement une rumeur autour d’un prétendu homme politique miraculeusement
guéri d’un cancer par la corne qui a fait s’envoler le trafic au cours de la dernière décennie. Alors que
les années 2000 avaient vu un net recul du braconnage et qu’on ne dénombrait que 13 rhinocéros tués
en 2007 en Afrique du Sud, le massacre a dépassé les 1 200 têtes 7 ans plus tard, soit une augmentation
de 9 300 % 12. La faute à un appel d’air créée par cette rumeur au Vietnam, amplifiée par les trafiquants
eux-mêmes, prêts à tout pour faire s’envoler les prix et la demande.

C’est dans ce contexte de tensions renouvelées qu’a germé l’idée d’un commerce régulé et organisé.
Mais est-ce réellement la bonne voie à prendre endiguer le massacre ?

Les sérieuses limites à la légalisation

Sans surprise, les principaux partisans d’une régulation de ce commerce sont les éleveurs de rhinocé-
ros eux-mêmes 13, à l’image de John Hume. Persuadés que le marché se régulera de lui-même et que
la nature ne peut être protégée que lorsqu’on lui attribue une valeur monétaire, ils attendent la mise
en place d’un commerce légal et libéral, encadré le moins possible par les États.

Mais la grande majorité des chercheurs et écologistes se penchant sur le sujet craignent, bien au con-
traire, que cette possible légalisation n’aggrave la situation sur plusieurs points.

Les enquêtes de terrain 14 montrent en effet clairement que les consommateurs sont prêts à payer le
double du prix pour de la corne « sauvage », convaincus qu’elle est plus efficace ou simplement parce

que le prestige associé est supérieur. La corne d’élevage aurait ainsi du mal à remplacer la corne bra-
connée, contrairement à ce que soutient Hume.

Pire, il est hautement probable que la légalisation permette un blanchiment massif de cornes bracon-
nées, sauf à mettre en place des filières strictes et des systèmes de contrôle efficaces et mondialement
coordonnés – systèmes qui, de l’aveu même d’un pays comme le Vietnam, paraissent utopiques à
l’heure actuelle.

Tout indique également que la légalisation pourrait créer une augmentation de la demande, non seu-
lement des consommateurs réguliers, mais également auprès d’une population moins fortunée en cas
de baisse des prix.

Enfin, l’élevage des rhinocéros pourrait rapidement tourner à l’industrialisation aux dépens du bien-
être des animaux, comme le montrent l’exemple des nombreuses fermes à tigre asiatiques 15, agissant
sous couvert de conservation de l’espèce mais où les félins sont en réalité exploités pour leurs organes
dans d’atroces conditions.

Agir sur tous les maillons de la chaîne

Dans cette situation, différentes études 16 sur la légalisation du commerce de corne tendent à montrer
qu’il pourrait s’agir là de la pire des solutions. A contrario, l’endiguement du trafic doit nécessairement
passer par les différents maillons de la chaîne, à commencer par l’amélioration de la situation sociale
dans le sud de l’Afrique, permettant de réduire le nombre de braconniers.

Des précédents existent : par une politique de conservation impliquant les habitants au plus près, le
Kenya est ainsi parvenu à faire diminuer la pression du braconnage 17 sur sa faune. Les moyens d’inves-
tigation policière, permettant d’appréhender les trafiquants locaux, doivent également être renforcés
et étendus.

À l’autre bout de la chaîne, en Asie, les campagnes de sensibilisation doivent agir tant sur le plan mé-
dicinal que social, afin de faire baisser la demande, en abandonnant l’argument écologiste qui n’a qua-
siment aucun impact sur des consommateurs se sentant non-responsables de cette situation.

Il s’agit d’un travail de fond complexe, impliquant des centaines d’acteurs différents à l’échelle mon-
diale, mais qui s’avérera certainement plus efficace qu’une légalisation aux conséquences

Qui était Elasmotherium, surnommé la « licorne de Sibérie » ?
Publié le 28 février 2019 : https://theconversation.com/qui-etait-elasmotherium-surnomme-la-licorne-

Cet article a fait l’objet d’une intervention dans l’émission de vulgarisation scientifique quotidienne «
La Tête au carré », produite par Mathieu Vidard sur France Inter (émission du 1er mars 2019 présentée
par Daniel Fievet, en compagnie d'Aline Richard, éditrice science et technologie pour The Conversation
France) : https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/la-tete-au-carre/la-tete-au-carre-01-mars-2019).

Lorsque l’on évoque la Préhistoire et ses animaux emblématiques, les premières scènes venant im-
manquablement à l’esprit sont souvent peuplées de mammouths laineux, de chevaux bondissants
comme sur les parois de la grotte de Lascaux, ou encore de bisons, d’aurochs, de lions ou d’ours des
cavernes. Pourtant, cette période ne se résume pas aux paysages de steppes glacées du Paléolithique
supérieur en Europe occidentale, et bon nombre d’autres espèces disparues, petites ou grosses, ont
de quoi étonner par leur apparence, leurs dimensions ou leur mode de vie.

Tel est le cas d’Elasmotherium 18, un genre cousin des rhinocéros actuels et laineux, appartenant
comme eux à la famille des Rhinocérotidés 19, mais bien moins connu du grand public que ses proches
parents en voie d’extinction. Pourtant, cette créature ne passait certainement pas inaperçue : avec des
mensurations estimées à 4,5 m de long et 2 m au garrot, pour une masse entre 4 et 5 tonnes, il faisait
partie intégrante de ce que les paléontologues nomment la « mégafaune du Pléistocène » 20. Plus gros
que le rhinocéros laineux, il était en outre pourvu d’un énorme dôme frontal, interprété par la plupart
des chercheurs comme le support d’une immense corne pouvant atteindre 2 m de hauteur. Ceci lui a
valu le surnom de « licorne de Sibérie » – même si ses mensurations ne lui confèrent pas vraiment
l’apparence du cheval cornu mythologique.

Une disparition plus tardive qu’on ne le pensait

De plus, Elasmotherium est un des premiers genres fossiles décrits en paléontologie, nommé dès 1808
par le naturaliste allemand Fischer 21 – avant même que ne soient scientifiquement reconnus trois des
cinq espèces de rhinocéros actuels ! Malgré la découverte de plusieurs squelettes complets, il n’est
pas un habitant de notre imaginaire collectif préhistorique (du moins occidental). Probablement parce
qu’il vivait loin : les quelques espèces connues d’Elasmotherium, comme E. sibiricum ou E. caucasicum,
ont été découvertes principalement en Asie centrale, en Russie du sud, en Ukraine, au Kazakhstan, en

Chine et en Mongolie. Et également parce que sa disparition est estimée à 200 000 ans avant le présent
: bien trop tôt pour rencontrer les hommes et femmes de Cro-Magnon européens qui auraient pu les
représenter à travers leur art pariétal ou mobilier.

Du moins cette date était-elle acceptée jusqu’à la publication d’une nouvelle étude 22 en novembre
2018 dans la revue Nature par Pavel Kosintsev et ses collaborateurs. Les chercheurs ont réétudié 25
spécimens d’Elasmotherium sibiricum présents dans plusieurs musées en Russie et au Royaume-Uni.
Ils ont notamment pu utiliser le collagène encore présent dans les os pour dater les spécimens à l’aide
de la technique dite « AMS » (pour « Accelerator Mass Spectroscopy » 23), permettant un comptage
extrêmement précis des isotopes de carbone 14 dans l’échantillon. Surprise : les âges obtenus placent
la disparition d’Elasmotherium aux alentours de 39 à 36 000 ans avant le présent.

Un bond dans le temps qui le rend désormais contemporain de la transition entre Homo neanderta-
lensis et Homo sapiens en Europe. Il pourrait même avoir survécu jusqu’aux alentours de 26 000 ans si
l’on s’en réfère à la découverte d’un crâne au Kazakhstan en 2016 24 : malheureusement, ce spécimen
ayant été découvert dans un environnement humide difficile à analyser, la datation de ce crâne reste
à nuancer, sa signature isotopique ayant pu être contaminée.

Avec cette disparition s’est éteinte une lignée pourtant vieille de plusieurs dizaines de millions d’an-
nées, prenant racine au milieu de l’Éocène : l’étude de l’équipe de Kosintsev réévalue en effet la sépa-
ration entre la sous-famille des Elasmotheriinae et celle des Rhinocerotinae (à laquelle appartiennent
les rhinocéros actuels) aux alentours de 47 millions d’années. Au cours du Tertiaire, les Elasmothères
ont ainsi eu le temps de se diversifier et de coloniser une bonne partie de la planète, comme le montre
notamment l’étude menée sur ce groupe par Pierre-Olivier Antoine en 2002 25. Les petites formes telles
que Bugtirhinus, atteignant un mètre au garrot, vont progressivement donner naissance à une dizaine
d’espèces différentes tout au long du Miocène, lesquelles furent découvertes en Asie centrale mais
également en Afrique ou en Europe, comme Hispanotherium, mis au jour en Espagne et en France.

Tout au long de l’évolution de cette lignée se développe également un caractère unique chez les rhi-
nocéros : la présence de dents à croissance continue (dite « hypsodontes » 26), poussant durant toute
la vie de l’animal et s’usant au fur et à mesure, à l’image des incisives de rongeurs. Ce trait confère aux
molaires d’Elasmotherium, chez qui cette hypsodontie est maximale, un aspect unique composé de

lames d’émail caractéristiques, ce qui donnera d’ailleurs son nom scientifique à l’animal – du grec «
elasmos » (lame) et « therion » (bête).

Refroidissement du climat

Cette caractéristique particulière a d’ailleurs peut-être causé sa perte. En effet, cette hypsodontie est
considérée comme une spécialisation à la consommation de graminées très abrasifs, associée à l’in-
gestion involontaire des poussières et grains de sable près du sol : Elasmotherium passait ainsi une
grande partie de son temps à brouter dans les steppes et prairies d’Asie centrale, et ses dents pous-
saient en permanence pour compenser une usure rapide et prononcée. Kosintsev et ses collaborateurs
relient donc sa disparition à un changement climatique concomitant : un refroidissement généralisé
du climat – qui mènera quelques milliers d’années plus tard au dernier maximum glaciaire 27 – aurait
provoqué une fragmentation des prairies et un développement d’un environnement de toundra sèche,
bien moins favorable à ce rhinocéros géant. Conjointement avec d’autres espèces, il n’aurait ainsi pas
pu s’adapter à la raréfaction de sa nourriture et aurait fini par disparaître, là où ses cousins les rhino-
céros laineux purent proliférer.

Une licorne… sans corne ?

Cette nouvelle date de disparation supposée rouvre le vieux débat de la rencontre potentielle entre
nos ancêtres et cet animal. Si aucun reste osseux n’a jamais livré de traces irréfutables de chasse ou
de prédation directe ou indirecte, un dessin énigmatique dans la grotte de Rouffignac 28 en Dordogne
pose question. Sur les parois couvertes de représentations de mammouths et rhinocéros laineux figure
également une étrange silhouette, comme une sorte de rhinocéros à la corne démesurée et au garrot
gigantesque.

Interprété dès 1964 comme une potentielle représentation d’Elasmotherium, le dessin conserve pour-
tant ses mystères. S’il est vrai que la silhouette tranche avec la plupart des rhinocéros de l’art pariétal
européen, lesquelles possèdent quasi-systématiquement leurs deux cornes emblématiques, les
œuvres de Rouffignac datent néanmoins de « seulement » 13 000 ans, soit bien après la disparition
supposée de l’espèce. De plus, à part la découverte au XIXe siècle d’une dent potentielle d’Elasmothe-
rium dans la Somme (malheureusement perdue depuis), jamais aucun reste de l’animal n’a été identi-
fié si loin à l’ouest de l’Europe. D’autres figurations dans la grotte de Kapova en Russie 29 ont parfois
été interprétées comme des représentations d’Elasmotherium, là encore sans aucune certitude.

Ces interprétations s’appuient en outre sur la présence supposée d’une corne gigantesque. Or, rien ne
l’indique avec certitude, car aucune corne d’Elasmotherium n’a jamais été retrouvée à l’état fossile !
La présence d’une corne démesurée a été supposée dès la découverte des premiers crânes, par ana-
logie avec les rhinocéros actuels et par observation du dôme frontal proéminent. Mais l’observation
des rugosités osseuses à la base des cornes sur les rhinocéros actuels ne permettent que difficilement
de présager de la longueur de celle-ci. Certains auteurs russes ont ainsi proposé au milieu du XXe siècle
des reconstitutions avec des cornes de taille et forme variables, parfois limitées à une simple excrois-
sance tournée vers l’arrière, voire pas de corne du tout ! Et même s’il est difficile d’imaginer cela, tant
la représentation de cet animal semble aller d’elle-même, seule la découverte d’une corne fossilisée
permettrait de préciser réellement la taille et la forme de l’appendice emblématique d’Elasmotherium.
Nous saurions alors enfin si la « licorne de Sibérie » mérite bel et bien son nom mythologique.

Travaux annexes
Lors de ces trois années de thèse, j’ai été amené à participer au travail de plusieurs étudiants de Master
sur des os de rhinocéros. J’ai co-encadré les travaux de Lou Moizo (M1) concernant la variation de la
forme de la patella au sein des Perissodactyla actuels et fossiles, ainsi que les travaux de Kévin Gayod
(M1) portant sur la comparaison critique des différentes méthodes d’estimation de masse corporelle
au sein des mammifères. Ces deux études feront l’objet de publications prochainement.

J’ai également participé au travail de Cyril Etienne (M2) concernant la variation de forme de l’astragale
et du calcanéum en fonction de la masse corporelle chez les Perissodactyla actuels et fossiles. Mon
implication concernait essentiellement l’échantillonnage via la numérisation d’ossements, mais j’ai
également été impliqué sur la réflexion globale de l’étude et de ses résultats. Ce travail a fait l’objet
d’une publication en 2020 dans Biological Journal of the Linnean Society dont je reproduis une version
dans les pages suivantes.

Many tetrapod lineages show extreme increases in body mass in their evolutionary history, associated with important
osteological changes. The ankle joint, essential for foot movement, is assumed to be particularly affected in this regard.
We investigated the morphological adaptations of the astragalus and the calcaneus in Rhinocerotidae, and analysed
them in light of a comparative analysis with other Perissodactyla. We performed 3D geometric morphometrics and
correlated shape with centroid size of the bone and body mass of the species. Our results show that mass has an
influence on bone shape in Rhinocerotidae and in Perissodactyla, but this is not as strong as expected. In heavy
animals the astragalus has a flatter trochlea, orientated more proximally, associated with a more upright posture
of the limb. The calcaneus is more robust, possibly to sustain the greater tension force exerted by the muscles
during plantarflexion. Both bones show wider articular facets, providing greater cohesion and better dissipation
of the loading forces. The body plan of the animals also has an influence. Short-legged Teleoceratina have a flatter
astragalus than the other rhinocerotids. Paraceratherium has a thinner calcaneus than expected. This study clarifies
adaptations to high body weight among Rhinocerotidae and calls for similar investigations in other groups with
massive forms.

Abstract

In terrestrial vertebrates, the shape of the limb bones is influenced, among other factors, by functional constraints, notably the need to resist loading
stresses due to gravity. This led, in quadrupeds weighting hundreds of kilograms, to morphological modifications of the limb bones to avoid crushing.
Such architectural modifications related to a heavy weight have been historically qualified as “graviportal”. Rhinocerotoidea are of particular interest
to study the morphological changes of the limb bones related to body mass, as they are represented by five extant species and dozens of fossil genera,
some being among the heaviest land mammals that ever existed. Several independent occurrences of an increase of body mass are observed in this
superfamily, making it relevant to study the variation of shape in relation to weight. This work explores the shape variation of the limb long bones
relatively to body mass and body proportions among Rhinocerotoidea along their evolutionary history, in order to better understand how the skeleton
modifies to meet the functional requirements of a coordinated locomotion and the support of a heavy weight. To do so, I used a 3D geometric
morphometrics approach to qualify and quantify the shape of the six bones composing the stylopodium and zeugopodium of a sample of modern and
fossil specimens. The exploration of the long bone shape variation and covariation in relation to body mass and to the evolutionary legacy in modern
rhinos has been completed by the study of numerous fossil representatives to cover a large range of weight and body proportions, taking into account
the evolutionary history of the group. My work highlights an increase of bone robustness common to all heavy rhinos. The development of the
insertions for powerful extensor muscles and the likely presence of passive-stay apparatuses at shoulder and knee joints in heavy rhino taxa allow to
better resist flexion caused by loading forces. My results show that forelimb bones are more influenced by body mass variation than hind limb ones
in Rhinocerotoidea, likely due to the different proportion of body mass that they support and to their distinct respective roles of brake and propulsion.
The shape of the stylopodium bones is simultaneously related to evolutionary legacy and body mass, while that of the zeugopodium is mostly associ-
ated with the degree of brachypody (i.e. relative limb length). The fibula is the only bone showing puzzling patterns of shape variation dominated by
intraspecific variations, which questions its functional role in weight bearing. The shape variation in Rhinocerotoidea carries a dual signal with uniform
aspects shared by all heavy species coupled with specific features in the different taxa, corresponding to the multiplicity of limb constructions ob-
served in the superfamily. In addition to modifications related to heavy weight, most Rhinocerotoidea retain features of running quadrupeds while
displaying different ways to sustain a high mass, questioning the classical definition of graviportality mainly based on elephants. This highlights the
necessity to redefine graviportality by highlighting what are the repeated features potentially linked to it in each group with independent occurrences
of heavy weight.

Résumé

Chez les vertébrés terrestres, la forme des os des membres est influencée notamment par des contraintes fonctionnelles, comme la nécessité de
résister aux contraintes de charge dues à la gravité. Ceci conduit, chez des quadrupèdes pesant plusieurs centaines de kilos, à des modifications
morphologiques des os des membres pour éviter l'écrasement. De telles modifications architecturales liées à un poids élevé ont été qualifiées de
"graviporteuses". Les Rhinocerotoidea présentent un intérêt particulier pour l'étude des modifications morphologiques des os des membres liées à
la masse corporelle, car ils sont représentés par cinq espèces actuelles et des dizaines de genres fossiles, certains faisant partie des mammifères
terrestres les plus lourds qui aient jamais existé. Plusieurs occurrences indépendantes d'augmentation de la masse corporelle sont observées dans
cette superfamille, ce qui rend pertinente l'étude de la variation de la forme en fonction du poids au sein de ce groupe. Ce travail explore la variation
de la forme des os longs des membres en relation avec la masse et les proportions du corps chez les Rhinocerotoidea au cours de leur histoire
évolutive, afin de mieux comprendre comment le squelette se modifie pour répondre aux exigences fonctionnelles d'une locomotion coordonnée et
au support d'un poids élevé. Pour ce faire, j'ai utilisé une approche de morphométrie géométrique 3D pour qualifier et quantifier la forme des six os
composant le stylopode et le zeugopode. L'exploration de la variation et de la covariation de la forme des os longs par rapport à la masse corporelle
et à l'héritage évolutif chez les rhinocéros modernes a été complétée par l'étude de nombreux représentants fossiles couvrant une large gamme de
poids et de proportions corporelles en tenant compte de l'histoire évolutive du groupe. Mes travaux mettent en évidence une augmentation de la
robustesse des os commune à tous les rhinocéros lourds. Le développement des insertions des muscles extenseurs et la présence probable de sys-
tèmes de blocage passif des articulations des épaules et des genoux chez les taxons lourds permettent de mieux résister à la flexion causée par le
poids du corps. Mes résultats montrent que les os des membres antérieurs sont plus influencés par la variation de la masse corporelle que ceux des
membres postérieurs, probablement en raison de la proportion différente de la masse corporelle qu'ils supportent et de leurs rôles respectifs de
freinage et de propulsion. La forme des os du stylopode est liée à la fois à l'héritage évolutif et à la masse corporelle, tandis que celle du zeugopode
est surtout associée au degré de brachypodie (c'est-à-dire à la longueur relative des membres). La fibula présente des patrons de variation de forme
très particuliers, dominés par les variations intraspécifiques, ce qui pose la question de son rôle fonctionnel dans le support du poids. La variation de
forme chez les Rhinocerotoidea est porteuse d'un double signal, avec des aspects uniformes partagés par toutes les espèces lourdes couplés à des
spécificités dans les différents taxons, correspondant à la multiplicité de construction des membres observée dans la superfamille. En plus des modi-
fications liées à une forte masse, la plupart des Rhinocerotoidea conservent des caractéristiques de quadrupède coureur tout en présentant diffé-
rentes façons de soutenir une masse élevée, remettant en question la définition classique de la graviportalité principalement basée sur les éléphants.
Cela souligne la nécessité de redéfinir la graviportalité en mettant en évidence les caractéristiques répétées potentiellement liées à ce phénomène
dans chaque groupe présentant des occurrences indépendantes de masse élevée.
