Acknowledgements

First of all, I would like to express a special thanks to my thesis director Bruno Espagnon. I highly value the discus-

sions we had on physics and your willingness to answer any questions I asked. For the day-to-day supervision, I

would like to express a special thanks to my supervisor Zaida. Your exemplify for me a keen mind and attention to

detail. And there is of course your golden rule that I mostly adhered to: never ask more than 1 question in an email,

if you want to have them answered! Another person to whom I feel deep gratitude is Christophe, who was partic-

ularly present during the second half of my thesis. I enjoyed working under your supervision on the DualSampa’s.

Moreover, I obtained some silent insights from watching you lead the team, that might come in handy one day.

   I cannot forget of course the other members of the team at Orsay. Special thanks is given first and foremost to

Cynthia and Chun-Lu for being one of my valued cookie testers (together with Ho-San Ko and Mylène). Chun-Lu, we

spent a lot of time together discovering Paris and trying to understand the french way of thinking. Laure, you were

always willing to answer any technical questions I had, for which I’m grateful. Jana, whom I only got to know for a

brief period, but you were able to impart some wisdom into me regardless. Your books about dealing with the french

were very much appreciated! Thera, Afnan and Charlotte, we spent limited time together due to circumstances

beyond our control but I have good memories of our interactions.

   Furthermore, I would like to take a moment to thank Ingo Schienbein, Marie Hélène-Schune, Diego Stocco and

Bruno Espagnon for agreeing to be in the Jury and Marco van Leeuwen and Philippe Rosnet for accepting the role

of rapporteur on top of that.

   Going back in time a bit, I would also like to thank the team at the University of Utrecht and Nikhef, where I did

my master thesis with the ALICE group. It was here that I got my first real taste of the life of a scientist, and through

my development here I was able to continue on with the team in Orsay. So I would like to express a warm thanks to

Panos and Rihan for their supervision, and Davide for helping me apply for the PhD position that I ended up filling.

   Physics aside, a PhD is also a great time to make new friends with other students. Melih, I enjoyed the regular

visits to musea and restaurants together with Chun-Lu. Then there are the students from across the hallway: Pierre,

Sheng-Ying, Ho-San Ko and Mylène. We always had a great time, whether visiting bars or the mountains in Lyon.

A special mention goes out to Guillaume, Nicolò and Ophélie, who were my partners in crime for the paper writing

process. I’m happy we were able to share the occasional late-night stress together.

   Lastly but certainly not leastly, I would like to appreciate my family and friends back home. In particular, my

parents, my brothers, and my aunt and uncle. On top of that, my friends who found the time to visit Paris, spending

some days together always felt like mini vacations.

Synthèse en français

   Chapitre 1: Introduction

Le modèle standard (SM) classifie toutes les particules et leurs interactions. Dans le SM, la chromodynamique

quantique (QCD) décrit l’interaction forte et possède deux propriétés importantes. La première est celle de confine-

ment, qui impose que les charges de couleur ne peuvent pas être observés isolées. Il est seulement possible de

mesurer des particules composites, qui sont incolores. La deuxième propriété de QCD est la liberté asymptotique,

qui impose qu’à courtes distances (ou à hautes énergies), l’interaction forte s’affaiblit. Dans des conditions extrêmes

de très haute densité de particules et/ou de très haute température, la liberté asymptotique amène à un nouvel état

de la matière, appelé le Plasma de Quarks et Gluons (QGP). En réalisant des collisions d’ions lourds, il est possible

d’atteindre ces conditions extrêmes, et d’étudier le QGP. Cela est important afin de comprendre l’univers quelques

microsecondes après le Big Bang, qui était supposément composé d’un QGP.

   La QCD permet de calculer des sections efficaces des processus partoniques. Par contre, à cause du confine-

ment, les partons libres n’existent pas dans la nature. Des modèles ont été conçus afin de décrire la production

des particules dans des collisions proton-proton. L’un de ces modèles est la factorisation colinéaire inclusive. En

convoluant les sections efficaces partoniques avec les probabilités de trouver des partons, des sections efficaces

hadroniques peuvent être calculées. Cela est fait en particulier pour les particules lourdes ou très énergétiques

(appelées les sondes dures) pour lesquelles il est possible de calculer les sections efficaces partoniques avec la

QCD perturbative. La probabilité de trouver un parton donné est encodé dans les fonctions de distributions des

partons (PDFs). Ce sont des objets non-perturbatifs, ce qui veut dire qu’ils ne peuvent pas être dérivés de QCD.

Ils sont obtenus par des ajustements basés sur des mesures expérimentales. Des mesures ont montré que ces

distributions de partons sont différentes entre les protons et les ions lourds. Les distributions des partons dans les

ions lourds ne sont pas de simples superpositions de celles des protons et des neutrons. En conséquent, pour

comprendre la production des particules lourdes dans des collisions d’ions lourds, il est très important de connaître

les distributions de partons nucléaires (nPDFs). Il est en effet crucial de bien séparer ces effets, venant de la

matière froide, de ceux de la matière chaude (c’est à dire le QGP). Comme les PDFs, les nPDFs sont obtenus par

des ajustements basés sur des mesures expérimentales. Les bosons électrofaibles sont des outils particulièrement

utiles pour étudier et contraindre les nPDFs. Ne possédant pas de charge de couleur, ils n’interagissent pas avec


                                                          v


le QGP qui se forme dans les collisions d’ions lourds.

   Récemment, des corrélations angulaires et des augmentations du taux de production d’étrangeté ont été ob-

servées dans des collisions pp et p–A à haute multiplicité. Les observations étaient surprenantes car ces phénomènes

sont typiquement associés au QGP. Beaucoup d’efforts théoriques prennent place pour mieux comprendre ce com-

portement. Une origine suggérée est celle des interaction multiples de partons (MPI). Cette modélisation est basée

sur le fait qu’à hautes énergies, les densités de parton s’accroissent fortement. Cela augmente la probabilité que

plusieurs partons se heurtent pendant une seule collision pp (ou p–A). Ces MPI peuvent, entre outre, se manifester

dans la production de plusieurs particules lourdes comme le J/ψ. La production des paires de J/ψ est sensible aux

contributions d’un seule diffusion (SPS) ou de double diffusion (DPS) de partons.

   Chapitre 2: Le détecteur ALICE

ALICE est un détecteur dédié aux ions lourds. Il a pour dimensions 16 × 16 × 16 m3 et pèse 10000 tonnes. Le

détecteur est capable de mesurer une grande variété de particules, comme les hadrons, les électrons, les muons

et les photons. Le système de déclenchement d’acquisition des événements utilise principalement le détecteur V0.

Le V0 se compose d’une paire de détecteurs de scintillement qui sont placés de chaque côté du point d’interaction

(IP). Le Silicon Pixel Detector, qui entoure l’IP, est utilisé pour obtenir le vertex primaire d’une collision. Les analyses

décrites dans cette thèse utilisent des données récoltées par le spectromètre à muons d’ALICE.

   Le spectromètre à muons couvre la pseudo-rapidité 2.5 < |η| < 4 et consiste en

   • 5 stations de trajectographie, chacune équipée de deux chambres de trajectographie

   • des absorbeurs qui réduisent le bruit de fond venant des décroissances des pions et kaons

   • un aimant dipolaire pour courber les trajectoires des muons afin de permettre la mesure de leur impulsion

   • 2 stations de déclenchement, chacune équipée de deux chambres de déclenchement. Cela permet de sélec-

      tionner des événements qui contiennent une paire de muons de charges opposées

   Chapitre 3: Boson Z: méthode d’analyse

Les objectifs de l’analyse de la production du boson Z sont de quantifier la production invariante dans des collisions

Pb–Pb et de la comparer avec la production dans des collisions pp. La production invariante en collisions Pb–Pb

sera normalisée par la fonction de recouvrement nucléaire afin de la réduire à l’équivalent d’une collision nucléon-

nucléon.

   L’analyse est conduite sur les données de collisions Pb–Pb à une énergie dans le centre de masse par paire de
             √
nucléons de sNN = 5.02 TeV. Les données ont été récoltées par le spectromètre à muons en 2015 et 2018. Le

déclenchement des événements est appelé CMUL7. Les événements CMUL7 sont définis par le déclenchement

de bias minimum, définie par la coïncidence d’un signal dans les détecteurs V0A et V0C, auquel se rajoute le

déclenchement lié au signal d’une paire de muons de charges opposées. Certains critères sont requis pour les


                                                             vi


traces de muons analysées. Parmi d’autres, la pseudo-rapidité des traces doit satisfaire la condition −4 < ηµ < −2.5

et l’impulsion transverse doit être suffisamment grande, pT µ > 20 GeV/c.

   Pour extraire le signal des bosons Z, toutes les paires possibles de muons (dimuons) de charges opposées sont

associées événement par événement pour construire le spectre de masse invariante. Une sélection sur la rapidité

des dimuons est faite (2.5 < yµµ < 4.0). Le nombre de bosons Z est déterminé avec le spectre de masse invariante

en comptant le nombre de dimuons qui ont une masse 60 < mµµ < 120 GeV/c2 . Dans l’ensemble des données,

208 candidats bosons Z ont été trouvés. Le nombre de candidats Z produits est ensuite corrigé par l’acceptance

cinématique et l’efficacité du détecteur. Le facteur de correction acceptance×efficacité est déterminé avec des

simulations PYTHIA 6 et POWHEG. Finalement, le taux de production est normalisé par le nombre équivalent

d’événements de biais minimum utilisé dans l’analyses afin d’obtenir la production invariante. Le calcul du nombre

d’événements de biais minimum passe par le calcul d’un facteur reliant ces derniers au CMUL7, plus sélectif, défini

précédemment.

   Chapitre 4: Boson Z: résultats

Dans cette section, la production invariante du boson Z est détaillée. Elle est présentée en fonction de la centralité

et de la rapidité et intégrée sur ces variables. Les résultats sont comparés à plusieurs prédictions théoriques.

Certains modèles théoriques comprennent des modifications nucléaires aux distributions de partons, c’est-à-dire

des nPDFs. Ces modèles s’appellent EPS09s, EPPS16, et NCTEQ. Un seul modèle, CT14NLO, ne comprend pas

de telles modifications et considère les noyaux comme des superpositions simples des protons et neutrons.

   La production invariante dans la classe de centralité de 0-90% et dans l’intervalle de rapidité 2.5 < yµµ < 4.0 est

en accord avec les trois modèles de nPDF. Par contre, une différence de 3.4 σ est trouvée entre la valeur mesurée

et celle prédite par CT14NLO. Cette différence est plus grande que la différence de 2.3 σ obtenue dans une mesure

précédente d’ALICE (qui utilisait une statistique moindre, i.e. un sous-ensemble des données utilisées dans cette

thèse). Les trois modèles de nPDF prédisent une valeur plus basse que celle du CT14NLO. Cette diminution est

attribuée à deux effets nucléaires: l’ombrage, ou shadowing, à bas Bjorken-x (fraction d’impulsion emportée par un

parton) et l’effet EMC à Bjorken-x intermédiaire, qui tous deux causent une déplétion des fonctions de distribution

des partons nucléaires comparées à celles de protons et de neutrons. Dans un schéma de production de type

2 → 1, un Z produit dans l’acceptance du spectromètre à muons provient principalement de partons possédant des

Bjorken-x dans les régions du shadowing et de l’EMC.

   En fonction de la rapidité, la production invariante de Z est en accord avec EPPS16, mais en désaccord avec

CT14NLO. Le désaccord avec CT14NLO augmente pour les plus grandes valeurs de rapidité. Cela s’explique par

le fait qu’à grande rapidité les valeurs de Bjorken-x sondées diminuent et l’effet d’ombrage est donc plus prononcé.

   La production invariante de Z en fonction de la centralité est compatible avec une valeur constante. Cela est

attendu pour les sondes dures incolores insensible aux effets de QGP. C’est un test important pour le modèle

de Glauber à partir duquel de nombreuses quantités géométriques utilisées dans les collisions d’ions lourds sont


                                                         vii


calculées.

   Chapitre 5: Boson Z: projections pour LHC Run 3

Les nPDFs sont obtenues par des ajustements basés sur des mesures expérimentales. La plupart des données à

hautes énergies proviennent du LHC et concernent donc des ions de plomb. Par conséquent, la dépendance en

masse atomique A n’est pas bien connue. Des mesures faites sur des collisions d’ions plus légers seront utiles pour

contraindre cette dépendance. Dans le LHC Run 3, des collisions d’oxygène sont prévues. Plus spécifiquement, ce
                                                                                        √
sont des collisions p–O à une énergie dans le centre de masse par paire de nucléons de sNN = 9 TeV et O–O à
√
  sNN = 6.37 TeV. Les luminosités intégrées attendues dans les deux systèmes de collisions sont 5 nb−1 et 1 nb−1 ,

respectivement. Dans cette thèse, des projections de la production du boson Z ont été faites pour déterminer si une

mesure serait faisable.

   Les projections sont obtenues par extrapolation des mesures actuelles de la section efficace du boson Z publiées

par les collaborations ALICE et LHCb. Cependant, les mesures de section efficace existantes sont faites à une

énergie différente de celles des collisions oxygène. De plus, la distributions en rapidité des bosons Z produits

change aussi en fonction de l’énergie et du système de collision. Par conséquent, des corrections ont dû être

appliquées sur les mesures actuelles. Ces corrections sont obtenues par des simulations PYTHIA 6. Pour valider

la stratégie, des sections efficaces déjà mesurées ont été recalculées et un bon accord a été trouvé entre les deux

valeurs.

    Finalement, il apparaît qu’avec les luminosités prévues, la production de Z dans le spectromètre à muons
                                                          √
d’ALICE serait de 3 bosons Z dans les collisions p–O à sNN = 9 TeV et elle serait de 4 bosons Z dans les
                  √
collisions O–O à sNN = 6.37 TeV. La mesure n’est donc possible dans aucun des systèmes de collision. Si le

temps de prise des données alloué était augmenté, des mesures pourraient être possible.

   Chapitre 6: Production de paires de J/ψ: méthode d’analyse et résultats

Ce chapitre présente la mesure de la section efficace des paires de J/ψ. Les J/ψ sont mesurés via leur décroissance

en une paire de muons de charge opposée et dans l’intervalle de rapidité 2.5 < yµµ < 4. L’analyse a été faite sur

l’ensemble des données du Run 2, qui comprend des collisions de protons à une énergie dans le centre de masse
    √
de s = 13 TeV, récoltées par le spectromètre à muons entre 2016 et 2018.

   En combinant toutes les paires possibles de double dimuons ou di-dimuons par événement, un spectre de masse

invariante à deux dimensions de masse a été construit. Le nombre de paires de J/ψ est extrait de ce spectre par un

ajustement à deux dimensions. Pour ce faire, les paramètres des fonctions ont préalablement été déterminés par

des ajustements aux distributions de masse invariante à une dimension. Un total de 12 configurations différentes

a été utilisé en prenant différentes combinaisons des fonctions d’ajustement pour le signal, le bruit de fond et

l’intervalle d’ajustement. Sur la base des résultats des ajustements 1-D, les paramètres de la fonction du signal

ont été fixés, et une nouvelle fonction en 2D a été construite. Cette dernière étape consiste à prendre le carré des

fonctions en 1D, en introduisant une nouvelle variable de masse. L’acceptance et l’efficacité du détecteur pour les

paires de J/ψ est factorisée comme le produit de l’acceptance et de l’efficacité déterminée pour un J/ψ en faisant

donc l’hypothèse que la paire est non-corrélée. La luminosité est calculée à partir d’un nombre d’événements

analysés de type CMUL7 renormalisé au nombre d’événements de biais minimum. Pour l’ensemble des données

analysées, une valeur de L = 24.38 ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.87 (syst)pb−1 a été trouvée pour la luminosité intégrée.

   La mesure concerne les paires de J/ψ inclusive. Cela veut dire qu’aucune distinction n’a été faite entre les con-

tributions promptes et non-promptes. La contribution non-prompte a pour origine des paires de bb̄ qui s’hadronisent

en deux hadrons beaux, qui ensuite décroissent chacun en un J/ψ. Des simulations avec PYTHIA 6 ont permis

d’estimer cette contribution.

   La section efficace inclusive des paires de J/ψ a été évaluée à 10.2 ± 2.3 (stat) ± 1.1 (syst) nb. Après soustrac-
                                                                              dσ
tion des contributions non-promptes, la section efficace différentielle est   dy   = 5.5 ± 1.5 (stat) ± 0.8 (syst) nb. Cela
                                   dσ
est en bon accord avec la valeur   dy   = 6.1 ± 0.4 (stat) ± 0.4 (syst) publiée par LHCb. Lors des prochaines prises

de données du LHC (runs 3 et 4), la luminosité intégrée devrait augmenter d’un facteur 8. Grâce à cette statistique

plus importante, la précision expérimentale s’améliorera fortement. De plus, l’installation du nouveau détecteur à

l’avant, Muon Forward Tracker, nous donnera la capacité de déterminer très précisément les vertex primaires et sec-

ondaires dans les collisions. Cela permettra de rejeter les contributions non-promptes directement en sélectionnant

les vertex déplacés.

   Chapitre 7: Conclusions

La physique de QGP est un domaine propice pour étudier la QCD sous des conditions extrêmes. Pour comprendre

le QGP, il est très important de pouvoir séparer des effets de matière chaude (le QGP) de ceux induits par la

matière nucléaire froide. En particulier, les distributions de partons dans les noyaux sont différentes de celles des

protons et neutrons. Les distributions de partons nucléaires forment la base des calculs des sections efficaces des

particules lourdes et/ou très énergétiques. Ce sont des objets non-perturbatifs, et ils sont obtenus par ajustements

basés sur des mesures expérimentales. Les données utilisées dans ces ajustements proviennent d’une multitude

de sources. Parmi ces sources, nous trouvons les mesures des bosons électrofaibles. Comme ils n’ont pas de

charge de couleur, ils n’interagissent pas avec la matière chaude et dense formée dans des collisions d’ions lourds.

En conséquent, la production des bosons électrofaibles peut être utilisée pour contraindre les nPDFs. Dans cette
                                                            √
thèse, la production du boson Z dans des collisions Pb–Pb à sNN = 5.02 TeV est rapportée. Les bosons Z sont

reconstruits via leur décroissance en une paire de muons de charges opposées, avec une impulsion transverse des

muons de pT µ > 20 GeV/c, une pseudo-rapidité des muons de −4 < ηµ < −2.5, une masse invariante des dimuons

de 60 < mµµ < 120 GeV/c2 et une rapidité des dimuons de 2.5 < yµµ < 4.0. La production a été mesurée en

fonction de la centralité et de la rapidité. Les résultats ont été comparés à des modèles théoriques incluant ou pas

les nPDFs. Les résultats montrent une forte préférence pour les modèles qui incluent des nPDFs. Une déviation

de 3.4 σ est observée entre nos résultats et les prédictions du modèle qui ne tient pas compte pas des effets

nucléaires dans les distributions de partons. En fonction de la rapidité, la préférence pour les modèles nucléaires

augmente pour les grandes valeurs de rapidité. Cela est attribué à l’effet d’ombrage qui est principalement sondé

à bas Bjorken-x, correspondant à des grandes valeurs de rapidité. Dans les runs 3 et 4 du LHC, les prises de

données en collisions Pb–Pb continueront avec un taux d’acquisition considérablement plus grand dans ALICE. La

luminosité intégrée devrait croître d’un facteur 10. Cette meilleure statistique permettra d’améliorer la précision de

nos mesures expérimentales, ce qui fournira des contraintes plus fortes dans les ajustements des nPDFs.

   En plus de la prise de données de Pb–Pb, de collisions avec des noyaux d’oxygène sont aussi prévues au LHC.

Dans cette thèse, des projections ont été faites pour la faisabilité des mesures de boson Z dans des collisions p–O
 √                        √
à sNN = 9 TeV et O–O à sNN = 6.37 TeV. Les projections ont été obtenues par des extrapolations des mesures

existantes des collaborations ALICE et LHCb. Avec les luminosités intégrées prévues les mesures ne seront pas

possibles.

   Des phénomènes typiquement associés au QGP ont récemment été observés dans des collisions pp et p–A à

haute multiplicité. Jusqu’à présent, l’origine de ces phénomènes n’est pas bien comprise. Certaines théories sug-

gèrent que des gouttelettes de QGP pourraient se former. Une autre explication est celle des interactions multiples

de partons (MPI). Le cadre des MPI est basé sur le fait qu’à haute énergie, les densités des partons augmentent

rapidement. Avec les hautes densités, il devient possible que plusieurs interactions de partons se produisent pen-

dant une seule collision pp (ou p–A). Les MPI peuvent être indirectement observées dans la production de paires

de J/ψ, qui reçoit des contributions des interactions simples (SPS) ainsi que des interactions doubles (DPS), cas le

plus simple des MPI.
                                                                                                      √
   Dans cette thèse, la production inclusive des paires de J/ψ dans des collisions proton-proton à        s = 13 TeV a été

déterminée. Les J/ψ ont été mesurés via leur décroissance en paire de muons de charges opposées dans l’intervalle

en rapidité 2.5 < yµµ < 4.0. L’analyse porte sur une luminosité intégrée de L = 24.38 ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.87 (syst)pb−1 .

La contribution des décroissances des hadrons B, autrement dit les contributions non-promptes, a été estimée.
                                                                                              dσ
Après la soustraction de ces contributions non-promptes, la section efficace différentielle   dy   vaut 5.5 ± 1.5 (stat) ±
                                                       dσ
0.8 (syst) nb. Cela est en accord avec la valeur de    dy   = 6.1 ± 0.4 (stat) ± 0.4 (syst) publiée par la collaboration

LHCb. Il faudra attendre les prochains runs du LHC et l’augmentation luminosité intégrée pour affiner nos résultats.

D’une part, nous pourrons réduire les incertitudes et exclure directement la composantes non-prompte. D’autre

part, nous voudrions mesurer la section efficace en fonction de la différence en rapidité des deux J/ψ ∆y. Cette

mesure permet notamment de séparer les contributions SPS et DPS, cette dernière étant supposée dominer la

section efficace à grand ∆y.

1.1.1    The Standard Model and Quantum Chromodynamics

The main goal of modern particle physics is to classify all elementary particles and to describe the interactions be-

tween them. This information is encapsulated in the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, which was developed

in the latter half of the 20th century. The Standard Model classifies two kinds of elementary particles: fermions

with half-integer spin, and bosons with integer spin. Fermions are considered the building blocks of all matter, while

interactions between them are mediated by the elementary bosons. The fermions can be subdivided into quarks

that participate in strong interactions and leptons that only participate in electroweak interactions. Both quarks and

leptons can be arranged into a family structure, where each subsequent generation has the same quantum num-

bers as the previous, with the exception of mass. Lastly, for each particle, there is a corresponding antiparticle, with

opposite charge and magnetic moment. An overview of the SM is shown in Fig. 1.1. With the discovery of the Higgs

boson in 2012, all particles of the Standard Model have been experimentally observed.

   The SM not only classifies which particles exist, but also how the various particles can interact with each other.

Three of the four fundamental forces are described within the Standard Model: the strong force, the electromagnetic

force and the weak force. They are mediated by respectively gluons, photons, and the W and Z bosons. It has been

shown that the electromagnetic force and weak force can be unified into a single electroweak (EW) theory. This

insight has led to the question of whether the EW force and strong force can also be unified into a singular force,

in a Grand Unified Theory. Another open question of the Standard Model is how the last fundamental force, gravity,

can be included.

   The strong force is described by a part of the SM called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In QCD, interactions

occur through exchanges of color charge, mediated by gluons. A unique feature of QCD is that gluons themselves

fermions) is shown, as well as the fundamental bosons that describe their interactions. Figure taken from [1].


carry color charge. In contrast, in electromagnetic interactions described by Quantum Electrodynamics (QED),

photons are the mediators of interactions while they themselves carry no electric charge. Highly non-trivial dynamics

arise from the fact that gluons carry color charge, and can therefore interact with other gluons. When gauge theories

such as QCD are renormalized (a procedure necessary to obtain meaningful results at higher orders in perturbation

theory), the coupling constant is no longer constant. Instead, it is said to run, and becomes dependent on the energy

scale of interactions. The presence of the aforementioned self-interactions drastically influences the behavior of the

running of the coupling αs , shown in Figure 1.2.

Figure 1.2: Running of the coupling αs as a function of the energy scale Q. At large Q, the coupling becomes weak.
Oppositely, at low Q, αs becomes so large that perturbative QCD is no longer applicable. Figure taken from [2].


   The running of the QCD coupling has two main features. First, as the energy scale Q grows (or equivalently


                                                                     6


at smaller distances), αs becomes weaker. This feature of QCD is called asymptotic freedom. For energy scales

0.1 − 1 TeV, αs ∼ 0.1, which means that perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to compute physical quantities

such as production cross sections. On the other hand, at low energy scale (equivalently, at large distances), the

coupling diverges. Lattice QCD calculations show that due to the large value of αs at large distances, the potential

energy between two color charges increases linearly. When separating two color charges (i.e. quarks or gluons),

it becomes energetically more favorable at some point to create a new quark-antiquark pair, so that in the end free

color charges are never observed in Nature. Instead, only colorless bound states consisting of two or more quarks

have been observed. This phenomenon is called (color) confinement. Confinement is related to the divergence

of αs at low energy scales, but because confinement is a non-perturbative process, no proof from first principles

exists1 . The composite particles that can be observed are called hadrons. A subdivision is made between bound

states of even numbers of quarks called mesons and of odd numbers of quarks called baryons.



1.1.2       The Quark-Gluon Plasma and heavy-ion collisions

Shortly after the introduction of asymptotic freedom in QCD, two separate groups realised its consequences. Be-

cause the strong coupling weakens at smaller distances, at sufficiently high density and temperature, hadrons

should dissolve into a deconfined state of quarks and gluons. This state of matter was named the Quark-Gluon

Plasma (QGP). The QGP is closely related to cosmology, as it is expected to be the state of the universe very

shortly after the Big Bang. This means that beside the interest of studying matter under extreme conditions, under-

standing the QGP can give insights into the earliest stages of the Universe. In order to recreate and study the QGP,

large temperatures and densities are needed. Both conditions can be achieved by colliding ultrarelativistic heavy

ions.


1.1.2.1      Heavy-ion variables

Before discussing the physics of heavy-ion collisions, it is useful to introduce quantities that are commonly used in

heavy-ion physics.

   (pseudo)rapidity

In high-energy collider experiments, beams are directed along a beam axis which is typically defined as the z-axis.

Collisions then occur between one beam with its momentum along the +z direction, and another beam with its

momentum along the −z direction. Colliding partons will generally not have equal momenta however, so that the

center-of-mass frame of the collision will be boosted along the z-axis. The rapidity of a particle is defined as

                                                                                     
                                                                 1           E + pz
                                                              y = ln                      ,                                               (1.1)
                                                                 2           E − pz

                                                                          7


where E is the energy of the particle and pz its momentum along the z-axis. The rapidity can be considered as a

relativistic measure of velocity. It is defined such that a rapidity of 0 means that the particle is traveling transverse

to the z-axis, and tends to ∞(−∞) when it travels along the positive (negative) z axis. Rapidity is not a lorentz

invariant quantity, although it has very useful properties. Namely, it changes by a constant under a longitudinal (i.e.

along the z-axis) Lorentz boost. This means that rapidity differences are a lorentz invariant quantity.

   Because a measurement of both the energy and the total momentum is necessary for the determination of

rapidity, it can be difficult to measure for highly relativistic particles. This is especially the case at large rapidity

for particles that travel close to the beam axis, and therefore to the beam pipe (where no detection elements are

present). A related quantity that is experimentally much more accessible was therefore defined. This quantity is

called the pseudorapidity and is defined as

                                                              
                                                               θ
                                                 η = − ln tan      ,                                                (1.2)
                                                               2

where θ is the angle between the particle and the z-axis. It can be shown that for ultrarelativistic particles (i.e. with

mass negligible compared to momentum), y ≈ − ln tan θ2 , so that y ≈ η. Only the angle relative to the beam axis
                                                          

has to be measured for the pseudorapidity, which is much simpler than measuring both the energy and momentum.

   Centrality, hNpart i and hNcoll i

Collisions between heavy ions can occur with different geometries, depending on the impact parameter b, which is

defined as the transverse distance between the center of the two nuclei. Based on the impact parameter, centrality

percentiles can be assigned as a percentage of the total nuclear interaction cross section.

   Related to the notion of centrality, a distinction is made between two types of nucleons: spectator nucleons which

do not encounter other nucleons and participant nucleons (also called wounded nucleons) which undergo at least

one scattering. The relation with the total number of nucleons is straightforward: hNspec i + hNpart i = NA + NB ,

where NA and NB represent the total number of nucleons in nuclei A and B. Because it is possible for a nucleon

to collide more than once, it proves useful to also define the number of binary collisions hNcoll i in an event. It has

been experimentally established that soft production scales with hNpart i, while hard probes scale with hNcoll i [3].

   The quantities hNpart i, hNcoll i, and hNspec i are closely related to the centrality percentile (impact parameter) of

an event, although they cannot be directly measured in experiments. However, given certain event properties they

can be estimated. The estimation of centrality, hNpart i and hNcoll i is based on Glauber Monte Carlo (MC) models [4].

The Glauber MC translates the centrality of an event to a mean charged particle multiplicity. In data, the latter can be

measured and therefore converted back to a centrality (or impact parameter) using the Glauber MC. This conversion

is shown in Figure 1.3.

   A fundamental assumption of the Glauber MC is that the charged particle multiplicity depends monotonically on

the impact parameter b. At low b, the nuclei collide head-on, and the resulting charged particle multiplicity is large.


                                                           8

(impact parameter) and hNpart i. The plotted distribution is illustrative and does not pertain to any specific measure-
ment. Figure taken from [4].


The corresponding centrality class has a low value, for example 0−5%. This kind of head-on event is called a central

event. Inversely, in the 80 − 90% centrality class, corresponding to large values of b, multiplicities are (relatively) low.

These events are called peripheral events.

   As a closing remark, any impact parameter dependence or centrality dependence in this thesis relates strictly to

quantities measured in collisions between heavy nuclei. In specialized analyses on proton–proton collisions, such

as Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering, an impact parameter dependence on the scale of the proton can be

taken into account. However, such a dependence lies outside the scope of this thesis.


1.1.2.2   Evolution of heavy-ion collisions

As mentioned before, the QGP can be created by colliding ultrarelativistic heavy ions. The time evolution of such

collisions, from the moment the ions collide up to the detection of particles in experiments will now be detailed.

Several phases occur following the collisions [5, 6], shown in Figure 1.4.

   Due to Lorentz contraction, the heavy ions are essentially flat discs. For large nuclei such as gold (Au) used at

RHIC and lead (Pb) used at the LHC, the diameter is 14 fm. The thickness of the discs is 14/γ fm, where γ is the

Lorentz factor, equivalent to 100 and 2500 at the highest RHIC, respectively LHC energies. As the heavy ions collide,

many interactions occur at soft scales (i.e. at low momentum transfer), while some occur at hard scales. The hard

interactions are responsible for the production of particles with large transverse momentum, which are called hard

particles or hard probes.

   1 fm/c after the collision, after the hard particles have been produced, the energy density rises to about 12

GeV/fm3 . This is more than twenty times the average energy density inside a hadron. The corresponding high

temperature and parton density lead to the formation of a QGP that is out of equilibrium. Although hydrodynamical

models can be used at this stage, their applicability and reliability is not well established.

   The next stage is that of a hydrodynamic QGP. Even though quarks and gluons are deconfined in the QGP,

they are not independent. One surprise was the discovery that quarks and gluons in the QGP behave like a

strongly coupled fluid, instead of like a gas-like fireball. The hydrodynamic phase is described by linearised viscous

hydrodynamics in which the QGP expands due to its high initial pressure after which it cools down.

   The hydrodynamic expansion phase lasts until the temperature becomes so low that quarks and gluons again

become confined within hadrons, which signals the formation of a hot hadron gas. The hadron gas further cools

down, while interactions between particles are still taking place. At some point, inelastic collisions no longer occur

so that the chemical composition of outgoing particles is fixed. This is called the chemical freeze-out. The hadrons

can still interact elastically, which can modify for example their pT spectra. Lastly, the kinetic freeze-out indicates

that even elastic collisions no longer take place. After the kinetic freeze-out, particles free stream to detectors where

Because the lifetime of the QGP is extremely short (∼10 fm/c at the LHC, ∼6 fm/c at RHIC [7]), it cannot be

directly observed. However, its presence and properties can be inferred from a multitude of measurements. In

this subsection, a small selection of such measurements is discussed. It is by no means a complete summary of

QGP probes and is only intended to briefly sketch the variety of measurements. An interested reader is invited to

read Refs. [3, 5, 8] and references therein for more detailed information. The characterization of the QGP can be


                                                               10


divided in roughly two categories of probes: hard and soft probes. The separation between the two is based on

the momentum transfer scales involved in the partonic scatterings. Hard probes involve momentum transfer scales

much larger than any energy scales present in the QGP medium and strictly originate from the initial nucleon–

nucleon collisions. Because they are formed earliest, they can traverse the QGP and interact with it. Moreover, due

to the large energy scales involved, their production can be computed within the pQCD framework which allows for

first-principle computations. On the other hand, soft probes elucidate bulk and dynamic properties of the QGP and

generally involve non-perturbative QCD.

   Hard probes

High-pT photons and EW bosons have been extensively studied in a multitude of collision configurations. In pp

collisons, their production cross section agrees well with pQCD calculations. In nucleus–nucleus (AA) collisions,

their production matches with expectations from the yield in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions

hNcoll i (also taking into account nuclear modifications of parton densities). Because both photons and the Z boson

lack color charge, this shows an understanding of the production mechanisms in pp and also provides credence for

the determination of hNcoll i using the Glauber MC. The production of Z bosons and nuclear modifications of parton

densities are an integral part of this thesis and will be outlined in more detail later.

   The comparison with colored probes such as jets, high-pT hadrons and heavy quarks then can provide informa-

tion about how the strongly interacting QGP affects colored probes that traverse it. When comparing yields of these

colored hard probes in AA collisions to those in pp (scaled by hNcoll i), it has been found that they are suppressed

in AA collisions. This phenomenon is called jet quenching, and arises from energy loss due to interactions with the

QGP.

   Soft probes

Particle correlations have been measured in AA and pp collisions. It has been observed that correlations are

stronger in AA collisions than what can be expected from a superposition of proton–proton collisions. The strength

of these correlations provide evidence for collective behavior in AA collisions due to the QGP. Azimuthal correlations

have been studied as a function of centrality, particle type, collision energy, rapidity and transverse momentum.

The observations can be described by relativistic hydrodynamics if the presence of a relativistic liquid is assumed.

From the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies, it has been established that the QGP does indeed behave like

a liquid. Moreover, it has an extremely low viscosity. The low viscosity allows for initial spatial anisotropies (due

to local fluctuations in nucleon density in the heavy ions) to persist to final state momentum anisotropies through

pressure-driven expansion of the liquid.


1.1.2.4   Recent developments in small systems

It is not sufficient to only study collisions between heavy nuclei to understand the QGP. Production mechanisms can

change due to nuclear environments, such that the description of proton–nucleus (pA) collisions already deviates


                                                            11


from that in pp collisions. Therefore, measurements of the same probe are generally done in three collision sys-

tems: proton–proton, proton–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus. The measurement in pp is considered as the baseline

reference, the measurement in pA as the baseline for cold nuclear matter effects (i.e. not due to the hot and dense

QGP) and AA signals the onset of QGP phenomena. In small systems (pp and pA), no QGP was originally expected

to form.

   However, in 2010 measurements showed that when selecting pp collisions with very high multiplicity, angular cor-

relations typically attributed to QGP could be observed [9]. The same behavior has since then also been observed in

high-multiplicity pA collisions (see [10] for an overview). Additionally, in 2016 it was observed that an enhancement

of strange hadrons, also typically associated with the presence of the QGP, could be found in high-multiplicity pp

and pA collisions [11]. The observation of such phenomena in small systems challenges the notion that in these

collision systems no QGP should be formed. It should be noted that these high-multiplicity events constitute a small

fraction of the total number of pp events (O(1%)) [12], so pp collisions can still safely be regarded as a baseline

without collective phenomena. The observations have encouraged new investigations to the minimum size neces-

sary for QGP formation, as well as how large energy densities could be created in pp collisions. A framework that

could potentially explain the phenomena is that of multi-parton interactions (MPI) [13]. The MPI framework is based

on the observation that at large energies, parton densities grow very rapidly. As a result, the probability for several

parton scatterings to occur during a single pp or pA collision increases. The scatterings can occur either at soft or

hard scales. Although the MPI framework predates the observations of the aforementioned azimuthal correlations

and strangeness enhancement, it has been suggested that it could be used to explain them. Much experimental

and theoretical effort is being put forward into understanding the appearance of collective phenomena in these small

systems [3, 14].




1.2        Particle production in proton–proton collisions

In the previous section, the running of the QCD coupling αs was discussed. At large momentum transfer, the value

of αs is small which allows for the computation of partonic cross sections using perturbative expansions. However,

free quarks and gluons do not exist in nature. Due to long-range interactions that occur at large values of αs , partons

are confined within hadrons. Perturbative QCD does not work for these large values of αs as higher order diagrams

are no longer negligible, leading to divergence of perturbative series. This poses an interesting challenge in the

computation of cross sections in QCD processes in hadron collisions, such as at the LHC.

   One of the frameworks thas has been established to nevertheless compute hadronic cross sections is the

collinear factorisation framework. In the collinear factorisation framework, hadronic cross sections are calculated

as the convolution of partonic cross sections with non-perturbative objects called parton distribution functions

mentum transfer, which indicates the energy scale of the interaction, and i indicates the parton flavor, which can

be either a quark or a gluon. The PDFs describe the number density (or more roughly speaking, the probability) of

a parton i at an energy scale Q2 . The PDFs describe the long-distance proton structure and are inherently non-

perturbative objects, so they cannot be computed from first principles. Instead, they are obtained through global fits

to various data from a multitude of experiments, including Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), Drell-Yan production of

electroweak bosons, jets and top quark pair production. Hadronic cross sections can then be obtained by [15]

fractions xa and xb evaluated at a factorisation scale of µ2F , σ̂ is the partonic cross section for a given combination

of mentioned variables and M represents the confinement scale, M ∼ 0.3 GeV. The factorisation scale µ2F indicates

the scale at which the PDFs are evaluated, and is typically set equal to the momentum transfer scale Q2 . The term

factorisation is used frequently in physics, where it indicates that a quantity can be computed as the convolution of

several factors. To be precise, Eq. 1.3 refers specifically to inclusive collinear factorisation [15]. The term inclusive

pertains to a technical detail relating to the cancellation of infrared infinities due to the emission of soft partons. An

intuitive interpretation of Eq. 1.3 is that the hadronic cross section is given by partonic cross sections σ̂ for partons a

and b, multiplied by the probabilities to find said partons (given by the PDFs), integrated over all values of momentum

fraction x.

   Before showing recent results from PDF fits, some technical aspects of factorisation are discussed. Firstly, it

should be noted that factorisation applies specifically to hard probes, where the partonic cross section can indeed be

computed using perturbative QCD. Secondly, factorisation relies on the principle that there is a separation between

the timescales in a hadron collision. An intuitive ’proof’ for factorisation is that the correlations of the momentum

distributions occur on long timescales, so that during the short timescale of the collision, the distributions can be

considered frozen [15]. However, formal proofs are mathematically very demanding and only exist in a limited

number of cases [16]. In general, factorisation is assumed and justified in retrospect if the theory describes the data

well. Thirdly, an important aspect of factorisation is that PDFs are assumed universal because they describe the

proton structure. They should therefore not depend on any specific hard process, and the same PDFs determined

from electron-proton DIS at HERA should be applicable in hadron collisions at the LHC. Lastly, the PDFs depend on

the momentum transfer scale Q2 . Normally this would mean that one would have to obtain each PDF at various Q2

to obtain the full dependence. Fortunately, a set of equations called the Dokshitzer–Gribov–Lipatov–Altarelli–Parisi

(DGLAP) equations, can be used to obtain the Q2 evolution of the PDFs given a starting scale Q20 [17–20].

   Figure 1.5 shows the most recent proton PDFs obtained by the CTEQ-TEA collaboration, evaluated at NNLO [21].

The PDFs are shown at two different energy/factorisation scales, which show qualitative similarities. At both energy

scales, there are two bumps visible at x ≈ 1/3 for the up and down quark distributions which correspond to the

valence quarks. Moving to lower x values, the density of all partons increases. In particular, the gluon PDFs grow

rapidly. Even though the gluon PDFs are divided by 5 for visibility, they dominate the other partons, especially at

large momentum transfer, as seen on the right plot.

     The increase of the PDFs at low x can be understood intuitively as follows. The value of Bjorken-x can be

shown to be approximately equal to Q2 /s where s is the center-of-mass energy of the colliding partons [22]. For

a fixed Q2 , low x therefore corresponds to a large center-of-mass energy. For ultrarelativistic particles, the center-

of-mass energy is proportional to the Lorentz boost γ. Because internal timescales are dilated by the γ factor, a

larger γ factor increases the lifetime of the QCD fluctuations (i.e. the gluons and sea quarks). As the lifetime of the

fluctuations grows, the probability for an interaction between a fluctuation and a probe increases. The end result is

that the proton is a denser object at higher energies and by correspondence lower bjorken-x.

     A separate factorization framework called the kT -factorisation exists, specifically for the computation of low-x

physics. Instead of an evolution in Q2 , the PDFs are evolved in x, given by the the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov

(BFKL) equation, which is a linear equation [23]. Some theories predict that the rise of the gluon PDFs at lower x

does not continue indefinitely. Instead, at some point the gluon fusion cross section should become equal to gluon

splitting cross section. This leads to a saturation of the gluon density, and the domain of physics is therefore called

saturation physics. One framework designed to understand and describe saturation physics is the Color-Glass

Condensate (CGC) model, which introduces non-linear effects to the BFKL equation at large gluon densities [24].

In this thesis however, the focus lies on the inclusive collinear factorization.

     Inclusive collinear factorisation in hadron collisions (as given by Eq. 1.3) is the starting point for the computation

of cross sections of hard probes. In the following, the production and decay of the Z boson and the J/ψ meson will

be discussed separately in more detail.

1.2.1     Z bosons



1.2.1.1   History and significance




The following is a condensed timeline of the theoretical conception and experimental discovery of the Z boson. The

information is principally taken from Refs [25] and [26]. An interested reader is invited to read them and references

therein for more detailed information.


   Already in 1934, long before the advent of the Standard Model, E. Fermi put forward an effective theory of the

weak force to describe β decays. In his effective theory, only charged weak interactions were considered. Some

30 years later in 1958, S. Bluman attempted to create a gauge theory describing weak interactions. The gauge

theory naturally led to the prediction of weak neutral currents. Shortly after in 1961, S. Glashow proposed an

electroweak theory to unify QED (electromagnetic) and weak interactions. As for Bluman’s theory, this required the

presence of a massive neutral boson, although at the time no mechanism was known to give rise to vector boson

masses without breaking certain symmetries in the theory. In 1964, R. Brout, F. Englert and P. Higgs presented

the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Through this mechanism, bosons could gain mass without

breaking the gauge theory. The mechanism was used simultaneously in 1967 by S. Weinberg and A. Salam in

what can be considered a precursor to the Standard Model, the Glashow-Salam-Weinberg model. The theory

necessitated both a neutral boson, which had still not yet been experimentally observed, as well as a boson related

to the symmetry breaking. The first experimental discovery of weak neutral currents was finally made in 1973 in the

Gargamelle bubble chamber experiment at CERN. Using a neutrino beam and a bubble chamber, neutrino–electron

and neutrino–hadron elastic collisions were observed. Ten years later in 1983, the first experimental discovery of

the W and Z bosons was made by the UA1 and UA2 collaborations at the Spp̄S collider at CERN. The discovery of

the three electroweak bosons was a crucial milestone that cemented the Standard Model as the correct description

of electroweak interactions. Lastly, the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 served as yet another confirmation of

the correctness of the Standard Model.


   After their discovery, the EW bosons were used to do precision measurements of SM predictions at the LEP and

SLAC colliders in the 1990s. For example, in the SM, EW couplings to electrons, muons and tauons are exactly

identical. This assumption is called lepton flavor universality, and was found to hold [27] (although later measure-

ments found a 2.6 σ discrepancy [28]). Another example is the invisible width of the Z boson, where SM calculations

showed good agreement with measured values. The invisible width of the Z boson is an interesting quantity because

it can be used to extrapolate the number of neutrino families. The theory predicts, and measurements show that

this number should be 3, which is also the number of families that have been observed so far.

1.2.1.2   Properties

Z bosons are the force carriers of the electroweak force, together with the W bosons and photons. They carry the

same quantum numbers of spin (+1) and electric charge (0) as the photon and carry no color charge. In contrast to

the massless photons, Z bosons have a mass of 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV/c2 [2].

   An aspect of Z bosons that makes them useful in experiments is their experimental signature. They can decay

into a pair of high-pT leptons with opposite sign with a branching ratio of 3.3662 ± 0.0066% [2]. Furthermore, the

decay products of Z bosons are in a kinematic regime where there is little background. In addition to that, their

cross sections at LHC energies are large, so that Z bosons can be measured experimentally with high precision.

Because the cross sections can be measured with high precision and theoretical predictions from QCD (discussed

in the next subsection) can be done with high accuracy, Z boson production can be used to calibrate detectors. As

such, the Z bosons (and also W bosons) have been nicknamed the ’standard candles’ of the LHC [21, 29]. An LHCb

measurement of Z bosons at forward rapidity and an ATLAS measurement of Z and W bosons at central rapidity,
                         √
both for pp collisions at s = 13 TeV are shown in Fig. 1.6 [30, 31]. Within uncertainties, the data are well described

by pQCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD and next-to-leading order (NLO) in QED.



1.2.1.3   Production mechanism

Z bosons are mainly produced through quark–antiquark annihilation, at the LHC. A special name is given to the

process where the Z boson subsequently decays to a lepton pair, namely the Drell-Yan process [32]. The Drell-Yan

process, shown in Figure 1.7 is a purely EW process at LO. Because the Z boson and photon have identical quantum

numbers, the Drell-Yan process can also occur through an intermediary virtual photon instead of a Z boson.

   The large mass of the Z boson has two consequences. First, even at the large LHC energies, Z bosons are

exclusively produced in the initial hard scatterings (in contrast to low-mass particles that can be produced thermally

or from initial/final state radiation). Secondly, the large mass of the Z boson requires a large momentum transfer.

Because αs is small at the Z boson mass (αs = 0.1179 ± 0.0010 [2]), a perturbative expansion in αs can be done.

This is necessary for the computation of QCD corrections to the production cross section, which are generally

larger than QED corrections. For comparison, the value of the QED coupling constant α at the Z-boson mass is
            1
α =   127.952±0.009   ≈ 0.0078 [2]. QCD corrections have been calculated up to NNLO, including a fully differential

description of the decay leptons [34]. NLO EW corrections have also been computed, which are comparable in size

to the NNLO QCD corrections (a rule of thumb is that αs2 ≈ α). Partial results of N3LO QCD corrections, as well as

mixed QCD-EW O(αs α) have already been obtained and full corrections are ongoing [35].

   As was mentioned before, the intermediary boson in the Drell-Yan process can be either a Z boson or a virtual

photon. Because the two processes q q̄ → Z → µµ and q q̄ → γ ∗ → µµ are physically indistinguishable, they must

both be included in production cross sections. In the theoretical computation of the cross section, their scattering

Figure 1.7: Drell-Yan process, in which a quark-antiquark pair from two hadrons annihilates into a virtual photon or
Z boson that decays into a lepton pair. Figure made using [33].


   During the 1950s and 1960s, large numbers of new particles were being detected. Suspecting that these parti-

cles were not elementary but rather composite, M. Gell-Man and G. Zweig introduced the quark model of hadrons

in 1964. In the model, three quarks (up, down and strange) were considered as the building blocks of all observed

hadrons. The quark model was able to explain measured meson and baryon spectra at the time. However, isolated

quarks had never been experimentally observed (which is now understood to be impossible due to confinement).

It was therefore not clear whether these quarks were mathematical book keeping tools or represented physical

particles. In addition to the quarks, the existence of four leptons (electrons, muons and their neutrino’s) had been

established.

   The quark model was able to explain many weak amplitudes, but there was a notable exception. It predicted

strangeness changing neutral currents, but experimentally these were not observed. In 1970, S. Glashow, J. Iliopou-

los and L. Maiani proposed the GIM mechanism that could explain the reason for this suppression2 . In order to do

so however, they required the existence of a fourth quark with charge 2/3e. Four years later in 1974, the J/ψ meson

was experimentally observed for the first time. The observation was done simultaneously by two separate research

groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stanford Linear Accelerator. In their publications, the particle was

named J and ψ respectively. Ultimately, both names were kept, leading to the name J/ψ.

   One surprising aspect of the J/ψ was its extremely narrow decay width and therefore long lifetime. For compar-

ison, other mesons which were known at the time, such as the ρ, ω and φ have masses around 1 GeV/c2 , close to

the J/ψ mass. Their lifetimes on the other hand, are three orders of magnitude smaller than that of the J/ψ. This

triggered lot of theoretical speculation and experimental activity. In the following year, more than 700 papers were

written related to the discovery of the J/ψ. This is now known as the November Revolution of 1974. In the end, the

discovery of the J/ψ played a fundamental role in the acceptance of quarks beyond mere bookkeeping tools and

consequently in the understanding of the fundamental structure of Nature.
  2 The   GIM mechanism also predicted the presence of neutral currents, mediated by a neutral weak boson.

1.2.2.2   Properties


Bound states of heavy quark and antiquark pairs are generally labeled quarkonium (plural: quarkonia). More specific

names corresponding to the quark flavors are commonly used, such as charmonia for charm-anticharm bound

states and bottomonia for bottom-antibottom bound states. Due to the large masses of c and b quarks, dynamical

properties of charmonia and bottomonia can be described by a non-relativistic potential model, called the Cornell

potential [40]. The Cornell potential is given by

where σ and κ are constants of the potential and r is the radial separation of the quarks. At short distances,

interactions are dominated by high-energy gluon exchanges so that the dynamics are perturbative. This leads to a
               κ
Coulomb-like   r   term in the potential. At long distances however, non-perturbative effects such as confinement are

modelled by a linear term in the potential. Similarly to the non-relativistic hydrogen atom, or positronium (which are

also two-particle bound states), many different states exist, giving rise to an emission spectrum. Using the Cornell

potential, a similar spectrum of charmonium can be computed, shown in Figure 1.9.

   The various charmonia are described by several distinct quantum numbers. States are described in spectro-

scopic notation as (n + 1)2S+1 LJ , where n indicates the principal quantum number, S the spin of the quarkonium,

L the orbital angular momentum and J the total angular momentum L + S. Quarkonia consist of a pair of quarks,

so that they can be either in a spin singlet (S = 0) or spin triplet (S = 1) state. The allowed values of the angular

momentum L are 0, 1, 2.., but they are generally denoted by the letters S, P, D... In the spectroscopic notation, the

J/ψ is denoted as 13 S1 . Alternatively, quarkonia can be classified by their parity P and charge conjugation C quan-

tum numbers, written as J P C . These are related to the values of angular momentum and spin by P = (−1)L+1 and

C = (−1)L+S . Quarkonia with the same J P C can have different values of n, which indicate excitations. This is the

case for the Ψ(2S) state, which is an excited state of the J/ψ (the J/ψ is also named the Ψ(1S) state).

   Although the J/ψ is a hadron, and can therefore decay strongly, it has a relatively long lifetime. There are several

reasons for this. First, the mass of the J/ψ is lower than that of any open charm mesons, which forbids decays to

other charmed mesons. Secondly, the J/ψ cannot decay into a single gluon, as the J/ψ is in a color singlet state,

while gluons are color octet states. Lastly, the strong interaction preserves charge parity C. Both the J/ψ and the

gluon have C = −1. C-parity is multiplicative, so a pair of gluons has C = +1, prohibiting the decay. The LO

gluon decay is therefore a decay into three gluons. The matrix element computed in Feynman diagrams is therefore

proportional to αs3 , suppressing the decays. As a result, EM decays become competitive with strong decays, leading

to a large branching ratio to muons of 5.961 ± 0.033 % [2].

   Another property of the J/ψ that can be measured and predicted is its polarisation. The J/ψ is a massive particle

with J = 1. If hypothetically the angular momentum were to be measured along a chosen quantisation axis z, the

projected angular momentum Jz could take on the values −1, 0, +1. If specific values of Jz are preferred over others,


                                                                                                             20


the J/ψ is said to be polarized. If the preferred values are Jz = ±1, the J/ψ is said to be transversely polarized, while

a preference for Jz = 0 is denoted as longitudinal polarization. If there is no preference, the J/ψ is said to be unpolar-

ized [41]. Because J/ψ’s are extremely shortlived, no such measurement can be done. However, the polarization of

J/ψ’s affects the angular distribution of their decay leptons. Because different production mechanisms (discussed in

the following subsection) predict different values of polarisation, measurements can be used to differentiate between

production models. Polarization is generally described by three parameters, λθ , λφ , λθφ , where θ is the polar angle

between the positive lepton and the chosen quantisation axis and φ azimuthal with respect to the hadron–collision

plane. The interpretation of these parameters depends on the quantization axis (or reference frame) chosen. In

the helicity frame, where the angular momentum is measured with respect to the momentum direction, transversely

polarised states are represented by λθ = 1, λφ = λθφ = 0, while λθ = −1, λφ = λθφ = 0 represents longitudinally

polarised states and λθ = λφ = λθφ = 0 represents unpolarised states. They affect the angular distribution of the

leptons through [42]

1.2.2.3   Production mechanisms

There are multiple ways through which J/ψ’s can be produced in pp collisions, and in the literature, several disct-

inctions are made. J/ψ’s that are created in the initial pp collisions are called direct prompt J/ψ’s. J/ψ’s are also

produced in decays of other quarkonia, such as the Ψ(2S) and χc mesons. These are referred to as indirect prompt

J/ψ’s, providing feed-down contributions. Both direct and indirect prompt J/ψ’s, are produced through the production

mechanisms detailed in this subsubsection. It is also possible for B hadrons to weakly decay into J/ψ’s, which is

called non-prompt production. Non-prompt production does not occur through charmonium production, and is there-

fore sensitive to different physical processes. Because they decay weakly, B hadrons have relatively long lifetimes,

which causes the decay vertex to be displaced by hundreds of microns [43]. Non-prompt production can therefore

experimentally be separated, given a detector with good vertex resolution. Lastly, the term inclusive J/ψ production

indicates that no separation between direct/indirect or prompt/non-prompt is made. The fraction of non-prompt over

inclusive J/ψ has been measured as a function of pT at different energies and rapidity windows. At pT ∼1 GeV/c, the

fraction is roughly 10% and steadily grows to 25% at pT ∼10 GeV/c. From there, the increase becomes stronger and

at pT ∼40 GeV/c, the non-prompt fraction is about 60% [44, 45].

   At the LHC, prompt J/ψ’s are mainly produced through gluon fusion [46] and their production can be described

by factorisation formulas such as Eq.1.3, similar to the production of Z bosons. One crucial difference however, is

that J/ψ’s are hadrons. This complicates the calculation of production cross sections, because after the formation

of a cc̄ pair, the pair needs to hadronise (i.e. form a bound state). Hadronisation occurs at low energy scales and

is therefore a non-perturbative process. This makes J/ψ (and quarkonia in general) production an ideal laboratory

to test the interplay between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD [47]. Several models have been created to

describe J/ψ production in hadronic collisions. In the following, the three main production models of quarkonium are

discussed. The three different models differ mainly in the way they treat hadronisation. They are the Color Singlet

Model (CSM), Color Evaporation Model (CEM) and effective field theory of non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD).


   Color Singlet Model (CSM)

Proposed already one year after the official discovery of the J/ψ in 1975, the color singlet model provided the first

evaluations of quarkonium production. In the CSM, it is assumed that the quantum numbers for colour and spin of

the quarkonium pair do not change during hadronisation. In other words, the heavy quark pairs are by assumption

produced in the color singlet state (i.e. colourless, as must be the case for physical hadrons), hence the name of

the model. The additional assumption is made that in the inertial frame of the quarkonium, both quarkonia are at

rest. Hadronisation is then described by a quarkonium wave function that is process and flavor independent. The

hadronic production cross section can then be calculated as [42]

where Q represents a quarkonium, R is the universal wave function, and all other indices are identical to those in

Eq. 1.3. The two formulae are in principle identical, beside the addition of the wave function.


   An attractive feature of the CSM is that the aforementioned wave function is universal. It does not change

between processes or kinematic regimes, so that the same wave function can be used to describe the production

of J/ψ, Ψ(2S), Υ(1S), Υ(2S) and Υ(3S) which are the 3 S1 states as well as ηc and ηb which are singlet states. The

wave function is non-perturbative, but because it appears in decay processes, it can be extracted from decay-width

measurements. Once the wave function is obtained, the CSM becomes highly predictive.


   Color Evaporation Model Model (CEM)

The CEM was first introduced only 3 years after the discovery of the J/ψ, in 1977. The CEM assumes that all heavy

quark pairs hadronise into quarkonia if they have an invariant mass less than the threshold of producing a pair of

open heavy flavor mesons. A fundamental difference with the CSM is that the quark pair QQ̄ is not required to be

produced with the quantum numbers of the final hadron. Instead, the quark pair can be produced in a color octet

state and by emitting soft gluons (therefore non-perturbatively) lose its color. Through this process, the quark pair

ends up in the color singlet state, having ’evaporated’ away its color. In the CEM, the quantum numbers of the heavy

quark pair and quarkonia are therefore decorrelated, and the probability for a heavy quark pair to end up in a specific

state is given by PQ . This probability is assumed to be universal for each state. The production cross section in the

CEM is then given by

   Historically, a drawback of the CEM is that it did not describe polarisation, which is an important requirement

for a production model. However, recent developments have started to incorporate mechanisms through which the

CEM model can yield polarised quarkonia [42].

   Non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD)

In 1995, a new framework was proposed in which aspects of both CSM and CEM were included [48]. Making

use of the fact that quarkonia are bound states of heavy quarks, a non-relativistic framework built on QCD was

established. In NRQCD, a similar factorisation is assumed as for CSM, but instead of a universal wave function,

hadronisation is described using universal long-distance matrix elements (LDME’s). Hadronic production cross

sections are computed as

where the partonic cross section obtains an extra dependency on an unphysical scale µΛ , and hOQ i represents the

   As in the CEM, transitions from color octet states to the final physical meson are allowed. The addition of these

color octet states allows for the cancellation of divergences present in the CSM. The sum in Eq. 1.8 therefore is

also over the quantum numbers for spin, color and angular momentum which are all denoted by n. Obtaining the

LDMEs is a more challenging task than obtaining the CSM wave functions, because LDMEs cannot be extracted

from decay-width measurements or from lattice QCD calculations. Only relations from Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry

allow for the extraction of the LDMEs.

   In principle, a sum over an infinite number of LDMEs must be done in order to obtain cross sections. However, the

sum over n is typically organised in powers of the relative quark velocity v (in addition to the well-known expansion

in αs ). NRQCD therefore uses a double expansion in v and αs , truncating computations at a given order for either

variable. If only the leading order in v is considered, and only those quantum numbers where the heavy quark pair is

the same as the quarkonium, NRQCD yields the CSM predictions. The non-relativistic approach is justified through

estimates of the relative quark velocities, which are v 2 ≈ 0.3 for charmonia and v 2 ≈ 0.1 for bottomonia [47]. For

single inclusive J/ψ hadroproduction, relativistic corrections to the pT distribution of cross sections for CS modes

are negligible [49].

describe the data. In subsequent years, higher order NLO and NNLO* (i.e. partial NNLO) corrections to the CSM

were computed. A striking finding is that these higher order corrections do not influence the total cross section

much, although their impact on the pT distributions is very significant [47]. In case the full NNLO CSM corrections

are close to the partial NNLO* corrections, the CSM alone is enough to explain the pT distribution at low and mid

pT . The significant NLO and NNLO corrections do raise doubts for the convergence of the perturbative series

in αs . Large uncertainties, both in the CSM and in the COM of NRQCD, ultimately do not allow for any strong

conclusions on the dominant production mechanism. The dominance of either is important to establish what the

polarisation of the J/ψ should be. Measurements indicate that J/ψ are produced unpolarised (some indicate a light

longitudinal polarisation), while the CSM predicts longitudinally polarised J/ψ and the COM in NRQCD predicts

transverse polarisation at high pT (all in the helicity frame).


1.2.2.4   Associated production

As experimental and theoretical studies have progressed, increasingly more precise measurements and predictions

have been made. However, a number of challenges still remain in the understanding of quarkonium production.

New observables have been suggested, going beyond cross section measurements of single quarkonium. Instead,

measurements of a quarkonium in combination with other particles (called associated production) are considered

promising to a better understanding of quarkonium production mechanisms. For example, J/ψ + J/ψ production

is expected to be dominated by CSM contributions while J/ψ + Υ is dominated by COM contributions [50]. Such

measurements therefore provide separation power between the various single production modes. Furthermore,

new constraints on NRQCD LDMEs can be obtained from associated production, as the LDMEs appear in different

combinations than in single production [42]. The focus in this thesis will lie mainly on J/ψ + J/ψ pair (also called di-

J/ψ) production. The production cross section for di-J/ψ production is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of

single J/ψ production. A kinematical reason for this is that a larger mass needs to be produced in the collision, which

thereby reduces the possible phase space. Another reason is that in perturbative computations, di-J/ψ production

generally starts at a higher order in αs , compared to single J/ψ production [51].

   The production mechanisms for single J/ψ’s (and quarkonia in general) have been outlined already. In all three

mechanisms, J/ψ production occurs through the interaction of two initial partons. From such a single scattering,

Feynman diagrams that include the production of two J/ψ’s can be made. An example is shown in Fig. 1.10-left.

This process is called Single Parton Scattering (SPS). At LHC energies, gluon densities of the proton are very large

(as shown in Fig. 1.5) and it becomes possible for several separate parton scatterings to occur during one single


                                                            24


proton–proton collision. In general, this is referred to as Multi-Parton Interactions (MPI). In this thesis, the focus

lies on MPI involving two separate scatterings, which is referred to as Double Parton Scattering (DPS), shown in

Fig.1.10-right. In both SPS and DPS, gluon fusion is considered to be the dominant mode of production of di-J/ψ’s

at LHC energies [51]. Di-J/ψ production can help understand dynamics at which multiple parton scattering becomes

important at LHC energies [52]. It can also be used as a tool to probe polarised gluon momentum distribution

through azimuthal asymmetries, even in unpolarised protons [53].

   Although both SPS and DPS are considered to contribute to di-J/ψ production, they do so in different kinematic

regimes. In the following, the SPS and DPS mechanisms will be discussed separately.

   Single Parton Scattering

As for the single J/ψ production, CS and CO contributions can be computed for the di-J/ψ production cross section.
                                                                                                   J/ψ
However, CO contributions are generally considered negligible in SPS calculations, at least for pT       < 50 GeV/c [42].

Even including QCD corrections at NLO, CEM contributions remain dominated by CSM contributions. No full NLO

NRQCD COM computations have been done yet, but strong similarities to the CEM computations are expected [55].

On the other hand, partial NLO evaluations, referred to as NLO* have been done for CS channels, where they were

found to significantly enhance LO differential cross sections [52]. In summary, the CS contribution is expected to

dominate the SPS channels of di-J/ψ production. This means that di-J/ψ production could be used to separate CS

and CO production channels [56].

   As mentioned before, di-J/ψ production generally occurs at higher orders of αs . For example, the LO CSM

contribution to single J/ψ production is αs3 , while the LO contribution for di-J/ψ production in CSM instead occurs at

αs4 , as shown in Fig. 1.11.

   Beside offering separation power between CS and CO contributions, di-J/ψ production can also help to constrain

feeddown contributions. The initial gluons are in the color singlet state and have even C-parity. This allows for

the production of J/ψ, ηc or χc pairs, while prohibiting the production of quarkonium pairs of different C-parity such

as J/ψ + ηc or J/ψ + χc . This consequently affects the feeddown from J/ψ + ηc states, while ηc + ηc feeddown is

on the right plot in Fig. 1.11) such mixed C-parity combinations can be produced.

   Double Parton Scattering (DPS)

Typically in the framework of inclusive collinear factorisation, it is assumed that one hard scattering occurs during

a hadron-hadron collision, along with multiple soft interactions. The justification for this assumption is that the

probability of a single hard scattering is already small, so that the probability for two hard scatterings to occur

should be highly suppressed. However, due to the large gluon densities at high energies (or conversely, low x),

this assumption becomes increasingly difficult to justify [57]. At the LHC, it is expected that DPS can provide a

substantial contribution to di-J/ψ production (at least in certain kinematic regimes).

   In the DPS framework, it is assumed that double scatterings can be factorized as two uncorrelated SPS, in a

similar way to Eq. 1.3. The general formula for the production cross section then becomes

where σP1 is the hadronic cross section for single production of P. Given single production cross sections, the DPS

cross section can be computed from Eq.1.14. From the equation, it follows directly that the spectra (versus pT or

rapidity) in DPS should be equivalent to those in single J/ψ. By measuring the single cross section of two particles

σP1 and σP2 , as well as their associated cross section σP1 P2 , the effective cross section σeff can be computed using
                                     DPS
Eq. 1.14. However, the DPS fraction σP1 P2
                                           must first be determined for this. The DPS fraction is generally estimated

from template fits to the associated production [58, 59].

   Equation 1.14 provides an intuitive explanation for the importance of DPS at high energies. The reason is that

each of the σ’s in the equation contains two parton PDFs so that the DPS cross section is roughly proportional to

the fourth power of PDFs. Due to the rapid rise of the PDFs at high energy (low x), DPS is considered to grow

more strongly as a function of energy than SPS [57, 60]. However, it should be noted that there are some caveats

to the equation. First, although factorisation has been shown to hold in SPS, proofs in DPS are still an ongoing

effort [60]. Secondly, some of the simplifying assumptions, such as the irrelevance of parton correlations have been

questioned [61]. Furthermore, the given definition of σeff is computed under the assumption that it only depends

on transverse correlations in proton, and should therefore be process independent. However, some tension exists

between the extraction of σeff from different data sets. The extraction from processes sensitive to quark PDFs yield

smaller values of σeff , than those from processes sensitive to gluon PDFs. This could potentially be rooted in a

flavor dependence [43, 52].

   It is currently expected that DPS contributions dominate over SPS contributions at large values of ∆y between

the J/ψ’s and also at large di-J/ψ invariant masses MJ/ψJ/ψ [52].


                                                                       27


1.3       Modification of particle productions in heavy nuclei collisions

In the previous sections, production mechanisms of Z bosons and J/ψ (mesons) in proton–proton collisions were

discussed. In collisions involving heavy nuclei these production mechanisms can change. Changes can occur due

to final state effects, such as interactions with the QGP, or due to initial state effects from the heavy nuclei. The

distinction is made between QGP-related effects, which are called hot nuclear effects and non-QGP-related effects,

called cold nuclear matter effects (CNM). Although there are exceptions, proton–nucleus (pA) collisions are typically

used to study CNM effects, as no QGP is expected to form in these collisions. AA collisions are sensitive to both

CNM and hot effects. Measurements in all three systems (pp, pA and AA) are therefore important to disentangle

the cold and hot effects from the proton–proton baseline. In the following, a selection of cold and hot nuclear matter

effects are discussed.




1.3.1     Cold Nuclear Matter effects

1.3.1.1   nuclear PDFs


In 1983, the European Muon Collaboration measured the structure functions F2 of iron and deuterium. The structure

function is closely related to PDFs through F2 (x) = q e2q fq (x), where eq is the charge of a parton q and f its PDF.
                                                    P

Theoretical expectations at the time were that the ratio of structure functions in iron and deuterium should be

unity, indicating that a naive counting of nucleons should yield predictions for nuclei. However, the measurement

exhibited a clear departure from unity, with a depletion in iron at large x and an enhancement at low x. Although

several explanations were proposed for this departure, it has since been well established that parton distributions

are different in free nucleons than nucleons bound in nuclei [62]. As a result, cross section computations in the

inclusive collinear factorization framework require nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) which are different from the free-nucleon

PDFs.

   There are two main approaches to parametrize nuclear PDFs. The first is to define a nuclear modification ratio

with respect to known proton PDFs [63]

where i indicates a parton (either a quark or gluon), R the nuclear modification ratio, and f p/A and f p the bound

proton (in nucleus A) and free-proton PDFs, respectively. Alternatively, the bound proton PDF can be obtained by a

direct parametrization of the distributions, in the same way as for free-nucleon PDFs [64]. An example of this is

   An example of the nuclear modification factor RiA (x, Q2 ) = fi            (x, Q2 )/fip (x, Q2 ) is shown in Figure 1.12. Four

distinct regions in x can be separated. At x / 0.05, a depletion is present in bound nucleons compared to free

nucleons. This region is called the shadowing region. At 0.05 / x / 0.3, an enhancement in the so-called anti-

shadowing region is seen. After this, the EMC region (the x-range where the original effect was measured) shows

another depletion in 0.3 / x / 0.9. Lastly, in the Fermi region x ' 0.9, an enhancement is seen. It should be noted

that the given values of the transition points between the different regions are only rough estimates. The precise

values depend on the parton flavor and energy scale and are subject to uncertainties in the nPDF modeling. In

some cases, even the qualitative behavior can change, and the distinction into four regions does not hold. As a

sidenote, in nuclei it is possible for a parton to have x > 1 due to Fermi motion of nucleons in a nucleus. However,

because data are generally not sufficient to constrain nPDFs at x > 1, nPDF models are generally presented at

0 < x < 1 [15].

   Almost 40 years after the discovery of nuclear modifications to free-proton PDFs, the physical mechanisms re-

sponsible for the various enhancements and depletions are not yet fully understood. Shadowing and antishadowing

have been proposed to originate from multiple scattering effects. The scattering amplitudes of quarks can interfere

destructively, leading to a depletion (shadowing) or interfere constructively, leading to an enhancement (antishad-

owing) [66]. For the EMC effect, despite many proposed ideas in the 1980s, few remain viable. One possible

mechanism originates from differences in the strong Lorentz scalar and vector mean fields that are known to exist

in a nucleus. Another explanation comes from short-range correlations from nucleons that are far off the mass

shell [67]. Lastly, the Fermi region is expected to be related to the Fermi motion of nucleons inside a nucleus [68].

Although theoretical advances have been made, the journey to a clear understanding of the physical origin of the

nuclear effects is still in progress.

   Nuclear PDFs, like their free-nucleon PDF counterparts, are non-perturbative objects that are obtained from

global fits to data. EW bosons are sensitive to quark (and antiquark) distributions and are therefore useful tools

to constrain nPDF fits. In addition to EW bosons, heavy-flavor mesons (which are sensitive to gluon distributions,

particularly at low x) have been proposed to constrain nPDFs [69].

   Overview of nPDF models

Throughout the years, different nPDF models have been created. They differ in the datasets included in the fits, as

well as the nPDF parametrisation (as discussed before). An overview of a selection of nPDFs will now be given.

   The EPS09s [70] and EPPS16 [63] are two nPDF models that are defined with respect to free-nucleon PDFs,

as given by Eq. 1.15. The free-nucleon PDF set commonly used is that of CT14NLO [71]. EPPS16 is a more

recent nPDF set and includes more data. Specifically, it contains data from p–Pb measurements on di-jets and

W/Z bosons in LHC Run-1, as well as data from neutrino DIS experiments. Additionally, EPPS16 has independent

flavor parametrization, both for valence and sea quarks. No such flavor separation is done in EPS09s, where

only 3 nuclear modifications are considered: a universal modification of valence quarks, a universal modification of

sea quarks and a universal modification of gluons. EPPS16 exclusively provides values integrated over the whole

nucleus, meaning no impact parameter (centrality) dependence is taken into account in the nuclear modifications. In

contrast, EPS09s takes into account a spatial dependence of the nPDFs and therefore is able to provide centrality

dependent predictions.

   The NCTEQ15 nPDFs are an independent parametrisation (i.e. no anchor PDF set is necessary), according to

Eq. 1.16. Similarly to EPPS16, the NCTEQ15 nPDFs contain independent parametrization of up and down valence

quarks. However, they contain no separate light sea quark parametrization which reduces theoretical uncertainties

at the cost of potentially biaising the calculations. The data included in NCTEQ15 fits are similar to those included

in the EPS09s nPDFs. This means that the neutrino DIS and LHC p–Pb data were not used in the fits. As was the

case for EPPS16, the NCTEQ15 values are computed integrated over the entire Pb–nucleus.

   As new data and theoretical techniques become available, new nPDFs are released and existing nPDFs are

updated. A brief discussion is given of nPDFs that have been released after the analysis (described in Chapter 3)

was completed. A new version of the NCTEQ15 nPDFs called NCTEQ15WZ was released a year after the analysis

was done [72]. In NCTEQ15WZ, LHC W and Z boson data were added to the global fits. New electroweak measure-

ments have been performed after its release, so that not all LHC W and Z data are included in NCTEQ15WZ. The

EPS09s, EPPS16 and nCTEQ15(WZ) nPDFs mentioned so far are at NLO order, but nPDFs at higher order have

also been computed. One such example is the KA15 nPDF [73] whose recent successor is the KSAG20 nPDF [74].

Another nPDF, based on machine learning techniques is nNNPDF1.0 [75] is also at NNLO order. Lastly, an open-

source nPDF at NNLO called TUJU has been released [76]. Although these nPDFs are computed at NNLO, the

data sets used in the fits are only from deep inelastic scattering or Drell-Yan measurements. As a result, they lack

certain constraints that are present in the NLO nPDFs, most notably direct gluon constraints [77]. Efforts to include

a larger diversity in data are ongoing. For example, the successor of nNNPDF1.0 called nNNPDF2.0 was recently

released, in which a variety of RHIC and LHC data was added to the nPDFs [78]. However, their inclusion was done

at NLO. As can be seen, the development of nuclear PDFs is in constant evolution.

   Table 1.1 shows an overview of the similarities and differences of the various nPDFs discussed.



1.3.1.2   Cronin effect

To quantify deviations between particle production in p–A collisions and pp collisions, the RpA is used. It is defined
             N pA
as RpA =   hTpA iσpp ,   where N pA is the yield of an observable in p–A collisions, σpp the corresponding cross section

in pp collisions and hTpA i the nuclear overlap function. In p–A collisions, partons from the proton can undergo

multiple scattering with several partons in the nucleus, from which they gain additional transverse momentum. Con-

sequently, in the pT distribution of the RpA of charged particles, a depletion is seen at low pT and an enhancement

at intermediate pT (∼ 3 − 5 GeV/c). This is known as the Cronin effect [81]. At high pT , the RpA goes to unity, as

so-called higher twist effects (which are responsible for multiple scattering) are suppressed by powers of pT . An

ALICE measurement has shown that at LHC energies, the Cronin effect is small and that the data are consistent

with no enhancement at intermediate pT [82].



1.3.1.3   Nuclear absorption

Even without the presence of a QGP, a quarkonium produced inside a nucleus environment can interact with the

nucleons and dissociate. The consequent suppression of quarkonia is called nuclear absorption. The survival prob-

ability of a pre-resonant quarkonium is related to the absorption cross section σabs which depends on the crossing

time of the collisions. The absorption cross section decreases with energy, as the crossing time decreases [83].

At LHC energies, the crossing time is expected to be so short that the quarkonia are mostly formed outside of the

nuclei. As a result, nuclear absorption is expected to be negligible at the LHC [84].

1.3.1.4   Cold energy loss



A cold nuclear medium induces an energy loss on outgoing particles through gluon radiation. Hard processes

in p–A collisions are sensitive to two different regimes of gluon radiation timescales [85]. There is the Landau-

Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) regime, which corresponds to gluon formation timescales of the order of the length of

the nuclear medium tf . L, and the factorisation regime which corresponds to tf  L. The latter gluon radiation

is also named fully coherent radiation. The LPM regime is associated with initial and final state energy loss, and

its contributions are expected to vanish in high-energy collisions. On the other hand, fully coherent radiation is

associated with interference of gluons from incoming particles, produced long before entering the medium, and

outgoing particles. The fully coherent radiation could play a key role in the suppression of colored hard probes in

p–A collisions. For example, J/ψ suppression in h–A collisions can be described by fully coherent radiation [85]. In

contrast, Drell-Yan production in p–A collisions occurs through a colorless hard probe, so that it is not sensitive to

fully coherent radiation. Drell-Yan production in p–A collisions could therefore be sensitive to the LPM regime.




1.3.2     Hot Nuclear Matter effects


1.3.2.1   Effects on Z bosons



The production time of the Z boson is inversely proportional to its mass ∼1/MZ ∼10−3 fm/c and has a decay time of

0.08 fm/c, while the QGP forms after 1 fm/c. This means that Z bosons are produced and decay before the QGP is

formed so that they cannot interact with it. Their leptonic decays carry no color charge and therefore do not interact

strongly with the QGP. On the other hand, the charged leptons can interact electromagnetically with the QGP.

Calculations show that lepton energy loss is of the order of tens of MeV [86]. Additionally, an ATLAS measurement

has shown an observed momentum broadening of µ+ µ− pairs from photon decays [87]. The scale of the broadening

was found to be kt = 70 ± 10 MeV. However, it has been shown that this broadening could also be explained by more

detailed modeling of the incoming photon fluxes, removing the need to invoke EM rescatterings [88, 89]. Regardless

of the origin of the momentum broadening, it should be noted that typical momentum scales of the leptonic decays

of the Z bosons are around 40 GeV/c (half its mass), so that any such broadening can experimentally be ignored in

any case.

   The lack of sensitivity to final state strong and EM effects means that Z bosons in leptonic decay channels can

be used to study initial state effects. This makes them ideal tools for nPDF measurements, both in p–A and A–A

collisions.

1.3.2.2   Effects on J/ψ


Although not the main topic of this thesis, the study of J/ψ production in heavy ion collisions is interesting in its own

right as it allows to indirectly probe the temperature of the QGP. This is done by a number of effects that will be

discussed now.

Debye Screening

The static cornell potential, as given by Eq. 1.4 applies to heavy quark pairs in vacuum. In a hot and dense QCD

medium, the potential is modified in two ways. First, the hot medium reduces the string tension σ to 0. Secondly,

the high density of colored charges creates a screen between the two heavy quarks. This is known as Debye
                                                                    −κ                                        −κ −r/rD
screening. This is reflected in the potential by the Coulomb-like    r   term becoming a Yukawa-like term      r e     ,

where rD is the Debye screening length, which is inversely proportional to the QGP temperature T [84]. When the

radial distance of the quark pair exceeds the screening length, the pair dissociates, which suppresses quarkonia

production. Different quarkonia have different binding energies and therefore dissociation lengths. Measurements

of a variety of quarkonia can consequently act as a QGP thermometer. In more advanced analyses, the heavy

quark potential gains imaginary terms as well [84].

Collisional dissociation

The Debye screening explained above applies to quarkonium dissociation in a static medium. Dynamic dissociation

can also occur, from interactions between a heavy quark pair and partons in the QGP. There are two main processes

through which this dynamic dissociation takes place [84]. The first is gluon dissociation where a thermal gluon

from the QGP is absorbed by the heavy quark pair. If the gluon is energetic enough, the binding energy can be

overcome, dissociating the bound state. Alternatively, inelastic parton scattering can also dissociate heavy quark

pairs. However, not only partons can induce quarkonium suppression. Inelastic collisions with secondary particles

such as π or ρ mesons (called comovers) in a hot and dense medium can also dissociate quarkonia [84].

   Regeneration
                                                                       √

collisions at sNN = 200 GeV at RHIC and in Pb–Pb collisions at sNN = 2.76 TeV and sNN = 5.02 TeV at LHC,

a puzzle appears. The suppression is similar between SPS and RHIC, even though the collision energy is roughly

10 times larger in the latter. The larger collision energy should lead to a higher temperature QGP, and therefore

a larger suppression. More puzzling is the fact that at the LHC, the observed suppression is smaller than at SPS

and RHIC [84, 90]. To make sense of this behavior, the regeneration mechanism was proposed. Charm quark

production is expected to be small at SPS, while more than 10 cc̄ quark pairs are expected to be produced in central

Au–Au collisions at RHIC, and more than 100 in central Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC. Charm quarks from one pair

can then form quarkonia with anticharm quarks from another pair, which enhances charmonium production.

   In the end, a complex interplay of J/ψ production enhancement and suppression at different pT regimes can help

1.4     Existing measurements

1.4.1    EW bosons

Numerous measurements of electroweak bosons have been done at the LHC. The analysis of Z bosons is generally

easier to do due to the decay into a high-pT lepton pair with opposite charge, which is easy to detect. On the other

hand, W-boson measurements are experimentally more involved because they entail the measurement of a single

high-pT charged lepton. Then, either the accompanying (anti)neutrino has to be measured through the reconstruc-

tion of missing energy or the pT distribution of the charged lepton is fitted with models obtained from simulations.

The main benefit of W bosons is their production cross section, which is larger than that of Z bosons. ATLAS mea-

surements at mid-rapidity indicate that the W+ -boson cross section multiplied by the single-lepton branching ratio is

roughly 6 times larger than that of Z bosons multiplied by the leptonic branching ratio. For the W− , the production

is roughly 4 times larger [31, 91]. The larger cross sections lead to measurements with higher experimental preci-

sion than Z-boson measurements, which in turn lead to better constraining power for nPDFs. In this subsection, a

non-exhaustive selection of measurements is shown. First, measurements in ALICE are discussed and after that,

measurements at LHCb, ATLAS and CMS are presented.

   Measurements in ALICE

The separate measurements done in ALICE will be presented based on the boson and collision system. Measure-

ments of Z bosons and W bosons in p–Pb collisions are discussed first, followed by a Z-boson measurement done

in Pb–Pb.
                                                                          √               √
   Measurements on Z bosons have been done in p–Pb collisions at       sNN = 5.02 TeV and sNN = 8.16 TeV,
                                                                                    √
at forward rapidity and backward rapidity [92, 93]. The integrated luminosity in the sNN = 5.02 TeV dataset

is 5.03 ± 0.18nb−1 at forward rapidity, and 5.81 ± 0.20nb−1 at backward rapidity, while it is 8.40 ± 0.16nb−1 and
                    √
12.74 ± 0.24nb−1 at sNN = 8.16 TeV. The measured cross sections were compared with models that include

nuclear modifications to PDFs and those without (although they do include isospin). All model predictions are close

to each other and agree with the data, as seen in Fig.1.13. The similarity of the predictions is attributed to the fact

that only one nucleon is sampled from a nuclear PDF. Furthermore, at backward rapidity, multiple nPDF effects occur

that enhance and deplete free-nucleon PDFs so that in the end they tend to cancel each other. On the other hand, at

forward rapidity, mainly shadowing is probed so that the nPDF predictions are lower than free-nucleon predictions.

Within experimental uncertainty, both models with and without nuclear modifications successfully described the

data. No strong conclusions can therefore be drawn regarding the presence of nuclear modifications of PDFs.

   W bosons have also been measured in the same datasets mentioned above, and are shown in Fig. 1.14. For

boson at forward rapidity is even smaller than the theoretical uncertainty on one of the nPDF models, which allows

   In summary, with the exception of Z-boson measurements in p–Pb collisions which are compatible with both free-

nucleon and nPDF models, ALICE measurements show a preference for nPDF models. This is more pronounced at

forward rapidity, where the shadowing effect (which leads to a depletion in nPDFs) is probed. In particular, W+ boson
                                                         √
measurements at forward rapidity in p–Pb collisions at sNN = 8.16 TeV have smaller experimental uncertainties

than theoretical uncertainties and therefore have the potential to constrain nPDFs. Z-boson measurements in Pb–Pb

collisions are well described by nPDFs, but offer no constraining power.

Z bosons in p–Pb collisions at sNN = 5.02 TeV have also been measured by LHCb, with an integrated luminosity

of 1.099±0.021nb−1 at forward rapidity and 0.521±0.011nb−1 at backward rapidity [96]. The measured cross section

is shown in Fig. 1.16 (left). The conclusions are similar to those drawn in the ALICE measurements: no definitive

statements about preferences for models including or excluding nuclear modifications can be made.

forward and backward yields were combined to obtain the forward-backward ratio Nµ (+ηCM )/Nµ (−ηCM ) shown

in Fig. 1.16 (right). As can be seen in the figure, experimental uncertainties are much smaller than theoretical

uncertainties and the deviations from free-nucleon predictions are large. This provides strong constraining power

for nPDF models.

J/ψ pair production has been studied in a number of experiments (See Refs [98, 99] and references therein). DPS

contributions are sizeable but strong conclusions are difficult to draw due to large theoretical uncertainties. In many

cases, the CSM LO + NLO contributions already exceed the measured di-J/ψ cross sections, such that the need

for large DPS contributions is reduced [52]. Nonetheless, in certain kinematic regimes such as large ∆y, J/ψ pair

production is expected to be dominated by DPS. Two such examples are shown in Figure 1.17.

Figure 1.17: Expected contribution of SPS and DPS to di-J/ψ production as a function of rapidity difference between
the two J/ψ. The left plot is taken from [43], while the right plot is taken from [52].


   In the simplest DPS framework, σeff is expected to be independent of processes and energy. However, various

extractions yield different values of the effective cross section. It was suggested in [43] that this could originate from

a flavor dependence. This was evidenced by the fact that extractions from processes that were dominated by gluon

distributions (such as di-quarkonium, or 4-jet production) were different from those from processes dominated by

quark distributions (such as W + jet and γ + jet). However, in [100] it was shown that there is already a disagreement

between various measurements that are dominated by gluon distributions. Figure 1.18 shows the determination of

σeff from various measurements, indicating that its universality might not hold.

2.1        LHC

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle collider located at the Franco-Swiss border operated by the European

Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)1 . The physics goals of the LHC stretch over a wide range of fundamental

topics. They include open questions relating to the origin of particle mass (for which the discovery of the Higgs-boson

is an important milestone [104, 105]), the existence of dark matter, the existence of supersymmetrical particles, the

matter-antimatter asymmetry and the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The LHC is a circular collider,

with a circumference of 27 km. It is currently the world’s largest and most powerful accelerator. Protons can be
                              √                                                          √
accelerated up to an energy of s = 7 TeV, corresponding to a center-of-mass energy of s = 14 TeV in proton–

proton collisions. The LHC was also designed to accelerate and collide Pb-nuclei. Collisions between the latter can
                                                         √
reach center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair of up to sNN = 5.52 TeV [106]. Additionally, asymmetric p–Pb

beams and Xe–Xe beams have also been collided, even though they were not originally included in the LHC design

[107, 108].

   The LHC houses several experiments at the various Interaction Points (IP) where the beams collide. There are

the ATLAS and CMS experiments, both of which use a general purpose detector to cover a wide range of physics. In

addition there is the ALICE experiment which specializes in QGP/heavy-ion physics as well as the LHCb experiment

which focuses on CP violation. Furthermore, three smaller experiments can be found close to some of the mentioned

main detectors. The TOTEM experiment, close to the CMS IP, is dedicated to the measurement of the proton-proton

total cross section, elastic scattering and diffraction dissociation in the forward direction. These measurements will

help in better understanding the structure of protons. Then, near the ATLAS IP is the LHCf experiment, with the

main aim of precisely measuring the production spectra of neutral particles in the forward direction. This will allow

to simulate and test cosmic ray shower models which are used by ground-based cosmic ray experiments. Lastly, in

the neighborhood of the LHCb detector is the MOEDAL detector whose purpose is to directly search for magnetic

monopoles as well as exotic BSM particles.

   The hadrons that will eventually collide are not directly injected into the LHC for acceleration. Instead, they

first go through a series of smaller accelerators, gradually increasing their energy before being injected into the

LHC, where the final acceleration takes place. Furthermore, atoms such as Pb and Xe need to be stripped of their

electrons so that only the nuclei remain. This happens concurrently with the acceleration and is also done in phases.

The accelerator scheme is shown in Fig. 2.1.

   The LHC is comprised of two concentric rings in which counter-rotating beams are injected and accelerated. A

complex system of magnets and electric fields is necessary for its operation. In total, there are almost 10000 mag-

nets, of over 50 different types [110]. 1232 superconducting dipole magnets bend the beams, while 392 quadrupole

magnets focus the beams. The focusing is necessary to prevent the beams from diverging due to electromagnetic

interactions between the particles themselves. In addition to these so-called main dipole and main quadrupole

magnets, other magnets are used as well. These include higher order monopoles such as sextupole, octupole

and decapole magnets which correct for imperfections in the fields of the main dipoles and quadrupoles. Also, at

each experiment, two sets of triplets of quadrupoles are put in place (one set on each side). Their function is to

squeeze the beams before they collide, narrowing the beam diameter to 16 micrometers [111]. This allows for a

higher instantaneous luminosity.

   The charged particles are accelerated in radiofrequency (RF) cavities. These contain oscillating electric fields

at a frequency such that during the accelerating phase the charged particles always feel an accelerating force. The

RF cavities contain an electric field that oscillates with a frequency of 400 MHz, while the revolution frequency of the

LHC is 11.245 kHz. In order to ensure that a particle always feels an accelerating force when passing through the

RF cavity, the RF frequency must be a multiple of the revolution frequency. Particles that travel synchronized with

the RF frequency will feel the same force every time. This is referred to as a synchronous particle [112]. Particles

that deviate slightly from synchronization will tend to oscillate around the synchronous particles. This results in the

formation of groups of particles, which are referred to as bunches. The harmonic number h, defined by fRF = hfrev ,


                                                                           42


for the LHC is 35640. It represents the number of buckets in which a bunch can potentially be filled. However,

buckets are just virtual points on the ring, so they can be either filled with a bunch or be empty. In fact, the minimum

bunch spacing at the LHC is 25 ns (40 Mhz). Therefore, practically speaking there can be at most 3564 buckets

filled [113]. During the Pb–Pb data taking runs there were 518 (in 2015) and 733 (in 2018) bunches, each containing

around 2 · 108 Pb-ions per bunch [114].

    During operation, the bunches are not injected equidistantly, but following a certain filling scheme. The reason

for this is to create ideal collision settings for each of the four main experiments [113]. At IP1 and IP5, the ATLAS

and CMS experiment are located, which are high luminosity experiments. Therefore the goal is to deliver the

maximum luminosity at IP1 and IP5. However, the specialized experiments at IP2 (ALICE) and IP8 (LHCb), require

an optimum luminosity, with respect to how fast the detectors can process events. An example of a filling scheme

is 25ns_1740b_1728_1570_1636_96bpi_21inj. Here, the 25 ns refers to the bunch spacing. Values of 50 ns, 75 ns,

100 ns, or 525 ns for example are also possible. The second term refers to the total number of bunches present,

which is 1740 in this case. The following three numbers are the expected number of colliding bunch pairs at IP1/5,

IP2 and IP8 respectively. After that, a suffix can be added to encode information about a specific scheme. In this

case, the last two terms indicate that there were 96 bunches per injection for 21 injections [115].




2.2      ALICE Detector

In this section, the ALICE detector is outlined. The information mainly comes from Refs. [116–120], and an inter-

ested reader is invited to read these and references therein for additional or more detailed information.

    ALICE is a dedicated heavy-ion detector with a focus on QCD, which is the strong sector of the Standard Model.

The apparatus, with dimensions 16 × 16 × 26 m3 and weight of approximately 10000 t is shown in Fig. 2.2. It is able

to detect a wide variety of particles such as hadrons, electrons, muons and photons. It was specifically designed to

comprehensively study nuclear collisions in both hard scatterings at high energy scales and collective phenomena

at low energy scales. To this end, its design was specialized to have high granularity to cope with the large flux of

charged particles (up to 8000 per unit of rapidity at mid-rapidity2 ) as well as having tracking down to low momenta,

starting at ∼ 80 MeV/c [117]. Particle identification can also be provided for tracks with transverse momenta up to

20 GeV/c.

    The ALICE detector (Fig. 2.2) consists of many subdetectors which can be divided into three categories. First

is the central barrel, containing the Inner Tracking System (ITS), Time-Projection Chamber (TPC), Time-Of-Flight

(TOF) detector, Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), High-Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID), Pho-

ton Spectrometer (PHOS) and Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCAL). The entire central barrel is embedded in a
    2 Original estimates of charged particle multiplicity at LHC energies spanned a range of 2000 up to 8000. The detector was therefore designed

for a charged particle density at mid-rapidity of 4000 and tested in simulations at values twice as high [116] . However, in practice a maximum
density of about 2000 charged particles at mid-rapidity is reached in the most central Pb–Pb collisions [121].

solenoid (also known as the L3 magnet3 ) with a maximum field strength of B = 0.5 T. The main use of the central

barrel is to measure and identify charged hadrons, photons and electrons. More specifically, the ITS, TPC and TRD

reconstruct charged particle tracks. At low pT , the ITS, TPC and TOF are used for particle identification, while at

high pT the HMPID and TRD are also available. The EMCAL and PHOS are used for the measurement of photons

and electrons. For electrons, identification and measurement are also done with the ITS and TPC.

    Secondly there are the global detectors. These are the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC), Photon Multiplicity De-

tector (PMD), Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD), V0 detector and T0 detector. Although some of these detectors

are physically located in the central barrel, they serve a different purpose than to reconstruct particle tracks. Instead,

they are used for triggering, background rejection and global event characterization such as centrality. Moreover,

the T0 provides timing information necessary for the particle identification of the TOF. Lastly, located on top of the

central barrel is the ALICE Cosmic Ray Detector (ACORDE), for the detection of atmospheric muon events. The

ACORDE also is used for the alignment and calibration of some of the central barrel detectors.

    Lastly, there is the Muon Spectrometer at forward rapidity. As the name implies, its main function is to detect

muons. As it is the main detector used in this thesis, it will be outlined in more detail in subsection 2.2.3.

    Coordinate system
   3 L3 was one of four detectors in the Large Electron-Positron collider (LEP), which was the predecessor to the LHC. The magnet from the

dismantled L3 experiment was taken over by ALICE.


                                                                     44


The ALICE Coordinate System is defined as follows [122]: with the nominal interaction point of the collisions at

the origin, a Cartesian coordinate system is defined. The z-axis is parallel to the beam axis and the convention is

such that the Muon Spectrometer lies at negative z. The x-axis is perpendicular to the beam (and therefore z-axis),

pointing towards the center of the LHC where x-values are positive. Lastly, the y-axis is perpendicular to both the

x-axis and z-axis, pointing upwards for positive values. In spherical coordinates, ϕ denotes the azimuthal angle,

from 0 to 2π. The convention is such that it is 0 when it coincides with the positive x-axis, increasing to π/2 when it

coincides with the positive y-axis. The polar angle θ ranges from 0 when it coincides with the positive z-axis, to π/2

for the positive y-axis, to π for the negative z-axis.

    The main detector in the analyses described in this thesis is the muon spectrometer, but the V0 and SPD

detectors were used for the event selection. A brief description will be now given of both detectors, followed by the

description of the spectrometer.



2.2.1     V0 Detector

The V0 consists of two subdetectors, the V0A and V0C, which are located on opposite sides of the nominal in-

teraction point (see Fig. 2.2). The V0C is fixed to the front absorber of the Muon Spectrometer, at z = −88 cm,

covering a pseudorapidity range of −3.7 < η < −1.7. On the other side of the interaction point at z = 329 cm

is the V0A, covering 2.8 < η < 5.1. Both detectors are segmented in 4 rings in the radial direction, around the

beam pipe. Furthermore, each ring is further segmented into 8 sections in the azimuthal direction, covering the full

azimuth, as seen in Fig. 2.3. They are equipped with scintillator counters, and their working principle is as follows:

when charged particles pass through the scintillators, they lose energy by exciting the scintillator molecules. These

molecules then de-excite by emitting photons, which are subsequently guided in optical fibers before being collected

in Photo Multiplier Tubes. In these tubes, the photons are converted into an electric signal that is read out.

    The V0 has several important functions in the ALICE detector:

    • It provides the minimum bias triggers, by requiring a signal in both the V0A as well as the V0C4 .

    • The V0 also provides a rejection of beam-induced background events. This rejection is explained in detail

       in 3.1.1.1.

    • Based on the energy deposited in the V0, the charged particle multiplicity in the forward direction can be

       estimated. As this quantity is related to the event geometry, the V0 can consequently be used as a centrality

       estimator.

    • The V0 also provides a measurement of luminosity which is an essential element for cross section measure-

       ments.

  4 During early operation, other MB triggers were used for analyses. One such trigger is defined by a signal in either the V0A OR V0C. Another

obsolete trigger is the requirement of a signal in the V0A, V0C or SPD.

2.2.2    Silicon Pixel Detector

The Inner Tracking System is a set of concentric cylindrical detectors surrounding the beam pipe around the IP, as

shown in the upper right corner of Fig. 2.2. It has several tasks related to the operation of the central barrel, one of

which relates to the muon spectrometer: the ITS is used for the determination of the primary collision vertex, with

a resolution of better than 100 µm [116]. To do this, the innermost two layers of the ITS, called the Silicon Pixel

Detector (SPD), are used. The SPD consists of two cylinders of radius 3.9 and 7.6 cm, both 14.1 cm long. A total

of 9.84 million detection cells can be found on the SPD. This high number of cells is necessary, because at such

short distances to the IP, track densities can reach values of up to 50 tracks/ cm2 . The high granularity, coupled with

the small distance to the IP allows for the determination of the primary interaction vertex, to which tracks from the

spectrometer are extrapolated.



2.2.3    Muon Spectrometer

The Muon Spectrometer is the ALICE subsystem that is fully dedicated to muon detection. The muons can originate

from decays of light (ω and φ) or heavy (J/ψ and Υ families) vector mesons, open heavy flavors (such as D-mesons)

or the electroweak vector bosons W± and Z. The spectrometer covers the pseudorapidity region −4 < η < −2.5 and

is equipped with a high-granularity tracking system in order to cope with the large expected particle multiplicities in

Pb–Pb collisions. One of the important features of the detector is its quarkonium pT coverage, which goes down to

pTquarkonium = 0 GeV/c. This is important because some medium effects, such as heavy quark potential screening or

charm recombination, manifest more clearly at low pT [123].

   The spectrometer was designed to have a mass resolution of 100 MeV/c2 at the mass of the Υ (∼10 GeV/c2 ).

This is necessary to be able to distinguish the Υ, Υ0 and Υ00 resonances. It is this last requirement that determined

the bending strength of the spectrometer magnet as well as the spatial resolution of the tracking system. In practice,

this specification is reached at the J/ψ mass peak, with a resolution of ∼73 MeV/c2 in central Pb–Pb collisions.


                                                          46


However, at the Υ mass peak the resolution is 147 ± 27 MeV/c2 in minimum bias Pb–Pb collisions, exceeding the

design specification [117].

    A cross section of the spectrometer is shown in Fig. 2.4, in which the various components of the spectrometer

can be seen. A description of these components is given in the following.

well as the absorbers and the dipole magnet. Figure taken from Ref. [124].




2.2.3.1    Absorbers

Several passive absorbers are placed at various locations in the spectrometer. The front absorber is located between

the IP and the tracking chambers. It is a cone placed in the central barrel, mainly made of carbon, concrete and

steel. The absorber is 4.13 m long, representing ∼10 interaction lengths λint as well as ∼60 radiation lengths X0 5 .

The passive front absorber has two main purposes: to attenuate the flux of charged hadrons by two orders of

magnitude and to reduce background from muons that decay from pions and kaons [118]. By placing the absorber

as close to the IP as possible (geometrical constraints do not allow closer than 90 cm, to minimally interfere with the

functioning of the central barrel detectors), the pions and kaons can be absorbed before they decay. This reduces

the rate at which their muonic decay products enter the spectrometer.

    Along the length of the beam pipe, another absorber is placed, made of tungsten, lead and stainless steel. This

absorber is called the beam shield. Its main function is like that of the front absorber, to protect the tracking and
   5 The hadronic interaction length is a measure for the attenuation power of a material. It represents the mean distance over which a flux

reduces by a factor of 1/e. The radiation length is the mean distance over which an electron’s energy is reduced through radiation by a factor of
1/e. The radiation length influences the effect of multiple scattering. For accurate track reconstruction, multiple scattering should be mimimised.


                                                                       47


trigger chambers. It suppresses showers produced in the beam pipe, originating from primary particles. The design

of the beam shield is such that it also suppresses showers which may arise due to interactions with the beam shield

itself. The two aforementioned absorbers are however still not enough to protect the trigger chambers. For this

reason, an iron wall is placed between the last tracking station and the trigger system. The iron wall is 1.2 m thick

(with an area of 5.6 × 5.6 m2 ), which corresponds to ∼7.2 λint . Due to the additional number of hadronic interaction

lengths, the iron wall essentially acts as a muon filter that only lets through muons with a total momentum of at least

4 GeV/c.

   Lastly, there is a rear absorber behind the trigger stations to protect the spectrometer from particles coming from

beam-gas collisions.




2.2.3.2    Tracking system


The tracking is done with 5 tracking stations. Each tracking station is equipped with two cathode pad chamber

planes, which are placed both in front and in the back of the station. This results in a total of 10 detection planes.

Every chamber plane provides a different (x, y, z) coordinate for the track reconstruction. The stations are numbered

1 through 5, with station 1 being closest to the IP. Station 1 is placed right after the front absorber to measure the

exit point of the muons as accurately as possible. A dipole magnet (see subsection 2.2.3.3) is used to curve the

muons which is necessary for the determination of their momentum. Stations 1 and 2 are located in front of the

dipole, station 3 is inside of the dipole while stations 4 and 5 are located behind the dipole, as seen in Fig. 2.4.

   In order to keep the occupancy below 5% (one of the design specifications), the readout of the chambers is

highly segmented. The smallest pads used in the chambers are as small as 4.2 × 6.3 mm2 in station 1. The farther

away from the IP, the hit density decreases so the size of the readout pads increases to at most 5 × 100 mm2 in

station 3, 4 and 5.

   The acceptance of the detector is such that it can detect muons in a cone with an opening angle between 2◦ and

9◦ . The active area of stations 1 and 2 are the geometrical projections of this cone [119], as shown by the diagonal

lines in Fig. 2.4. A so-called quadrant structure is used for the tracking chambers of these stations, see Fig. 2.5-left.

This means that the active area was divided into four sections of equal size, called quadrants. Stations 3, 4 and 5

need to cover larger surface area as they are further from the IP. However, creating large quadrants is mechanically

very challenging. Therefore, these three stations use a so-called slat geometry, where horizontal elements (slats)

are mosaically placed in two half-chambers, see Fig. 2.5-right. The semi-modular design allows for more reliable

equipment, and reduces the overall cost and manpower requirements [119]. The design of the tracking system

allows for a spatial resolution of 70 µm in the bending plane (vertically).

2.2.3.3   Dipole magnet


The curvature of particles in a magnetic field allows one to measure their momenta and charge. In the spectrometer,

a warm (i.e. not superconducting) dipole magnet is used, in which the third tracking station is placed. The dipole

magnet, shown in Fig. 2.6, is 5 m long and weighs about 850 tons. It delivers a nominal field strength of 0.7 T and

an integrated field strength of 3 Tm. The magnetic field is oriented along the x-axis, perpendicular to the beam and

along the LHC radius. Therefore the dipole bends muons in the vertical y direction also perpendicular to the beam.

Consequently, the xz-plane and yz-plane are known as the non-bending plane and the bending plane, respectively.

The field polarity of the magnet can be inverted as well, with the magnetic flux either oriented along the positive

x-axis or opposite to it.

2.2.3.4   Trigger system

The trigger system consists of two trigger stations. Each trigger stations is equipped with two detection planes: one

in front and one in the back, totaling 4 detection planes. Each plane consists of 18 resistive plate chamber modules

and has a surface area of 6 × 6 m2 . Due to the fact that muons that reach the trigger must pass through both the

front absorber as well as the iron wall, there is a minimum detection threshold on the total momentum of p = 4

GeV/c. There is a significant flux of muons from pion and kaon decays, which are not interesting for most analyses.

However, they are mainly present at low pT (see Fig. 2.9 in Ref. [126]). In order to avoid triggering on these muons,

a pT threshold is applied to the triggering of the individual muon tracks. Two programmable values (low-pT and

high-pT ) can be used, ranging from ∼0.5 to ∼2 GeV/c. The exact configuration depends on the collision system and

interaction rate, and can therefore change between different data-taking periods. The trigger system can supply

triggers for either single muon tracks (relevant for open heavy flavor or W± decays) or for muon pairs (relevant for

resonances).

Z boson: analysis method

The objectives of the analysis are to quantify Z-boson production in Pb–Pb collisions and to compare it to the

production in proton–proton (pp) collisions. The production will be expressed as the invariant yield normalized by

the average nuclear overlap function, which is defined as

                                             hTAA i   A · NMB · hTAA i · ∆y

NZ is the number of Z bosons and A is the acceptance and efficiency of the detector, which corrects for detector

accceptance and finite reconstruction and selection efficiency. Strictly speaking, in this analysis the acceptance of

the detector is not corrected for, as the yield is given for a specific rapidity interval. Despite this, in literature the term

’acceptance and efficiency’ is commonly found, and the same terminology will be adopted in this thesis. NMB is

the number of minimum bias (MB) events corresponding to the number of analysed triggered events. Minimum bias

refers to the least stringent trigger definition such that the largest fraction of all inelastic collisions are accepted (a

more detailed description is given in subsection 3.1.1). The hTAA i represents the average nuclear overlap function

and its function is to normalize the Pb–Pb yield to a yield per nucleon–nucleon collision. This allows one to directly

compare the yield in Pb–Pb collisions with the production cross section in pp collisions. The last term in the equation

is ∆y, which is the rapidity interval considered.

   Additionally, the nuclear modification factor RAA will be shown. Related to the invariant yield, it is calculated as


                                                      NZ                dN/dy ∆y
                                     RAA =                            =       ·    ,                                     (3.2)

where σpp is the Z-boson cross section in proton–proton collisions. The nuclear modification factor quantifies the

degree to which a Pb–Pb collision can be considered as a linear superposition of pp collisions. A deviation of unity

indicates that effects are present in Pb–Pb collisions which are absent in pp collisions.

separate sections each dedicated to the explanation of the terms of Eq. 3.1 and 3.2. The sections appear in the

same order as the symbols in the two equations. The last section of this chapter details the systematic uncertainties

of the analysis.




3.1     Data sample

The data analysed in this thesis were collected with the ALICE detector and pertain to Pb–Pb collisions at a center-
                                      √
of-mass energy per nucleon pair of sNN = 5.02 TeV. They were taken in three distinct periods. Periods are

generally several weeks long, and consist of runs. A run is an uninterrupted data taking time interval, which can last

from a few minutes up to a few hours. Once a run is stopped, the data is transmitted for storage and another run is

started. Runs can be stopped for several reasons but the most frequent one is a malfunctioning subdetector. Due

to the relatively short timescales of runs, within one run detector and beam conditions can be considered constant.

As an aside, the runs discussed here are not to be confused with LHC Runs (with capital R) which last several

years and are typically marked by large-scale changes in the detectors and the accelerator itself. In ALICE, each

data taking period is appointed a name that consists of the year followed by a letter, starting with a, while runs are

identified by a unique run number. To specify, the data analysed are those of the 15o, 18q and 18r periods. The 15o

period lasted from Nov 24th - Dec 13th 2015, while 18q and 18r lasted from Nov 3rd - 21st and Nov 22nd - Dec 3rd

2018 respectively. Between the 18q and 18r periods, the polarity of the dipole magnet in the muon spectrometer

was reversed.



3.1.1    Event selection

In ALICE, various subdetectors are used in the trigger system. A signal from a trigger detector is referred to as

a trigger input. Combinations of trigger inputs then define trigger classes that are used to label events. As an

important example, the minimum bias (MB) trigger class is defined by the coincidence of an input from both the V0A

and V0C detectors. This MB trigger is called the CINT7 trigger class. Here, CINT stands for Collision INTeraction,

while 7 refers to the configuration of a coincidence of the V0A and V0C detectors. Initially, other MB triggers with

different numbers were also in use. For example, the CINT1 trigger consists of a signal in either the V0A, V0C or

SPD. However, as luminosities increased during early LHC operation, the CINT7 trigger class was found to have

higher purity than the others [117]. It was consequently adopted as the standard for MB collisions.

   Detectors other than the V0 may also provide trigger inputs. The muon spectrometer is equipped with its own

trigger system for this very reason. It was designed to be able to provide several trigger inputs, suiting the needs of

various types of muon analyses. The unlike-sign dimuon trigger input is fired when two muons of opposite charge

pass trough the muon trigger chambers with the additional requirement that each muon has a transverse momentum


                                                          52


above a certain low-pT threshold. This threshold is configurable, but was set to pµT & 1 GeV/c for the Pb–Pb data

taking periods. The combination of simultaneous V0A and V0C inputs (the requirement for MB events) along with

the unlike-sign dimuon input defines the CMUL7 trigger class. Here, the M indicates a muon event, U an unlike sign

pair and L the low-pT trigger threshold (other trigger classes use a high-pT threshold of ∼4.2 GeV/c). In addition to

the muon pair triggers, trigger classes for single muons are also defined. The CMSL7 (CMSH7) class is defined by

the presence of a single muon above the low-pT (high-pT ) threshold in coincidence with the MB requirement.

   Because the Z bosons decay into a pair of opposite-sign muons, the analysis was done on CMUL7 events. They

were required to have a centrality between 0 and 90%. The centrality was estimated using the V0 detector, and

a detailed outline of the framework is provided in subsection 3.6.5. In the 90-100% interval, contamination from

electromagnetic interactions becomes considerable so these events were not considered for analysis. However,

even in the 0-90% interval, other types of background events contaminate in the dataset. These background events

are rejected using criteria that are called the physics selection and are detailed in the following.


3.1.1.1   Physics selection

The physics selection applied on the data comprises two criteria.

   The first criterium is to reject beam-background events. These events can be either beam-gas interactions (due

to the fact that the beam pipe does not contain a perfect vacuum) or interactions between the beam halo and

accelerator components. They can be distinguished using the timing information of the V0A and V0C signals, see

Fig. 3.1. The baseline for the collision time is always given by the LHC clock, which gives the reference time for a

bunch crossing. For collisions at the IP, the signal arrives in the V0A (V0C) after ∼11(3) ns, which leads to the main

peak visible in the plot. Beam-background events from the A (C) side however, will cause a negative arrival time of

-11(-3) ns, leading to the two smaller peaks. By making selections on the arrival time information of the V0A and

V0C, such background contributions can be greatly reduced.

   The second criterium is a selection on the collision timing of beam-beam events, such that the collisions occur

at specific intervals. In the LHC, buckets are spaced 2.5 ns apart, while bunches (i.e. filled buckets) are separated

by multiples of 25 ns. This means that at most 1 out of every 10 buckets is filled with a bunch. These are called

main bunches. However, particles can drift into an adjacent bucket, which is then named a satellite bunch. Satellite

bunches can collide as well, giving rise to main-satellite and satellite-satellite collisions. These types of collisions are

called parasitic collisions, and can be rejected using timing information of the ZDC detectors. Namely, the signals

in the ZDC originating from parasitic collisions are displaced by multiples of 2.5 ns, as seen in Fig. 3.1. Similarly to

the usage of the V0 detectors, selections in the arrival time can be used to reject these unwanted parasitic events.

   After the physics selection, 127, 110 and 163 million CMUL7 events remain in the 15o, 18q and 18r periods,

respectively. Online measurements were done for the integrated luminosity of the data sets. For 15o, the integrated

luminosity is roughly 225µb−1 , while the 18q and 18r periods amount to an integrated luminosity of 525µb−1 together.

3.1.2    Track reconstruction and selection

As muons traverse the spectrometer, they interact with it to produce hits in the tracking and trigger chambers. From

the hits in the 5 tracking stations (10 tracking chambers), a muon chamber track is reconstructed. This is done only

if there is at least 1 hit in each of the first three stations and 3 in the last two stations. The reconstruction then occurs

in two stages.

   In the first stage, the reconstruction starts at the station 4 or 5, depending on which station contains two hits. A

track segment is made from the two hits, and extrapolated to the other station (5 or 4). The track segment is further

extrapolated to stations 3, 2 and 1 to obtain a muon chamber track. From the muon chamber track, the exit point

of the track at the front absorber is calculated. The polar angle of this exit point is called θabs , as seen in Fig. 3.2.

In the second stage, the muon chamber track is extrapolated to the vertex through the absorber. The z coordinate

of the interaction vertex, determined with the SPD detector, is used for this. The muon chamber track is forced to

point to the interaction vertex and additionally, the vertex information is used to apply physical corrections due to

energy loss and multiple scattering effects. After these corrections, the muon tracks (as opposed to muon chamber

tracks) are considered reconstructed and track parameters such as pseudorapidity and transverse momentum are

determined.

   Hits are also produced in the trigger chambers. These are not directly used in the track reconstruction, although

the reconstruction would not improve much due to the low resolution of the trigger chambers. Instead, by requiring

that a reconstructed muon track can be matched to a track segment in the trigger stations, background tracks can

be rejected. This is discussed in more detail in the next paragraph. After the matching is performed, the tracks are

considered matched muon tracks.


                                                                                 54


   The tracking algorithm reconstructs a large number of tracks, but not all of these are useful for analysis. For

example, some tracks can originate from hadrons that make it through the front absorber or from muons that undergo

significant scattering in parts of the absorber. In order to improve the quality and purity of the data sample, the

following criteria were applied on the reconstructed tracks:


   - −4 < ηµ < −2.5. This interval matches the geometrical acceptance of the muon spectrometer.



   - 170◦ < θabs < 178◦ . Outside of this interval, the absorber consists of high-Z material, see Fig. 3.2. Below 170◦ ,

     Pb and polyethylene is used to protect the chambers from tracks that escape the beam, while at 178◦ < θ <

     180◦ the beam shield made of Pb and Tungsten is located (missing in Fig. 3.2 but shown in Fig. 2.4). Tracks

     that traverse these high-Z regions of the absorber undergo significant multiple scattering. This complicates the

     energy loss and scattering corrections and these tracks are therefore rejected. This criterium is different than

     the one above as the pseudorapidity at the vertex relates to the entrance point at the front absorber, while θabs

     relates to the exit point. The combination of both selections ensures that the geometrical acceptance of the

     detector is respected while not traversing the high-Z region of the front absorber and beam pipe.



   - pµ × DCA < 6σ, where pµ is the muon momentum and DCA (Distance of Closest Approach) is its closest

     distance to the primary vertex, as shown in Fig. 3.2. To obtain the DCA, the muon chamber tracks are extrap-

     olated to the z component of the primary vertex. A 2-dimensional DCA (in the xy plane) can subsequently

     be determined. Due to multiple scattering in the front absorber, the DCA distribution of particles produced

     in a collision is Gaussian with a width that depends on the amount of material crossed and is proportional

     to 1/pµ . On the other hand, background tracks (from beam–gas interactions) have a DCA of around 40 cm,

     independent of pµ [92]. The measured DCA distribution is therefore fitted with a Gaussian function whose

     width is used in the product with the momentum of a track to reject background tracks.



   - Only muon tracks that can be matched to track segments in the trigger stations were considered. This criterium

     reduces the low-pT muon background from pions and kaons that do not reach the trigger chambers due to the

     iron wall placed in front of it.



   - pT ≥ 20 GeV/c. Due to the high mass of the Z boson, its decay muons will have a large transverse momentum.

     As will be explained in the following subsection, the signal extraction is performed in the 60-120GeV/c2 mass

     interval, so pairs of low-pT muons will not contribute to it.


   The cumulative effect these criteria have on the number of (di)muons is shown in Tab. 3.1.

3.2      Signal extraction NZ


An invariant mass spectrum is computed from all possible opposite-sign muon pairs per event. An additional selec-

tion, on the rapidity1 of the dimuon pair, is applied: 2.5 < y µµ < 4.0. The number of Z-boson candidates is then

obtained by counting the number of dimuons in the 60–120 GeV/c2 mass interval. This is roughly symmetric around

the PDG mass of the Z-boson of 91.1876 ± 0.0021 GeV/c2 [127]. The invariant mass spectrum is shown in Fig. 3.3.

The spectrum is compared to one obtained from simulations (which are discussed in detail in section 3.3.1). The

simulated spectrum was scaled to match the number of candidates in the 60-120 GeV/c2 interval, and shows good

agreement with the data. A slight shift in the simulated distribution is present and the effect of this is discussed later,

in subsection 3.6.9.



   1 In the ALICE convention, the spectrometer lies at negative z, and therefore at negative (pseudo)rapidity. Due to the symmetric nature of the

collisions however, the rapidity of the Z (dimuon) is given in positive values.


                                                                      56


3.2.1    Combinatorial background

In addition to decays from Z bosons, opposite-sign muon pairs can also originate from uncorrelated muons. This

can happen for instance when several pairs of muons are produced in jets. This combinatorial background from

uncorrelated pairs is estimated in the analysis as follows. For muons in the kinematic regime defined by the analysis,

the occurrence of same-sign pairs should be of similar magnitude as for unlike-sign pairs. Therefore, the invariant

mass distribution for same-sign pairs is also computed. The CMUL7 events, on which the analysis is performed,

cannot be used for this, as these events do not trigger on pairs of like-sign muons. Instead, single muon triggered

CMSH7 events were used. Using these CMSH7 events, the invariant mass spectrum was computed for like-sign

pairs. There is one like-sign pair present in the fiducial region, represented by the red square in Fig. 3.3. This pair

was subtracted from the signal extraction to reduce the number of candidates by one. As a check, the unlike-sign

pair invariant mass spectrum was also computed from the CMSH7 events and the same spectrum was found as

when analysing the CMUL7 events.

3.2.2    Signal extraction results

Table 3.2 shows the number of candidates NZ for each period as well as for the full dataset, which comprises the

15o, 18q and 18r periods. In the table, the aforementioned like-sign signal has already been subtracted. The full

fiducial region consists of the muon pairs of muons with pT > 20 GeV/c and −4 < ηµ < −2.5, and dimuons with

rapidity 2.5 < yµµ < 4. The signal extraction is also shown as a function of centrality and rapidity. For this, several

different bin intervals were considered. In the end, the bins were chosen such that each bin has a relative statistical

uncertainty of less than 20%. A Poisson distribution is assumed for the number of candidates, meaning that the

3.3     Acceptance and Efficiency A

3.3.1    Simulation setup

Muon tracks are reconstructed from hits in the detector chambers. These hits arise from interactions between

the muons and the detector. However, due to finite detector resolution differences may be present between track

parameters and the muon properties such as transverse momentum. This consequently affects the reconstruction

of the Z bosons. In order to obtain the produced yield from the detected yield, the efficiency of the detector must be

accounted for, denoted by the symbol A. The A was evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which include

both the Z → µµ and γ ∗ → µµ processes.

   The simulations consist of a three-step procedure. First, an event generator calculates matrix elements and

cross sections of desired processes. Primary particles and their decay products are then created following the cross

section distributions. Some event generators also include initial and final state radiations, and subsequent parton

showers. Secondly, the particles are passed to a transport code (GEANT3 [128]) which simulates the propagation

of the particles through the detector as well as their interactions with the detector. These interactions then create

hits in detection elements. Thirdly, a reconstruction algorithm uses the hits as input to reconstruct particle tracks

that are used for analysis. During data taking, only the third step can be done.

   In the MC simulations, Z bosons and virtual photons were set to decay to two muons, each with a pT > 15

GeV/c. Two separate sets of MC productions were used in the evaluation of the A. The two sets differ in the event

generator employed.

   • One set was produced using PYTHIA 8 which is an event generator at leading order (LO) [129]. In Pb–Pb

      collisions, the A depends on the detector occupancy and therefore on the event centrality. Unfortunately,

      simulations generally do not properly reproduce multiplicities in Pb–Pb collisions. Therefore, an embedding

      technique was used, which will be explained now. Z bosons, decaying into muon pairs, were simulated from


                                                            58


     pp collisions and steps 1 and 2 of the procedure above were followed. At this point, the hit information from the

     muon interactions with the detector is obtained. This information is then added to the raw data (i.e. hits) from

     measured Pb–Pb events. Finally, the reconstruction algorithm was reran on embedded event, which contains

     both the measured and simulated hits. Because the embedding essentially adds a simulated event into a

     measured event, this ensures that multiplicities are realistic. This way, the centrality dependence of the A

     can be properly taken into account. In the remainder of the text, this set will be referred to as the embedded

     simulations.


   • On the other hand, a set using POWHEG as event generator was also used [130]. POWHEG can generate

     events at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. Because POWHEG only produces the events, it was inter-

     faced with PYTHIA 6 [131] which handles initial/final state radiation and decay kinematics. As was the case for

     the embedding, the Z bosons were created from simulated pp collisions. In contrast, no embedding technique

     was done with this set. For brevity, this set will be referred to as the POWHEG simulation, although it also

     includes PYTHIA 6.

Ideally, the embedding would have been done with POWHEG as event generator instead of PYTHIA8. This would

combine the higher order calculations in POWHEG together with the centrality dependence of the embedding in a

single set of simulations. However, the embedding technique is computationally intensive. Therefore, in order to

prevent various analysers from each creating their own embedding, one multi-purpose embedding simulation was

created by a senior member of ALICE. This embedding contains electroweak bosons and also several quarkonia.

For the Z bosons, the standard generator in PYTHIA was used. On the other hand, the POWHEG simulations

were created privately by the Z-boson analysers and only for Z bosons. Due to a lack of computing resources, the

POWHEG events were not embedded. In the end, both sets of simulations were combined, as will be explained in

subsections 3.3.4 and 3.3.5.



3.3.2   Calculation of A

In the simulations one has access to kinematic variables of all particles at both generated and reconstructed levels.

The procedure for the signal extraction explained in section 3.2 was used to extract the number of reconstructed

dimuon pairs Nrec as well as the number of generated dimuon pairs Ngen , so that the A is calculated as


                                                           Nrec
                                                    A =        .                                                (3.3)
                                                           Ngen

For the reconstructed pairs it was checked that the decay muons originated from a Z boson. As a technical remark,

Ngen refers to the number of generated dimuon pairs that obey the selection criteria and not directly the number of

generated Z bosons. Due to final state radiation, differences in (transverse) momentum of the muons may arise. This


                                                         59


subsequently influences the invariant mass of the dimuons. Because the A is computed specifically for dimuons in

the 60-120 GeV/c2 interval, this can influence the value of the A. In the data, the muons that are measured in the

detector have already undergone final state radiations. For consistency, the reconstructed dimuon pairs (therefore

including radiation) were used for the calculations.


3.3.3          Run dependence of A

Detector conditions can vary in time, for example due to different bunch filling schemes or random subdetector

malfunctions. As a consequence, the A will vary as well. In order to take this time dependence into account, the A

is calculated on a run-by-run basis. Figure 3.4 shows the A obtained from the POWHEG simulation as a function

of the run number for the 18q and 18r periods. The A is relatively stable, with the exception of some runs that show

a lower A. This behavior originate from temporary issues such as high-voltage trips in the tracking chambers.

3.3.4          Centrality dependence of A

Figure 3.4 shows the run-by-run values of the A for the 18q and 18r periods, as computed with the POWHEG

simulation. The POWHEG events were not embedded in Pb–Pb events and therefore by default contain no centrality

dependence. In central Pb–Pb collisions, the number of produced particles is very high, which subsequently leads


                                                              60


to a high detector occupancy. The high occupancy negatively impacts the trigger efficiency. The tracking efficiency

is also affected, but to a lesser degree due to the higher granularity (1.08 · 106 readout channels in the tracking

chambers versus 2.1 · 104 in the trigger chambers [116]). To take the centrality dependence of the A into account,

the embedded simulations were used. Figure 3.5 shows the centrality dependence of the A for the 15o, 18q and

18r data taking periods. In peripheral collisions, the A is stable and the value is relatively constant. Towards central

collisions, the occupancy increases and the A decreases, as expected. In general, the A in 15o is higher than

in the 18q and 18r periods. This can be attributed to detector deterioration as well as an increased frequency of

detector issues due to higher beam intensities during the 2018 data taking. Namely, the higher beam intensity

results in higher activity in the detector, which can lead to high-voltage trips in the detector elements. In 15o (18q

and r), the A at the plateau is about 76% (71%), decreasing to 71% (65%) in the most central collisions. Comparing

with the POWHEG simulations, A is higher than the embedded simulations in the 15o period, while it is lower in

the 18q and 18r periods.

Z bosons. In real CMUL7 events however, the distribution of Z bosons is skewed towards central events. Similarly

to the case of the run-by-run averaging explained earlier, an arithmetic average of the centrality intervals would be

biased because the centrality distribution of Z bosons would be neglected. In order to obtain the proper value of the

A for different centrality intervals, the A was first calculated in 10% wide bins, as can be seen in Fig. 3.5. After

this, a weighted average was computed. Ideally, the measured number of Z-boson candidates per centrality interval

would be used for such an averaging, because such a quantity naturally reflects the proper centrality distribution

of Z bosons. However, the low number of candidates does not allow for such a weighting, due to large statistical

uncertainties in the more peripheral centrality intervals. Instead, the average number of binary collisions hNcoll i

per centrality bin was used. Because the Z bosons are exclusively produced in the initial hard scatterings, their

production is directly proportional to the number of binary collisions [132]. Therefore, hNcoll i can be used as a

substitute for the weights. The values of hNcoll i were obtained from MC Glauber simulations [133], and are shown

in Tab. 3.6. As an example, the A for the 0–90% centrality bin was calculated as

   In pp collisions, similar multiplicities are reached as in peripheral Pb–Pb collisons. Therefore, the A value of the

POWHEG simulation should be equal to that of the embedded simulations in peripheral events. The A value per

centrality interval was then calculated as

where the subscript c indicates the centrality bin. This method combines the higher accuracy of the POWHEG

simulations (NLO instead of LO) together with the centrality dependence of the embedding. Figure 3.5 shows

that there is a discrepancy between the A in the POWHEG simulations and in the 80 − 90% centrality bin in the

embedding simulations. The discrepancies, going from the POWHEG value to the value from the 80 − 90% centrality

bin in the embedding, are −0.6%, +1.2% and +0.6%, in the 15o, 18q and 18r period respectively. This challenges

the assumption that value of the A in the POWHEG simulation should be equal to that in the peripheral events

of the embedding, which was used in Eq. 3.6. In order to test the stability of the A, two methods were used to

compute the A over the full data set. The first method is the one using Eq. 3.6, combining the POWHEG values

with the centrality dependence given by the embedding. For the second method, the A was computed using only

the embedding simulation (without normalization to the POWHEG value). The difference in A between the two

methods was found to be < 0.5% with the exception of one the 3.25 < y < 4.00 rapidity bin in which it was 1%

(the rapidity dependence is detailed in the following subsection). In subsection 3.6.8, the systematic uncertainty of

the A is detailed. The uncertainty is estimated to be 5%, which covers the discrepancy observed between the two

rapidity dependent yield is integrated in centrality, so the same procedure was applied to the A. Namely, for a

specific rapidity interval ∆y, the A was first calculated on a run-by-run basis in 10% wide centrality bins. The

run-weighted average was then computed for each centrality bin. After this, the A was calculated for the 0-90%

centrality interval, using hNcoll i as weights. Lastly, the embedded simulations were combined with the POWHEG

simulations. To increase the statistical precision, the 70–90% interval was used for peripheral events instead of the

80–90% considered earlier, as the A already reaches its plateau starting at 70% centrality. The A as a function of

rapidity was then calculated as

3.3.6   Summary

The values of the detector acceptance and efficiency are shown in Tab. 3.3. They are shown both as a function of

centrality and rapidity. The A as a function of centrality is integrated over rapidity and vice versa. The obtained

values are computed specifically for muons that satisfy the track selection criteria outlined in section 3.1.2. For

these values, the weighted average of the three periods was computed, using the number of CMUL7 events in each

period as weight (see Eq. 3.4). This essentially treats the entire ensemble of runs as one large data taking period.

3.4     Number of minimum bias events NMB

One objective of the analysis is to compare the yield in Pb–Pb collisions with the theoretical cross section in pp

collisions. Although the latter can be calculated for a specific kinematic region (with selections on muon pT and

dimuon rapidity), it is not computed for specific triggers or detectors. Effectively, the theoretical cross section is

calculated for minimum bias events. However, the analysis is performed on CMUL7 events, which are events

containing at least one unlike-sign dimuon pair. Therefore, the number of CMUL7 events must be converted into an

equivalent number of minimum bias events. This conversion is given by the normalization factor, as



                                               NMB = Fnorm × NCMUL7 ,                                               (3.8)


where N denotes the number of events and Fnorm the normalization factor. It should be noted that there exist several

trigger classes for MB events. As is the case for the analysis, both the MB as well as CMUL7 events must pass the

physics and centrality selections described earlier.

   There are three different methods to obtain the normalization factor. Two of these use offline data, i.e. stored

events. However, not all triggered events are stored. This would be unfeasible due to storage limitations and

because the readout time for some detectors is too slow to allow this. Therefore, only a fraction of triggered events

is stored, a procedure referred to as downscaling. The third method makes use of the online trigger counters.

These count the number of instances that various trigger inputs were fired. Because the counting precedes any

event storage and therefore downscaling, the online method benefits from higher statistical precision.

   In the following, the three methods will be outlined, after which the description and choice of the MB triggers

is given. Then, the calculation of the normalization factor per run and period are outlined. Finally, the obtained

normalization factors are shown in a summary table.



3.4.1    Methods

The first method is called the offline direct method. For the calculation of the normalization factor, the trigger inputs

in all MB events that pass the physics selection in a run are inspected (see 3.1.1). The normalization factor is

obtained by


                                                                 i
                                                  i             NMB
                                                 Fnorm =    i
                                                                      ,                                             (3.9)
                                                           NMB&0MUL

where N denotes the number of a certain event per run i, and 0MUL the trigger input for an unlike-sign dimuon pair.

For example, the CINT7 trigger class is defined by the 0VBA && 0VBC trigger inputs, which represent a hit in the

V0A and V0C respectively. However, it can occur that the 0MUL input was also fired for a CINT7 event. Therefore,

this method essentially computes the inverse of the fraction of MB events that contains an unlike-sign muon pair.

   A second method, called the offline indirect method was also used. In this method, the CMSL7 and 0MSL were

used as intermediate trigger class and trigger input respectively. The reason for using the intermediate class is to

increase the statistical precision of the calculation. Namely, there should be a larger overlap between the 0MSL


                                                           64


input than 0MUL in MB events due to the less stringent criterium of only 1 muon present instead of an unlike-sign

pair. By the same reasoning, there should be a larger overlap between CMSL7 events and CMSL7 events where

the 0MUL input was fired. For the indirect method, the trigger inputs of all MB events that pass physics selection

and all CMSL7 events that pass physics selection were inspected. The normalization factor is then calculated as


                                                      i                i
                                         i           NMB              NCMSL7
                                        Fnorm =    i
                                                               ×    i
                                                                               .                                (3.10)

     Thirdly, it is also possible to use the online trigger counters. However, no physics selection is applied at the

counting stage, so they also contain background events such as from beam-gas interactions. Therefore, a correction

is applied to the counters, using the physics purity. This is defined as the fraction of events that pass the physics

and centrality selections, and is computed using offline data. For this method, the normalization factor is calculated

as

where L0b indicates the number of online trigger counts and P the physics purity for a run i.

     Regardless of the method used, the normalization factor must be corrected for pileup events. These arise when

multiple collisions occur within the time resolution of the detector. The reason for this pileup correction is that no

pileup events were rejected in the data sample. When determining the number of MB events however, they must be

taken into account in the normalisation factor. The values in Eqs. 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 are therefore multiplied by

run i and fLHC = 11245 Hz the revolution frequency of LHC. In Pb–Pb collisions, the interaction rate is much lower

than in pp and p–Pb collisions and the order of magnitude of the pileup correction is of the per mille level.



3.4.2     Choice for MB trigger

There are several triggers that can serve as MB triggers. Depending on the period and method, different MB triggers

were used for the calculation of the normalization factor. In this subsection, the choice of MB trigger for each method

is outlined.


                                                          65


   Both offline methods used the CINT7 trigger for the 15o period. In 2018 a related trigger was introduced, called

the CINT7ZAC trigger. This trigger class requires a 1ZAC input on top of the 0VBA && 0VBC inputs mentioned

earlier. The 1ZAC is defined as the coincidence of a signal in the ZNA and ZNC detectors, which are subdetectors

of the ZDC. Its purpose is to remove electromagnetic contributions, which are present mainly in peripheral events.

The CINT7ZAC trigger is also less downscaled than the CINT7, which yields a higher precision in the determination

of the normalization factor. Therefore, CINT7ZAC was used for the 18q and 18r data for both offline methods.

However, for the CINT7(ZAC) triggers, the normalization factor for the online method was found to be systematically

higher than for the offline methods. This behaviour had also been found in an earlier ALICE analysis and was

attributed to V0 afterpulses, which caused an overcounting of the CINT7(ZAC) triggers.

   For the online method, another MB trigger class, called C0V0M, was used. The C0V0M trigger fires when the

sum (instead of the logical AND, for CINT7) of the V0A and V0C surpasses a threshold. The threshold is set such

that the C0V0M does not cover the entire 0–90% centrality range, as can be seen in Fig. 3.6. The C0V0M is

therefore by design a semi-central, or high-multiplicity trigger. In the calculations involving C0V0M events, only the

most central 60% in 2015 and the most central 50% in 2018 were used. Subsequently, the normalization factor must

be rescaled to obtain a normalization factor in the 0–90% centrality range. Because there is no selection on the final

state in MB events, the centrality distribution should by definition be flat. In Fig. 3.6, it can be seen that this is indeed

the case. Therefore the normalization factor was rescaled by 9/6 in the 15o period and 9/5 in 18q and 18r. Because

there are less C0V0M events than CINT7(ZAC), C0V0M was not used as the MB trigger for the offline methods.

3.4.4    Centrality dependent normalization factor

The Z-boson production will be presented as a function of centrality. To obtain the number of MB events in a given

centrality range, one can either compute a centrality dependent normalization factor, or calculate the normalization

with respect to the full 0–90% centrality range and then rescale the number of events. The latter relies on the flatness

of the centrality distribution of MB events. This should by definition be flat because MB events are supposed to

represent collisions without specific selections on physics (such as the presence of a dimuon pair). To this end, the

number of MB events per centrality interval was calculated both with the normalization factor over the full centrality

range as well as centrality dependent. The values for both calculations are shown in Tab. 3.4. The two methods are

well in agreement with each other, so it was not found necessary to compute a normalization factor per centrality

interval. Therefore, in the end only one normalization factor is reported per period.

CMUL7 events, the number of equivalent MB events NMB can be obtained according to equation 3.8. To be precise,

the normalization factors shown were used to convert the number of CMUL7 events in the 0-90% interval to the

number of MB events in the 0-90% interval. The statistical uncertainties of the values were found to be negligible.

Instead, only the systematic uncertainties on the values are shown. The procedure to obtain the systematic un-

certainty is detailed in subsection 3.6.2. To determine the normalization factor for the full data set, the weighted

average of the three periods was calculated, using the total number of CMUL7 events per period as weight.

3.5     Nuclear overlap function hTAA i and proton–proton cross section σpp

In this section, the values of the average nuclear overlap function hTAA i and proton–proton cross section σpp used

in Eqs. 3.1 and 3.2 are given.




3.5.1    Nuclear overlap function

Per Pb–Pb collision, the Z-boson yield is higher than in a pp collision, simply because there are more colliding

nucleons. In order to make a fair comparison with the pp cross section, the yield in Pb–Pb must be normalized by

the number of binary collisions. This normalization is given by the hTAA i. The values of the hTAA i are calculated from

Glauber MC simulations, and were taken from Ref. [133]. For the bins unlisted in [133], an averaging over centrality

was calculated, using hNcoll i as weights. Due to correlations between the bins, the uncertainty was conservatively

estimated as the average of the uncertainties as well. The values of the hTAA i are shown in Tab. 3.6, along with

the systematic uncertainties which are detailed in subsection 3.6.3. The last column shows the average number of

participating nucleons, scaled by the average number of binary collisions. In heavy-ion collisions, the centrality of an

event can also be expressed by the average number of participants hNpart i. Participants are nucleons that undergo

at least one binary collision. However, because the Z bosons are created in hard scatterings, their production scales

with the number of binary collisions. By scaling hNpart i by hNcoll i, more central events are given larger weights to

reflect that the majority of binary collisions occur in these events. This hNcoll i-weighted average of hNpart i, shown

in the last column of Tab. 3.6 is therefore a better measure of the centrality.

3.5.2   Proton–proton cross section

One of the tools to quantify physical effects in particle production due to the Pb-nucleus environment is the RAA .

For the calculation of the RAA , the proton–proton cross section is needed. Ideally, a measurement of the Z-boson

production at the same center-of-mass energy would be used for this. Although data were collected from pp colli-
        √
sions at s = 5.02 TeV, the luminosity is not high enough to allow for the measurement of Z bosons. Additionally, no

measurements done by other experiments in the kinematic regime of the analysis (2.5 < y µµ < 4, pµT > 20 GeV/c)

exist. Instead, theoretical values were used, provided by H.Paukkunen [134]. The values of σpp were calculated

using NLO pQCD, and are shown in Tab. 3.7. The cross section was computed for the fiducial region detailed in

section 3.2, with the same selections as for the signal extraction. This means that the single muons were required

to have pµT > 20 GeV/c and −4 < η µ < −2.5 while for the dimuon pairs additional selections of 2.5 < yµµ < 4 and

60 < mµµ < 120 GeV/c2 were applied. The systematic uncertainties on the cross section, which will be detailed in

subsection 3.6.4, are also shown in the table.

The method used for the signal extraction is to count the number of dimuon entries in the 60–120 GeV/c2 mass

region. This relies on the assumption that this region contains only signal candidates. It is therefore important to

check and verify this assumption. In an earlier ALICE publication, also on Z-boson production in Pb–Pb collisions at
√
  sNN = 5.02 TeV, possible backgrounds were analysed using MC simulations [95]. Because the collision system,

collision energy and fiducial selections are identical between the two analyses, the same values were assigned in

this thesis. A description of each background will be given here.


   • Heavy quarks, present in beauty or charm hadrons, can decay (semi-)leptonically into a W which then decays

     into a µν pair. If two such decays occur, a muon pair can be formed that could potentially be a background

     in the analysis. To estimate such a contribution, D (B) → µν samples were generated and normalized to their

     production cross section using first order next-to-leading-log (FONLL) [135] calculations and the integrated

     luminosity of the data set used. The FONLL code was interfaced with PYTHIA 6 for the subsequent parton

     shower and decay kinematics. It was found that due to the rapidly decaying pT spectrum, the pT > 20 GeV/c

     cut removes any contributions from this source of background.

   • A pair of t quarks can also produce a pair of muons, in a tt̄ → µµ process. In this case, the decays occur in

     isolated quarks instead of quarks contained in hadrons. The Z/γ ∗ → τ τ → µνµν process was also considered.

     Here, instead of directly decaying into a pair of muons, the Z/γ ∗ first decays into a pair of tauons which then

     decay weakly into a pair of muons and neutrinos. Because the neutrino’s carry away part of the energy,

     the distribution of this process does not follow the peak structure of the direct muon decay. Background

     contributions from these two processes were estimated from a POWHEG simulation, interfaced with PYTHIA

     6. Figure 3.8 shows the distributions of these, compared to the main process of Z/γ ∗ → µµ. As can be seen

     in the figure, in the 60-120 GeV/c2 interval, contributions from these processes are small.


   The fraction of dimuons of these background processes of the main Z/γ ∗ → µµ process (with the same kine-

matic selections applied as in data) was less than 1%. A conservative value of 1% was therefore assigned as the

systematic uncertainty. Note that the backgrounds discussed in this subsection differ from the combinatorial back-

ground described earlier. Namely, they only contribute a systematic uncertainty, while the combinatorial background

is subtracted from the extracted signal to obtain the central value of the number of candidates.



3.6.2    Normalization factor

The systematic uncertainty of the normalization factor arises from the different methods that can be used to deter-

mine it, which give different values of the normalization factor. The central value of the normalization factor is given

by the online method. The systematic uncertainty is then assigned as the largest difference between online method

the values were shown in Tab. 3.5. After the weighted averaging of the three periods, the largest deviation of 0.5%

was kept as the final systematic uncertainty.



3.6.3    Nuclear overlap function

The nuclear overlap function of the Pb–nucleus is obtained from MC Glauber simulations. In the MC Glauber

simulations, the Pb-nuclei in the collisions must be modelled. This is done stochastically by the assignment of

nucleons within the nuclei where the positions of the nucleons are taken from a nuclear density function. For the

latter, a so-called modified Woods-Saxon distribution is used. The distribution contains two parameters: R is the

radius parameter, indicating the size of the Pb–nucleus. The other parameter a is the skin thickness, which is

a measure for how quick the nuclear density decreases at the edge of the nucleus. The parameter values were

obtained from low-energy electron-nucleus experiments. By varying them by one standard deviation from their

central values, systematic uncertainties can be obtained on the hTAA i (shown in Tab. 3.6).



3.6.4    Proton–proton cross section

To compute the Z-boson cross section in pp collisions, two energy scales must be set. These are the factorization

scale and the renormalization scale. The factorization scale µF is the scale at which the PDFs are evaluated. At

energies lower than µF , collisions are considered soft (i.e. non-perturbative), while at energies higher than µF ,

perturbative calculations allow for the determination of scattering matrix elements. The renormalization scale repre-

sents the scale at which ultraviolet divergencies are absorbed by redefining fields. By varying these scales, and the


                                                                                 71


strong coupling constant, systematic uncertainties of the cross section can be obtained. Additionally, uncertainties

in the proton PDFs contribute to the systematic uncertainty of the cross section. The values of the Z-boson cross

section and systematic uncertainties have already been shown in Tab. 3.7.




3.6.5    Centrality estimation


The centrality was estimated using the so-called V0M centrality estimator, defined as the sum of the V0A and V0C

signals. The underlying framework is based on MC Glauber simulations [133, 136]. For the classification of the

centrality percentile, the anchor point (AP) must be determined. This is defined as the V0M amplitude equivalent to

90% centrality. At V0M amplitudes higher than that of the AP, meaning towards more central collisions, the efficiency

and purity of hadronic event selection are considered to be 100%. This means that all hadronic interactions are

measured and that electromagnetic background are fully rejected. At centrality percentiles below the anchor point

(i.e. with centrality above 90%), the efficiency and purity drop, which is why events in that centrality range are

typically rejected for analyses. After the anchor point has been determined, the remaining events are assigned

centrality percentiles, such that the same number of events are present in every 10% of centrality.

   After the anchor point has been determined, the V0M amplitudes that set the centrality percentiles are deter-

mined by integrating the measured amplitude distribution normalized by the full integral defined by the anchor point.

For example, the V0M amplitude for the top 5% centrality class is determined by the point that satisfies

where dNevt /dV is the amplitude distribution of the V0M.

   A systematic uncertainty of 0.5% is assigned to the value of the anchor point [136]. Alternative V0M estimators,

with the anchor point shifted by ±0.5% are also available for centrality estimation. A shift in the anchor point changes

the assignment of the centrality percentile for a given event. Therefore, in a given centrality interval, the number of Z

bosons as well as the number of MB events may change. To first order, the other terms in Eq. 3.1 are not expected to

change due to AP variations. Therefore, the relative uncorrected yield (number of candidates per million MB events)

was computed for both the anchor point shifted up or down by 0.5%. To prevent any biases, the normalization factor

was computed separately for each estimator. The difference in the relative uncorrected yield can be seen in the

last column of Tab. 3.8. For comparison, the central values, obtained with V0M, are shown as well. Half of the

difference between V0Mplus05 and V0Mminus05 was assigned as the systematic uncertainty for each centrality

interval (otherwise the evaluation would be assigned due to a full percent difference in anchor point).

3.6.6    MC - isospin effect on A

In subsection 3.3.1 it was mentioned that both for the embedding as well as the POWHEG simulations, pp collisions

were simulated. However, Pb–Pb collisions also contain contributions from pn (np) and nn collisions. These differ in

the content of up and down quarks. In turn, the difference in up and down quark content can lead to a difference of

the proton/neutron PDFs. The production cross section in nucleon–nucleon collisions σNN is the weighted average

of all binary collision types, according to

and A = 208. The change in production cross section σpp and σNN due to the difference in up and down quark

content is referred to as the isospin effect. For the calculation of the A, it should be verified what the effect is of

only considering pp collisions for the simulations. Using the POWHEG simulations, the A was calculated in two

separate runs (with differing dipole polarity) for all collision types, and the results are shown in Tab. 3.9. Within

uncertainties, for each run all values of the A agree. The isospin effect therefore weakly affects the A for Z bosons

at large rapidity. Therefore, only pp collisions will be considered for its computation in the following.

3.6.7    Trigger, tracking and matching efficiencies

For the calculation of the A, simulations were used. It is therefore vital that the interactions between muons and

the spectrometer, known as the detector response, are properly simulated. An important realization here is that it

does not matter if the detector response itself is not perfect, as long as the simulations show the same behavior.

In this subsection, the systematic uncertainty on the trigger, tracking and matching efficiency in the simulations is

discussed. The exact procedure and estimation of the three uncertainties will be presented in separate paragraphs.

   Trigger efficiency

The response function of the trigger represents the probability to trigger on a muon with a given pT . It is 0 at very

low pT and then sharply increases to a plateau. The response function systematic uncertainty can be divided into

two components. The first component is the shape, which depends on the triggering algorithm, the cluster size, the

strength of the magnetic field and the alignment of the detector. The second component, which is independent from

the first, is the trigger efficiency at the plateau, which depends on the intrinsic chamber efficiency.

   The uncertainty on the shape was investigated in another ALICE analysis. The response functions of the data

and MC were found to overlap, starting at a transverse momentum of pT > 2 GeV/c. Because the current analysis is

done using muons with pT above 20GeV /c, no uncertainty was attributed due to the shape of the response function.

   For the intrinsic chamber efficiency, the uncertainty was determined as follows. From data, a standard chamber

efficiency map can be calculated using some general track selection criteria. A modified map is then calculated by

varying these criteria, and choosing those that yield the largest difference with respect to the standard map. The A

was then computed using both the standard as well as the modified efficiency maps. The difference was taken as

the uncertainty due to the intrinsic chamber efficiency. For the two data taking periods in 2018, the difference was

1%, while for the 2015 period it was 1.5%. In order to simplify the assignment of the uncertainty, and because the

absolute difference is small, an uncertainty of 1.5% was assigned.

   Tracking efficiency

A difference in the tracking performance between the simulations and data can be associated to, for example, a

high-voltage trip of a detector element. Should such a trip occur half way through a run, a detection element is

turned off and this information is then taken into account in the simulation as well. However, in the simulation the

detection element will be rejected for the entire run, leading to a difference. However, differences can already arise

due to different kinematic distributions of the muons in data and simulations, which is unrelated to the tracking

performance of the detector. To prevent biases, dedicated single muon simulations are used which are tuned to

reproduce the single muon distributions that are seen in data. To determine the systematic uncertainty due to

the tracking efficiency, an iterative procedure is applied to ensure that the generated muon distributions (versus y

and pT ) agree with the corrected (by the A) distributions in data. Once satisfactory agreement is reached, the

calculations for the tracking efficiency in the simulations is done.


                                                           74


   The calculation of the tracking efficiency, which is done both in data and in the simulations, goes as follows. The

efficiency per chamber per station is calculated first. Figure 3.9 shows the four ways a muon can interact with a

tracking station: a cluster in both chambers, a cluster in either or a cluster in none.

with the first station is shown as well. Figure provided by [137].


   The efficiency for chamber i (j) can be calculated as


                                                         Nij                 Nij

where Nij is the number of tracks with reconstructed clusters in both chambers of a station and N0j the number

tracks with no reconstructed clusters in chamber i, but with one in chamber j (the other chamber of the same station)

and vice versa for Ni0 . This method relies on the principle that the efficiency for chamber i is independent of that of

chamber j, thus removing the need to know the number of tracks with no reconstructed clusters in either chamber

(which cannot be extracted in data).

   After this, the efficiency per station can be calculated. The calculations per station follow the requirements of the

tracking algorithm. The algorithm requires at least 1 cluster in stations 1, 2 and 3 each, so the efficiency for these

stations is given by

The efficiency of the entire detector is then calculated as the product of the four efficiencies detailed above, tot =

st,1 st,2 st,3 st,45 . This total efficiency tot is then calculated on a run-by-run basis and averaged to a single value per

period. Finally, the difference between the simulation and the data is taken as a systematic uncertainty in the tracking

efficiency. For all three periods, an uncertainty of 1.5% was found for the single muon tracking efficiency. Assuming

the efficiency to be uncorrelated for a dimuon, this yields twice the uncertainty, thus giving a 3% uncertainty for the

dimuon tracking efficiency.

   Trigger-tracking matching

In the analysis, tracks are required to produce clusters in both the tracking as well as the triggering chambers.

These clusters are then used to construct corresponding tracking tracks and trigger tracks. To decide whether the

two tracks match well enough, a χ2 value is computed using certain matching criteria. Tracks with a χ2 higher than

a cutoff value are rejected. In order to compute the systematic uncertainty in the simulations due to the matching

efficiency, the cutoff value was increased by 50%, which increases the efficiency both in data and in simulations. The

difference in this increase between the data and simulations is taken as systematic uncertainty. For single muons,

this is 0.5% such that the uncertainty for dimuons is 1%.



3.6.8    MC - smearing

Detector response

One of the main tasks of the MC simulation is modeling the detector response of the interaction between the muons

and the chambers. As muons pass through the chambers, an electric signal is induced on the cathode pads. The

pads are grouped together to form preclusters, which are fitted with Mathieson functions. From the Mathieson fits,

the clusters and their coordinates are extracted, which serve as input for the tracking algorithm. The clusters have a

certain spatial resolution, which is driven by the intrinsic detector resolution, the precision of the clusters extraction,

and the residual misalignments between the various detection elements.

   The resolution of the chambers can be estimated from fits to cluster-track residuals. These are the distance be-

tween tracks and the clusters used to reconstruct them. Figure 3.10 shows the resolving power for the y-coordinates

per tracking chamber. The lower the value of σ, the smaller the distances that can be differentiated and therefore

the higher the resolution. Not only is the resolution overestimated in the simulations, but there is a strong variability

in the overestimation per chamber.

   A better resolution leads to a higher precision in the momentum estimation, which subsequently leads to nar-

rower reconstructed resonance mass peaks. This means the reconstructed mass peak of the Z is narrower in the

simulations than in data. As a result, the A is higher due to the inclusion of more reconstructed dimuons in the

60-120 GeV/c2 interval. In order to get a more realistic description of the detector response, the track parameters

were smeared to obtain the same resolution as in the data. This smearing was done by a parametrization of the


                                                               76

lations generally overestimate the resolution compared to the data. Figure provided by Ref. [138].



cluster resolution obtained by fitting cluster-track residuals. A Crystal Ball function, tuned to data was used as fitting

function.

   A different parametrization was also tested, tuned to the MC itself. This parametrization was found to yield an

invariant mass distribution nearly identical to that of the MC without smearing. Although this may sound trivial, it

is an important check for the smearing procedure since it is a parametrization which is supposed to replicate the

entire detector response. Figure 3.11 shows the invariant mass spectrum for reconstructed dimuons for the two sets

of smearing parametrizations. The data-tuned CB has a wider distribution and larger tails than the MC-tuned one.

Because the A is calculated specifically over the 60-120 GeV/c2 interval, this decreases the A.

   The smearing is a simple parametrisation of the full detector response, including interactions with the front

absorber and chambers, and also a misalignment of the chambers themselves. Additionally, the smearing does not

take into account chamber-by-chamber variations of the resolution which can vary up to a factor 2 (see Fig. 3.10).

Due to the many uncertainties related to the smearing, it was decided to adopt a conservative estimate for the

systematic uncertainty. The full difference of the A values between the two sets (i.e. CB tuned to the data and CB

tuned to the MC) was assigned as the systematic uncertainty due to the smearing. The full difference amounts to

5% and is the dominant source of uncertainty in the analysis.

   Relative misalignment

For the simulations, alignment files are created from data. From these files, the displacement of subdetectors for

the simulation is obtained. However, it was found in the analysis that when inspecting the per-pair pT difference

∆pT = pT µ+ − pT µ− of the dimuons, the distributions were centered around different values in the simulations than

in data. This was attributed to a remaining relative misalignment of the spectrometer chambers. To take this into

3.6.9    MC - peak shift

Figure 3.3 shows the invariant mass distribution together with the smeared POWHEG distribution, which was nor-

malized such that the integral over 60-120 GeV/c2 was equal to that of the data. A slight shift in the peak of the

distributions appears to be present. In the data, the average mass in the 60-120 GeV/c2 interval was 90.6 ± 1.4

GeV/c2 in 2015 and 87.1 ± 0.9 GeV/c2 in 2018. In the MC simulations, the average was 88.93 ± 0.02 GeV/c2 and

88.53 ± 0.01 GeV/c2 in 2015 and 2018, respectively. The deviation between the data and MC are therefore 1.2 σ in

2015 and 1.6 σ in 2018. They agree relatively well, which can be attributed to the large statistical uncertainty in the

data. Such a shift can influence the A as it is calculated specifically over the [60-120] GeV/c2 interval.

   To compute the effect of a shift, a shift in the peak mass of size S was assumed to be present. In this case, the

simulated spectrum should be shifted by S before calculating the A over the 60-120 GeV/c2 interval. Note however,

that this is mathematically equivalent to integrating the spectrum over the interval [60 − S, 120 − S]. In the following,

the effect of such a shift in integration will be quantified. In the 15o data set, the peak in data occurs at a lower mass

than in the MC, while in 2018 the opposite is true. Therefore, two definitions for S were used, according to



                                               S± = µMC − µdata ± edata                                            (3.19)


where µ represents the mean over the 60-120 GeV/c2 interval and e the error on the mean. The integrals were then

compared to the number of counts in data. For the 15o period, the maximum difference of 0.4% was observed,

while for the 2018 periods, this difference was 0.9%. However, due to the conservative estimate of 5% already

taken into account due to the smearing of the tracks (which can also influence the peak mass), no further systematic

uncertainty for a potential peak shift was assigned.



3.6.10    Summary

To conclude this chapter, Tab. 3.10 shows a summary of all the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis.

Symbols are used to indicate whether an uncertainty is correlated versus centrality and/or rapidity. A correlation of

an uncertainty versus a quantity means that all data points will tend to fluctuate collectively up or down with respect

to their central values. This is in contrast with statistical or uncorrelated systematic uncertainties, where fluctuations

around the central values will occur randomly between different data points.

Z boson: results

The normalized invariant yield and nuclear modification factor, introduced in Chap. 3, are presented for the Z boson

in this chapter. The normalized invariant yield quantifies the production, and will be shown integrated over centrality

and rapidity, as well as a function of each. The nuclear modification factor quantifies deviations between the pro-

duction in Pb–Pb collisions and pp collisions, and will be shown as a function of rapidity and centrality. The results

presented in this chapter were obtained during this thesis and have been published in the Journal of High Energy

Physics [93].

   The data will be compared with various theoretical predictions. Before discussing the results, a brief outline of

the theoretical models is given.



4.1     (nuclear) parton distribution functions

To obtain the theoretical values of the cross sections and invariant yields, the following was done. Simulation codes

that compute partonic cross sections were interfaced with (n)PDF sets (presented in subsection 1.3.1.1) for partonic

distributions. Two such codes were used: Monte Carlo for Femtobarn processes (MCFM) [139] and Fully Exclusive

W and Z (FEWZ) [140]. The two codes are now detailed separately.

   The MCFM code computes cross sections at NLO order and was coupled with the CT14NLO PDF set. From the

CT14NLO PDF set, the proton–proton cross section was computed. The invariant yield and nuclear modification

factor were also computed, but for these the isospin content of the Pb–nuclei was taken into account. However,

no nuclear modifications to the PDFs were considered. To include nuclear modifications, the EPS09 and EPPS16

nPDF sets were used. EPPS16 exclusively provides values integrated over the whole nucleus, meaning no impact

parameter (centrality) dependence is taken into account in the nuclear modifications. In contrast, EPS09s takes into

account a spatial dependence of the nPDFs and therefore is able to provide centrality dependent predictions.

   The other code that was used is the FEWZ code which contains NNLO QCD computations. Although it is in

principle possible to obtain values of the proton–proton cross section, invariant yield and nuclear modification factor

for free-nucleon PDFs from FEWZ as well (in addition to the ones obtained from the MCFM code), they were not

computed. Instead, only nPDF computations were done, coupling the FEWZ code with NCTEQ15 nPDFs. As was

the case for EPPS16, the NCTEQ15 values are computed integrated over the entire Pb–nucleus.




4.2     Invariant yield

                                                                                                µµ
The invariant yield, integrated over the centrality interval 0-90% and rapidity interval 2.5 < ycms < 4.0, is shown

in Fig. 4.1. A previously published measurement from ALICE, with a subsample of the current dataset is also

shown [95]. The publication pertains to an earlier analysis done on only the 2015 dataset. As expected, the inclusion

of the 2018 data in the current analysis decreases the statistical uncertainty of the measurement. The systematic

uncertainty has slightly increased with respect to the previous measurement. More specifically, the increase comes

from a difference in the evaluation of the systematic uncertainty originating from the A correction. In the current

analysis, the procedure to obtain the uncertainty was re-evaluated and a more conservative method was adopted.

The current method yields a systematic uncertainty of 5% for the A correction, while a value of 3.5% was assigned

in the earlier publication.

Figure 4.1: Normalized invariant yield integrated over centrality and rapidity. The measured value is shown along
a previous measurement done over part of the current data sample. For both measurements, lines indicate the
statistical uncertainty while boxes indicate the systematic uncertainty. The green shaded area displays the total
uncertainty of the measurement. Several theoretical computations are shown as well, some of which include nuclear
modifications to PDFs [63, 64, 70, 71, 139, 140]. Figure taken from [93].

   In addition to the measurement itself, Fig. 4.1 shows the predictions from various theoretical models. In general,

there is better agreement between the data and nPDF models than with the free-nucleon model. The nPDF models

have larger theoretical uncertainties because of the convolution of uncertainties in the nuclear modifications on top

of uncertainties in the modeling of the proton (and neutron) PDFs themselves. The EPPS16 calculations contain

a larger uncertainty than the NCTEQ15 and EPS09s models, due to the inclusion of more free parameters in the

model.

   The EPPS16 and NCTEQ15 models only provide predictions integrated over the Pb–nucleus, i.e. over the

centrality interval of 0-100%. In contrast, the measurement was done over the 0-90% centrality interval. However,

because the production of Z bosons scales with the number of binary collisions (as will be shown later), the majority

of Z bosons are produced in central events. The stability of the measurement was tested by estimating the yield in

the 90-100% interval, and using it to compute the yield in the 0-100% interval. The estimation of the yield in the

90-100% interval was done in two ways. The first was to apply binary collision scaling to the yield in 0-90% interval.

This results in a yield in the 0-100% interval that is exactly equal to that in 0-90% by definition of binary scaling.

The second method to estimate the yield in the 90-100% interval was to assume the value given by the CT14NLO

predictions without nuclear modifications. From Fig. 4.1, it can be seen that the CT14NLO value overpredicts the

data, so the estimation obtained from this method provides an upper limit of the yield in the 90-100% interval. The

yield in the 0-100% interval was then computed from the yields in the 0-90% and 90-100% intervals, under the

assumption of binary scaling. The difference in normalized yields of the 0-100% interval between the two methods

is 2 per mille. This means that although the extrapolation of the normalized invariant yield from 0-90% to 0-100%

depends on the modeling of the yield in 90-100%, the uncertainty due to the modeling is more than covered by the

systematic uncertainty of the measurement. In summary, the measurement can be regarded as a measurement

integrated over the full Pb–nucleus.

   Figure 4.1 shows that the CT14NLO computations overestimate the data and this can be understood as follows.

The spectrometer is located away from the interaction point, at forward rapidity. This means that only Z bosons

with large longitudinal momentum will decay in the acceptance of the spectrometer. In collisions of partons with

equal bjorken-x, the net longitudinal momentum of the Z boson is 0, and subsequently no muon pair at large y is

produced. To create a Z boson with large longitudinal momentum, a asymmetry between the x values of the two

colliding partons is necessary. Therefore, the Z bosons that decay in the spectrometer originate from collisions

between low-x and high-x partons. A leading order estimate of the bjorken-x values necessary to create a Z boson

at rapidity y is given by

(such as pp or Pb–Pb), the cms rapidity is equal to the rapidity measured in the laboratory frame. From Eq. 4.1, it

follows that the bjorken-x values probed in the measurement are x1 = [3.3 · 10−4 , 1.5 · 10−3 ] and x2 = [0.22, 0.99].

At low x (< 0.05), nPDFs predict shadowing, meaning that there is a depletion of partons in nuclei compared to

free nucleons. At high x, several competing effects are present. These are a surplus in the antishadowing region at

0.05 < x < 0.3 and a depletion in the EMC region at 0.3 < x < 0.9. At x, 0.9 < x < 1, some nPDF models include

the Fermi region in which another surplus is expected, although uncertainties in this regime are large and not all

nPDF models predict this region. Figure 4.2 shows the nPDF effects described along with the bjorken-x probed in

the Pb–Pb collisions. It should be noted that the given values of x for the transitions between the different nuclear

effects are only a rough estimate. In reality, the exact values depend on the nPDF uncertainties, parton flavor and

scale of the hard process Q. Nevertheless, the convolution of shadowing at low x and the EMC effect at high x can

explain the decrease in the data compared to the CT14NLO-only computations.

   In order to quantify the difference between the CT14NLO-only computations, the deviation between the mea-

sured and predicted yield was calculated as

4.2.1    Differential yields

The data set was large enough to allow for the measurements of differential yields. In this subsection, the normalized

invariant yield will be presented as a function of centrality and of rapidity. The rapidity differential yields were

integrated versus centrality, and vice versa.

   Versus rapidity

Figure 4.3 (left) shows the rapidity distribution of the normalized invariant yield. The measured yields are presented

alongside CT14NLO-only and EPPS16 nPDF calculations. The EPPS16 predictions are in agreement with the
                                                                                                 µµ
data in all rapidity intervals. The free-nucleon predictions agree with the yield in the 2.50 < ycms < 2.75 rapidity

interval. However, at larger rapidities a discrepancy arises between the yield and free-nucleon predictions, as the

free-nucleon predictions overestimate the data. This is expected, as at more forward rapidities, smaller values of x
                                                                                               µµ
are probed, leading to a stronger shadowing effect. The largest difference is found at 3.25 < ycms < 4.00, where the

deviation is 3.3 σ. The deviation found is larger than in the earlier analysis with a subset of the current data, where
                                                   µµ
a maximum deviation of 2 σ was seen in the 3.00 < ycms < 4.00 rapidity bin [95].

   Versus centrality

In Fig. 4.3 (right), the centrality dependence of the normalized invariant yield is shown. The CT14NLO-only predic-

tions are shown as a horizontal band. The reason for this is that they are computed for nucleon–nucleon collisions.

Because centrality is not defined at the nucleon scale, but rather at the nucleus scale, the predictions contain no

centrality dependence and are the same for each centrality interval. The EPS09s model is the only one of the three

nPDF models provided that includes an impact parameter dependence and is therefore shown in the figure as well.

The EPS09s predictions are generally in good agreement with the data, although a slight tension is present in the

0-10% centrality interval. The free-nucleon predictions overestimate the data, showing a maximum deviation of 3.9 σ

in the 0-10% centrality interval. This deviation is larger than the 2.6 σ deviation observed in the 0-20% centrality bin

in the previous analysis.

   The EPS09s predictions show a monotonic increase from the 0-10% to 20-90% interval and the relative differ-

ence between the two intervals is 4.1%. On the other hand, the data show an increase from 0 − 10% to 10 − 20%

centrality, but a decrease from 10 − 20% to 20 − 90%, hinting at the measurement of fluctuations around a common

value.

   The observations are in agreement with the expectation that the invariant yield of colorless hard probes (such

as the Z boson) depends on the number of binary collisions hNcoll i. Because the hTAA i normalizes the yield with

respect to the number of binary nucleon–nucleon collisions per centrality interval, it should be flat as a function

of centrality and this is what is observed. This supports the earlier assumption of binary collision scaling for the

4.3                            Nuclear modification factor

The nuclear modification factor RAA is used to quantify medium effects in heavy-ion collisions. In principle, a mea-

surement of the Z-boson proton–proton cross section should be used for the calculation of the RAA (see Eq. 3.2).
                                                      √
However, the integrated luminosity in pp collisions at s = 5.02 TeV in ALICE is not large enough to allow for such

a measurement at forward rapidity. Instead, a theoretical value of the cross section was used, obtained from the

MCFM code interfaced with the CT14NLO PDFs. An RAA value of 1 typically indicates that there are no dominant

medium effects (or alternatively that there are competing effects that cancel each other). This would imply that

heavy-ion collisions can be described as a superposition of independent nucleon–nucleon collisions. However for

the production of electroweak bosons, the RAA must be interpreted with more caution. The reason for this is that

the RAA is obtained by dividing the invariant yield by specifically the proton–proton cross section. However, con-

tributions from neutrons (isospin) can cause the RAA to deviate from unity even without taking into account nPDF

modifications.

   Versus rapidity

The RAA as a function of rapidity is shown in Fig. 4.4 (left), alongside the CT14NLO-only (including isospin) and

EPPS16 predictions. There is no uncertainty on the values of the free-nucleon predictions, because the proton PDF

uncertainties cancel out in the ratio of the nucleon-nucleon cross section over the proton–proton cross section. The
                                                                    µµ
deviation from unity due to isospin is of the order of +5%. At 2 < ycms < 2.75, the data is well described by both

the CT14NLO-only as well as the EPPS16 predictions. On the other hand, at 2.75 < ycms < 4, the data are in

agreement with EPPS16 but differ from the CT14NLO-only predictions. As is the case for the invariant yield, the

difference between the free-nucleon PDFs and nPDFs grows towards larger rapidities. The deviation between the
                                                                                          µµ
measured RAA and the CT14NLO-only computation is largest in the rapidity interval 3.25 < ycms < 4.00, where

it amounts to 3.3 σ. This deviation is the same as the deviation in the differential invariant yield versus rapidity,

because the addition of the uncertainty of the pp cross section in the data compensates for the loss of of theoretical

uncertainty.

   Versus centrality

Figure 4.4 (right) shows the RAA as a function of centrality. Alongside the data, CT14NLO-only and CT14NLO+EPPS16

predictions are shown. For both theory models, no impact parameter dependence is included in the model, which is

why the predictions are shown as bands. The CT14NLO-only computations overpredict the measured RAA , which

is below unity for all three data points. The CT14NLO+EPPS16 predictions, on the other hand, are in agreement

with the data.

In this section, the results obtained in this thesis are compared to other EW measurements done at the LHC for
                     √
Pb–Pb collisions at sNN = 5.02 TeV. The results will first be compared as a function of rapidity, then as a function

of centrality.

   At ATLAS, the production of W and Z bosons has been studied [142, 143]. For the W bosons, the electron and
                                                                                        `
muon decay channels were measured in the kinematic regime defined by pT ` > 25 GeV/c, |ηcms | < 2.5, pT ν > 25

GeV/c, mT > 40 GeV/c. Here, ` stands for the lepton, ν for the (anti)neutrino and mT > 40 represents the transverse

mass of the lepton and neutrino system. A measurement of Z bosons was also done, in the kinematic regime of
                   `
pT ` > 20 GeV/c, |ηcms | < 2.5 and dilepton mass 66 < m`` < 116 GeV/c2 . For both the W and Z bosons, the electron

and muon decay channels were combined, and the normalized invariant yield and RAA versus centrality and rapidity

were measured. At CMS, Z bosons were measured in the electron and muon decay channels in the kinematic
         `
regime |ηcms                                                                                   ``
             | < 2.4 (2.1) for muons (electrons), pT ` > 20 GeV/c, 60 < m`` < 120 GeV/c2 and |ycms | < 2.1 [144].

The decay channels were combined and the production cross section as a function of rapidity and the normalized

invariant yield versus centrality were measured.

   Production versus rapidity

Both the ATLAS and CMS data were measured at midrapidity, whereas the ALICE data were measured at forward

rapidity. Nuclear effects are generally more pronounced at forward rapidity and the data show that free-nucleon

PDFs and nPDF predictions at midrapidity are closer to each other than at forward rapidity. In both the ATLAS and

CMS data, the difference between free-nucleon and nPDF predictions grows at larger rapidity. Figure 4.5 shows that

a light preference for free-nucleon computations is present in the ATLAS W and Z boson measurements as well as

the CMS Z boson measurement. Also at both experiments, both the free-nucleon and nPDF predictions consistently

underestimate the data. In the ATLAS Z-boson measurement, the models underpredict the data by 1 − 3 deviations,

where the larger deviations are found at forward rapidities [143]. The production of W bosons is underestimated by

2 − 3% by the CT14NLO-only computations [142]. However, the authors of [142] note that already in pp collisions
  √
at s = 5.02 TeV, the CT14NLO-only predictions underestimate the W data by roughly 1 σ [91]. The CMS Z-boson

data lie on the upper edge of the CT14NLO-only predictions. In contrast to the ATLAS measurements, data from pp
              √
collisions at s = 13 TeV are well described by CT14NLO-only predictions within theoretical uncertainties [145].

   A direct comparison of the yields at different experiments cannot be made due to the different kinematic regimes

in which the measurements were performed. Instead, Fig. 4.6 shows the ratio of the data divided by the CT14NLO-

only predictions as a function of rapidity. It should be noted that at ATLAS and ALICE, the normalised invariant

yield was measured, while at CMS the cross section was measured. At midrapidity both CMS and ATLAS data are

systematically above the CT14NLO-only predictions. Both experiments show a light preference for the CT14NLO-

only predictions over EPPS16 nPDF predictions. At forward rapidity, the shadowing and EMC effects become more

   Production versus centrality

In the ATLAS measurements, the RAA of the W and Z bosons are consistent with a constant value, although for

all three bosons, a light increase in RAA towards peripheral collisions is seen in Fig. 4.7 (left). The CMS data on

Fig. 4.7 (right) show the normalized invariant yield as a function of centrality, rather than the RAA . However, the

conversion to RAA is done by dividing the normalized invariant yield by the pp cross section which is the same for

all centrality bins. The rescaling of the y-axis on the plot will therefore have no effect on the trend of the data. In the

CMS data, a decrease is seen in the normalized invariant yield in peripheral collisions. This observation seems to

be in conflict with the trend of the ATLAS measurements. Earlier measurements of W and Z bosons by both ATLAS

and CMS were not sensitive enough to such changes in the production as a function of centrality, because the data

were less precise (especially in the peripheral events) [144].

   An ALICE analysis of the RAA of charged particles in Pb–Pb collisions at          sNN = 5.02 TeV as a function of

centrality showed that the RAA in peripheral collisions (above 80%) was below unity. This was attributed to biases

originating from collision geometry and criteria for event selection. These biases lead to an apparent suppression

in peripheral events. A modified version of PYTHIA, called HG-PYTHIA was created in which the collision geometry

and event selection biases are included [147]. Both plots in Figure 4.7 show predictions using the HG-PYTHIA

simulations. The trend of decreasing normalized invariant yield in peripheral events in CMS data is in agreement

with values from the HG-PYTHIA model. On the other hand, in ATLAS no such decrease is observed, and the data

are in contrast with the values from HG-PYTHIA.

   An explanation for the apparent increase of the ATLAS data was proposed in Ref. [148]. For the computation

of centrality dependent quantities, the nuclear overlap hTAA i is necessary, which is obtained from Glauber MCs.
                                                                                     inel
One of the inputs for the Glauber MC is the inelastic nucleon–nucleon cross section σnn   . The authors note that
     inel
the σnn   is generally obtained from extrapolations of proton–proton data. They suggest that in heavy-ion collisions,
                                                  inel
shadowing effects might lead to a lower value of σnn   . By equating the theoretical and experimental formulae of the
                            inel
RAA , a different value of σnn   can be extracted. Instead of the commonly used value of 70 mb, a value of 41.5+16.2
                                                                                                               −12.0

mb is found. With this lower value, the hTAA i can be recomputed as well as the centrality dependence of the W and

Z production. With the new hTAA i values, the increasing trend towards peripheral collisions vanishes and the EW

production measured in ATLAS becomes flat as a function of centrality. However, it should be noted that in the CMS

data, no discrepancies with the Glauber MC are observed, and therefore do not require a shadowed inelastic cross

section to describe the data. In the analysis done in this thesis, the RAA as a function of centrality is consistent

Z boson: LHC Run 3 projections

For the LHC Run 3 data taking period, special runs involving oxygen nuclei instead of lead nuclei have been pro-

posed. The purpose of these special runs would be to complement existing data from Pb and Xe collisions. In this

chapter, their relevance for measurements of Z-boson production for nPDF studies is discussed.

   The LHC has provided numerous data points involving Pb–nuclei that can be included in nPDF fits. However,

there are few data at high energy with nuclei other than Pb. As a result, the A-dependence (atomic mass number)

of nPDFs is not well understood. This creates a need for measurements at high energy with A << 208. The isotope

considered for the oxygen runs is 16 O8+ . Therefore, data from p–O and O–O collisions would be well suited to shed

light on this A-dependence.

   This chapter will detail the projections of Z-boson production in p–O and O–O collisions in LHC Run 3 in order

to determine whether measurements might be feasible.



5.1    p–O and O–O data taking configurations

At the time of writing, the specific collision energies and configurations have not yet been finalized. Several con-

figurations are being considered, which will be discussed here. The final configurations will be decided based on

accelerator capabilities, time constraints (only a certain number of days are allotted for the oxygen data taking)
                                                                     √
and physical motivations (such as having a pp baseline already at s = 7 TeV). The oxygen runs are planned

oxygen data taking, the corresponding center of mass energy per nucleon pair will be sNN = 9 TeV in p–O colli-

sions and sNN = 6.37 TeV in O–O collisions. To facilitate a more direct comparison between Pb–Pb data taken
   √
at sNN = 5.02 TeV, the possibility of O–O collisions at the same energy is under consideration. However, this

would require two additional days of setup time and is currently not the preferred configuration. In contrast to p–Pb

collisions, where data taking generally occurs both in proton–going (forward) and Pb–going (backward) directions,

only proton–going collisions are considered for the p–O collisions.

   The expected integrated luminosity for the p–O collisions is 5 nb−1 , while it is 1 nb−1 for the O–O collisions

(ranging from 0.5 to 4 nb−1 ).




5.2       Extrapolation method

The projections were obtained by extrapolating existing measurements of the Z-boson pp cross section. In pp

collisions, there is no measurement at forward rapidity in ALICE due to limited luminosity. Therefore, an LHCb
                   √
measurement at s = 7 TeV was taken instead [149]. Alternatively, a pp cross section can be approximated from

a measured p–Pb cross section using A × σpp = σpA . For this, an ALICE measurement from p–Pb collisions at
√
  sNN = 8.16 TeV was used [93]. The formula used to calculate the projected measured yield is

where the superscript config refers to the configuration of the measurement. This includes the collision system (p–O

or O–O), center-of-mass energy and rapidity (either forward or backward). L represents the integrated luminosity,

while A is the detector reconstruction and selection efficiency, and A1 and A2 refer to the mass numbers of the

colliding hadrons. Lastly, the pp cross section is corrected for differences in acceptance and energy between the

measurement and the projection configuration. These corrections are given by Cacc and Cenergy respectively. They

were obtained with PYTHIA simulations and are detailed in the remainder of this section.



5.2.1     Acceptance and energy corrections

5.2.1.1   PYTHIA setup

Existing measurements were extrapolated to obtain the projections in p–O and O–O collisions. However, Z-boson

production depends on the collision energy and system as well as detector acceptance and kinematic selections.

Corrections were therefore applied to accommodate for this dependence. The corrections were obtained with

PYTHIA 6.4 simulations, in which Z bosons were generated and subsequently forced to decay into dimuons [131].

Per event, one Z boson was generated and for each configuration 50000 events were simulated. The Z bosons were

generated with a rapidity −12 < y < 12. In order to compute the acceptance corrections between different fiducial

rapidity ranges, no kinematic selections were applied on the decay muons at the generated level.

   Isospin was taken into account in the simulations by simulating separately pp, pn, np and nn collisions. Depend-

ing on the collision configuration (p–O or O–O), different contributions of binary collisions were considered. Also,

in configurations involving nuclei, nuclear modifications of PDFs were included. For example, for pp simulations in


                                                            93


p–O configuration the parton from one proton is sampled from a free-proton PDF, while the parton from the other

proton is sampled from a nuclear PDF of oxygen. Additionally, in asymmetric collisions, the center-of-mass frame
                                           
was boosted according to ∆y = 0.5 ln Z 1 A2
                                      Z2 A1   where Z and A represent respectively the atomic and mass number

of the colliding hadrons. The rapidity boost introduces a global shift of the rapidity distribution, while isospin and

nuclear modifications influence the shape of the distribution as well as the total cross section. Lastly, it should

be noted that the detector reconstruction and selection efficiency is treated separately in Eq. 5.1. Therefore, the

kinematic output from PYTHIA was studied directly instead of passing it through the detector interaction and data

reconstruction chain.

   In the following, the acceptance and energy correction are separately detailed.


5.2.1.2   Acceptance correction

The acceptance correction Cacc takes into account differences in the rapidity distribution of fiducial Z bosons (defined

below) in different collision systems and energies. An example of the Z-boson rapidity distributions of pp collisions
   √                                                             √
at s = 7 TeV and pp collisions (in p–O configuration) at sNN = 9 TeV without kinematic selections is shown in
                                                                                            8·1
                                                                                                
Fig. 5.1 (left). As seen in the plot, the difference of their means is −0.28, while 0.5 ln 1·16   ≈ −0.35. The discrepancy

arises because isospin and the nPDFs skew the distribution of the p–O configuration towards negative rapidities,

which lowers the mean.

   However, because the experimentally measured cross sections are fiducial, the kinematic selections on the

decay muons must also be taken into account. Fig. 5.1 (right) shows the rapidity distributions in the same config-

urations, but now of the fiducial Z bosons. Fiducial Z bosons are defined as those Z bosons that satisfy certain

kinematic selections on the decay muons. In this case, both decay muons were required to have pT > 20 GeV/c

and a dimuon mass of 60 < mµµ < 120 GeV/c2 . A selection on the pseudorapidity of the muons was also applied.

For ALICE measurements, this selection was 2.5 < η < 4.0 or −4.0 < η < −2.5 at forward and backward rapidity

respectively. For LHCb measurements, the muons were required to have 2.0 < η < 4.5.

   Finally, Cacc is given by the ratio of fiducial Z bosons in two different collision configurations. To account for

isospin, the number of fiducial Z bosons for each configuration was averaged over the relevant contributions of

binary collisions using Eq. 5.2 and 5.3.

5.2.1.3    Energy correction


At the end of each simulation, PYTHIA outputs the cross section for the processes it generates. These cross

sections were used to correct for the energy dependence of measured cross sections. This was necessary because

the measured cross sections are generally at different energies than those needed for the projections. The energy

correction Cenergy is given by the ratio of the PYTHIA cross section in two different configurations. As for the

acceptance correction, an isospin-weighted average of the cross section was computed following Eq. 5.2 and 5.3
                                                                                                        √

5.3        Pythia simulation internal cross-checks

In order to compute the projections with Eq. 5.1, corrections for acceptance and energy differences are necessary.

These corrections were obtained from PYTHIA simulations. However, in order to apply them, it must be verified that

the rapidity distributions of the (fiducial) Z bosons and cross sections in PYTHIA match those of the data. In order

to test the corrections, Eq. 5.1 was applied to compute various cross sections that have already been measured.

By doing this, a direct comparison can be made between PYTHIA calculations and data and thereby justify the

correction factors.


                                                                       95


   This section is dedicated to several consistency checks done with the PYTHIA simulations. The cross-checks

on the total cross sections (used for the energy correction) and rapidity distributions (used for the acceptance

corrections) are detailed in the following subsections.



5.3.1    Cross section in PYTHIA

In this subsection, the cross sections outputted by PYTHIA are compared with data. In addition to the value of the

cross sections themselves, i.e. the absolute cross sections, the ratio between cross sections at different energies

are also compared between PYTHIA and data.

   Absolute cross sections in PYTHIA

The PYTHIA cross sections were compared with two LHCb measurements of the pp cross section at forward rapidity
  √               √
at s = 7 TeV and s = 8 TeV [149, 150]. For the comparisons, the PYTHIA value of the total cross section was

multiplied by the fraction of fiducial Z’s to obtain the expected forward cross section in the LHCb acceptance. This

was done because the values given by the LHCb measurements pertain to fiducial cross sections.
     √
  At s = 7 TeV, the total cross section is 676 pb and the fraction of fiducial Z’s in the LHCb acceptance is 7.8%,

leading to a fiducial cross section of 52 pb. This is lower than the measured value of 76.0 ± 0.3 ± 0.5 ± 1.0 ± 1.3 pb,

where the uncertainties are respectively statistical, systematic, due to the beam energy and due to the luminosity. At
√
  s = 8 TeV, the total cross section is 795 pb with a fiducial fraction of 8.6%, leading to a fiducial cross section of 69

pb. Again, the PYTHIA value is lower than the measured value of 95.0 ± 0.3 (stat) ± 0.7 (syst) ± 1.1 (beam energy) ±

1.1 (luminosity). The discrepancy can be explained by the fact that PYTHIA calculates the cross sections at leading

order. Contributions from next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) calculations can be

significant. In particular, going from LO to NLO can increase the total cross section by as much as 22%, although

the exact value depends on the PDF set used to compute the cross section [151]. NNLO corrections show smaller

differences of the order of 2-3% compared to NLO computations [151]. However, the higher-order corrections are

beyond the scope of the estimate of the projections presented in this chapter.

   Relative changes in cross sections in PYTHIA

In the corrections for energy, the ratio of cross sections at different energies were used. In in the previous check,

it was found that the absolute cross sections do not reflect the values found in data. It was therefore investigated

whether the relative changes in the cross section in PYTHIA could be correct despite this. For this, the same two
                                                                                     √
LHCb measurements from the above cross-check were used. The cross section at s = 8 TeV was computed
                                      √
from the measured cross section at s = 7 TeV and the energy correction Cenergy . In addition to the energy

correction, an acceptance correction was applied because at higher energy, the rapidity distribution widens which

leads to more (fiducial) Z bosons in the LHCb acceptance. Equation 5.1 was used, with an acceptance correction
                                                                                                         √
of Cacc = 1.11 ± 0.2 and energy correction of Cenergy = 1.18. The corresponding expected cross section at s =


                                                           96


8 TeV is 99.2 ± 2.3 pb, which is reasonably compatible with the reported value of 95.0 ± 0.3 (stat) ± 0.7 (syst) ±

1.1 (beam energy) ± 1.1 (luminosity). This means that the ratio of cross sections at different energies in PYTHIA is

a good proxy for the ratio in data.




5.3.2    Rapidity distributions in PYTHIA

In this subsection, two verifications of the rapidity distributions are shown. First the ALICE cross section in p–Pb
   √                                                                     √
at sNN = 8.16 TeV is computed from the LHCb pp cross section at s = 8 TeV. Secondly, the forward/backward
                                         √
ratio is calculated in p–Pb collisions at sNN = 8.16 TeV in ALICE.
                                      √                                                     √
   ALICE p–Pb cross section at            sNN = 8.16 TeV from LHCb pp cross section at          s = 8 TeV

To compute the expected cross section in the ALICE measurement, Eq. 5.1 was used. For p–Pb collisions, the
                                                      √
product of A1 and A2 is 208. The LHCb cross section at s = 8 TeV is 95 pb [150], with an acceptance correction

of Cacc = 0.51 ± 0.01 and an energy correction of Cenergy = 0.98. For the energy correction, it can be seen that the

decrease of the cross section due to shadowing is stronger than the increase due to the higher energy, leading to
                                                        ALICE(PYTHIA)
a value smaller than unity. The computed value of σpP b,8.16T eV        = 9.9 ± 0.3 nb is consistent with the measured

value of 10.3 ± 1.4 (stat) ± 0.9 (syst) nb.
                                                       √
   Forward/backward ratio in p–Pb collisions at            sNN = 8.16 TeV

Another way to test the rapidity distribution generated by PYTHIA is to compare the ratios of the forward and
                                                                                           √
backward cross section in p–Pb collisions. In PYTHIA pp collisions in p–Pb configuration at sNN = 8.16 TeV,

the number of fiducial Z bosons at forward rapidity is 2241, while it is 825 at backward rapidity. This leads to a

forward/backward ratio of 2.7 ± 0.1. The cross sections measured in ALICE are σpPb,forward = 10.3 ± 1.4 (stat) ±

0.9 (syst) nb and σpPb,backward = 3.7 ± 0.6 (stat) ± 0.3 (syst). Assuming the statistical uncertainty to be uncorrelated

and the systematic uncertainty to be fully correlated, the forward/backward ratio in data is 2.8 ± 0.6 (stat) ± 0.1 (syst).

This is consistent with the value found with PYTHIA.

   LO versus NLO distributions

In the PYTHIA simulations, LO computations were done to compute the Z-boson cross section. It already was

mentioned that higher order computations are necessary to properly describe absolute cross sections. To investigate

the influence of higher order corrections to the rapidity distribution, Z bosons were generated at NLO in POWHEG

simulations. Figure 5.2 shows the rapidity distributions of generated fiducial Z bosons, with the fiducial region

specified for the ALICE analysis. The right plot shows the ratio of the PYTHIA over POWHEG distributions, which

only deviates from unity at the edge of the fiducial region where few Z bosons are generated. This means that the

LO distributions from which the acceptance correction Cacc was computed are sufficient for the projections in p–O

and O–O collisions.

5.3.3      Conclusions from cross checks

Two conclusions were drawn from the cross checks. The first is that the rapidity distributions in data are well

described by PYTHIA simulations using computations at LO. Secondly, although the absolute cross sections differ

from those measured, relative differences in the LO PYTHIA cross sections at different energies are similar to relative

differences in measured cross sections. This validates the use of the PYTHIA simulations for the projections, as

described in Eq. 5.1.



5.4        Results

In this section, the values of the estimated measured yields are presented. To compute them, Eq. 5.1 was used.

The values of the detector reconstruction and selection efficiency A and product of atomic mass numbers A1 A2

depend on the collision configuration. Therefore, the projections for p–O collisions and O–O collisions are each

detailed in separate subsections.



5.4.1      p–O projections

In p–O collisions, the product of A1 and A2 is 16. The detector reconstruction and selection efficiency is assumed to
                                                √
be the same as in the ALICE p–Pb analysis at sNN = 8.16 TeV, in which the value was A = 0.74. The projections
                                                                      √
have been computed using separately the LHCb pp measurement at s = 7 TeV and ALICE p–Pb measurement at
√
  sNN = 8.16 TeV mentioned in Sec. 5.2. To use the p–Pb measurement for the computation of the projections, the

p–Pb cross sections was first be converted into a pp cross section by σpp = σpA /A. The uncertainty on each cross

section represents the total uncertainty, computed by assuming that all given uncertainties in the corresponding


                                                                  98


  measurement are uncorrelated. It was mentioned earlier that currently, only collisions in the p–going directions are

  foreseen. However, projections for O–going collisions are also shown, as the collision configurations are not yet

  finalized.

     The various values of the pp cross section, Cacc , Cenergy and the expected measured yield are shown in Tab. 5.1.

  It can be seen in the table that expected yields between the two different input measurements agree well with

  each other. However, the uncertainty on the projection from the p–Pb measurement has a much larger uncertainty

  than the projection from the pp measurement. This is caused by the larger relative uncertainty in the reference

  measurement itself (16% versus 2.6% uncertainty in the pp measurement).

  5.4.2    O–O projections

  In the calculation of the p–O projections, the values obtained using the ALICE measurement were found to be

  consistent with the one using the LHCb measurement, though with a higher uncertainty. Consequently, for the O–O
                                              √
  projections only the LHCb pp measurement at s = 7 TeV was used. In contrast to the p–O projections, the product

  of A1 and A2 in O–O collisions is 162 = 256. The detector reconstruction and selection efficiency depends on the

  occupation level, which will be higher in O–O collisions than in p–O collisions. Charged particle multiplicities in
                                                                                   √
  O–O collisions are expected to be similar to those found in Pb–Pb collisions at sNN = 5.02 TeV in the 70-90%

  centrality interval [152]. From the Z-boson measurement in Pb–Pb collisions described in this thesis, the efficiency

  in this centrality interval is A = 0.73. As O–O collisions are symmetric, the projections were computed for only one

  rapidity window.
                                                                                            √

5.4.3    Experimental uncertainties

The kinematic selections on the dimuons ensure that background in the measurement is roughly 1% in p–Pb col-
                                        √
lisions, and smaller than 1% in Pb–Pb at sNN = 5.02 TeV (as explained in subsection 3.6.1). Because of this,

the signal extraction is done by counting the number of entries in the 60 < mµµ < 120 GeV/c2 mass interval. Con-

sequently, the uncertainty on the signal extraction is the square root of the number of entries. This uncertainty

dominates the statistical uncertainty of the measurement.

   The systematic uncertainties in the p–Pb and Pb–Pb measurements are dominated by the uncertainty in the

calculation of the detector efficiency. This uncertainty arises from discrepancies in the detector response in the MC

simulations used to calculate the efficiency. At the current time, it is unclear whether the detector response can be

more accurately simulated during LHC Run 3. Therefore, as a conservative estimate, the same order of magnitude

of systematic uncertainty is expected. This ranges from 6.2 to 8.2%.



5.4.4    Comparison with p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions

In section 4.2, the nuclear effects probed in Pb–Pb collisions were discussed. The effects probed depend on

the momentum fraction x of the partons in the collisions. To see if p–O and O–O collisions are sensitive to the

same physics, a comparison of the bjorken-x values is shown in Tab. 5.3. For completeness, p–Pb collisions at
√                   √
  sNN = 5.02 TeV and sNN = 8.16 TeV are also included, as measurements in ALICE have been done in those

configurations. Equation 4.1 was used to obtain the values of bjorken-x. For p–O and p–Pb collisions, the boost

of the center-of-mass frame was taken into account by shifting the rapidity measured in the laboratory frame by

∆y = 0.347 and ∆y = 0.465 respectively.

   At backward rapidity, all configurations probe bjorken-x values of the order of [10−4 , 10−3 ], which indicates

sensitivity to nuclear shadowing. At forward rapidity, the bjorken-x probed in p–O and O–O collisions is smaller than

those in p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions. As a result, the measurements will be less sensitive to both the EMC and

antishadowing effect. Because these are competing effects, the decrease in sensitivity to both could compensate.

In the end, the nuclear effects probed by the p–O and O–O collisions will be similar to those in p–Pb and Pb–Pb

collisions.




5.5     Conclusions

The projections per nb−1 for p–O and O–O collisions are summarized in Table 5.4. Given the expected luminosities

of 5 nb−1 for p–O collisions and 1 nb−1 for O–O collisions, the yields would be respectively 3 and 4 Z bosons. With

these yields, a measurement of Z-boson production during the oxygen runs will not be feasible.

   To obtain a similar number of candidates as were used in the p–Pb and Pb–Pb measurement (64 and 208

J/ψ pair production: analysis method and

In this chapter the measurement of the di-J/ψ (or J/ψ pair) cross section is presented. All J/ψ are studied in their

dimuon decay channel, and the cross section is calculated as

   In the following sections, the event and track selection for this analysis will be detailed, followed by a separate

section for each of the terms in Eq. 6.1. Finally, the obtained cross section is presented.




6.1     Event selection
                                                                       √
The di-J/ψ analysis is done on the Run-2 dataset of pp collisions at       s = 13 TeV at the LHC. The data were collected

from 2016 to 2018. Data taken in 2015 were not considered for the analysis, even though they also comprise pp
             √
collisions at s = 13 TeV and were part of the Run-2 data taking. The reason for excluding the 2015 data is that the

data taking conditions (such as trigger conditions of the spectrometer) were different than for the 2016-2018 data,

which complicates their integration. The 2015 data represent about 10% of the entire Run-2 dataset, so that their

omission does not strongly reduce the size of the data sample [153].

   The analysis was done on CMUL7 events, which were detailed in subsection 3.1.1. A physics selection was

applied on the CMUL7 events to remove background collisions. The procedure to remove these background events

in Pb–Pb collisions was also explained in subsection 3.1.1. Additional criteria are applied to pp events. Because

the instantaneous luminosity is higher in pp collisions than in Pb–Pb collisions, it is possible for two distinct pp

collisions to occur within a single event. Such an event is then considered a pileup event. There are two categories

of pileup events. The first is same-bunch pileup when there are two or more collisions occurring in the same bunch

crossing. The second category is out-of-bunch pileup, when there are two or more collisions in a bunch crossing

separate from the one that triggered the acquisition. The rate of out-of-bunch pileup depends on the readout time

of a detector. For example, the SPD has a large readout time of 300 ns, which corresponds to 12 bunch crossings.

Using information from the V0, which has a readout time of 25 ns, out-of-bunch pileup within the SPD readout time

can be rejected. Additionally, the presence of multiple reconstructed vertices in the SPD can be used to tag pileup

from same-bunch-crossing collisions and out-of-bunch pileup within the SPD readout time. An event is tagged

as pileup and removed if there are multiple vertices separated more than 0.8 cm along the beam axis. A more

refined pileup removal involves specifying the number of contributors Ncont to each vertex, depending on the event

multiplicity. The latter is approximated by the number of SPD tracklets (i.e. line segments reconstructed using only

SPD hits) Ntracklets . For this multiplicity-dependent pileup removal, events are rejected if there are multiple vertices

more than 0.8 cm separated along the beam axis and Ncont ≥ 3 for events with Ntracklets < 20, Ncont ≥ 4 for events

with 20 < Ntracklets < 50 and Ncont ≥ 5 for events with Ntracklets > 50. The pileup rejection criteria are based on the

number of SPD tracklets from which the vertices are reconstructed. For collisions with interaction vertices that are

strongly displaced along the z-axis, a large number of the outgoing particles may lie outside of the SPD acceptance.

This decreases the efficiency of the pileup removal using SPD tracklets. As such, the rejection criteria are tuned to

collisions whose z-coordinate is displaced less than 10 cm from the nominal interaction point, which coincides with

the center of the SPD. The same selection is therefore also applied in the data, requiring events with |Vz | < 10 cm.

    The number of events at various stages of the selection criteria are shown in Table. 6.1.

6.1.1     Track selection

The selection criteria on the muon tracks are almost identical to those for the Z-boson analysis, described in sub-

section 3.1.2. The only difference is that for the J/ψ, no requirement is set for the pT of the muons, whereas in

the Z-boson analysis a transverse momentum pT > 20 GeV/c was required. The condensed list of track selection

criteria is

6.2     Signal extraction

The (di-)J/ψ are reconstructed in their muonic decay channels in the spectrometer. A 2-dimensional invariant mass

spectrum is computed from all combinations of double dimuon pairs (each dimuon consisting of an unlike-sign muon

pair) per event. The 2D mass spectrum obtained over the full data sample is shown in Figure 6.1. No ordering of

the indices 1 and 2 was done for the spectrum. In total, 2575 quadrimuon pairs were found in the invariant mass

range [2, 5] GeV/c2 ×[2, 5] GeV/c2 .

   The di-J/ψ signal is obtained from a 2D fit to the 2D invariant mass spectrum. However, a 1D fit is done first, to

obtain the parameters of the single J/ψ fit functions which enter in the 2D fit function.



6.2.1    Fit configurations

In the following subsections, the 1D and 2D fits are described. For the fits, various configurations were used. The fit

configurations differ in the background functions, parameters for signal functions, and the mass interval over which

the fit was performed. A description of the configurations is now given.


                                                                                                        104


   The signal function of the J/ψ (and ψ(2S)) is always taken to be an extended Crystal Ball (CB2) function. The

CB2 function consists of a gaussian core together with two exponential tails. In the fits, the tail parameters are

always kept fixed. There are two separate sets of values to which they can be fixed. One set was obtained from fits

to data while letting all tail parameters free. Another was obtained by the same procedure, but using MC simulations

instead of data.

   To fit the combinatorial background, three different functions were used. These are an exponential of a 2nd-order

polynomial, a double exponential, and a ratio of a first-order polynomial over a second-order polynomial.

   Lastly, two mass ranges were considered for the fits: [2.0, 4.5] GeV/c2 and [2.2, 4.9] GeV/c2 ranges.

   Analytic expressions of the functions mentioned above, as well as a table containing the tail parameters of the

CB2 function are given in Appendix A. All combinations of the above variations were used as fit configurations. The

3 different background functions, 2 sets of tail parameters and 2 fit intervals therefore lead to 12 different values for

the signal extraction. In the following subsections, example plots of the fits will be shown. The same fit configuration

will be used for all example plots. The configuration pertains to the fit using an exponential of 2nd order polynomial

as background function, using the tail parameters obtained from fits to data for the signal functions, fitted over the

mass range of [2, 4.5] GeV/c2 .



6.2.2    1-dimensional fits

For the 1D fits, the entire single dimuon invariant mass spectrum (i.e. not only the dimuons obtained in the di-J/ψ

signal extraction) was computed. The large number of dimuons in the data sample will allow to establish the fit

parameters of the single J/ψ with high accuracy. The 1D fits consist of three separate steps.

   In the first step, only a background function is fitted, simultaneously over the invariant mass intervals [mmin , 2.8]

GeV/c2 and [3.4, mmax ] GeV/c2 , where mmin and mmax are respectively the minimum and maximum mass of the fit

range considered. The intervals were chosen to avoid the J/ψ and ψ(2S) signal regions. The first step then yields

initial values of the background parameters.

   In the second step, the J/ψ signal function is added. A fit of the combined background and J/ψ functions is

then done around the J/ψ invariant mass peak of [3.026, 3.167] GeV/c2 . In this fit, the parameters of the background

function are kept fixed, and the tails of the CB2 function are also fixed.

   In the third step, the ψ(2S) signal function is added. The signal function of the ψ(2S) is also a CB2 function with

the same tails as the J/ψ signal function. Furthermore, the gaussian mean of the ψ(2S) is set to the gaussian mean

of the J/ψ signal function, shifted by the difference of their PDG mass. The gaussian width of the ψ(2S) is set to 1.05

times the width of the J/ψ signal function. Ultimately, only the normalisation of the ψ(2S) signal function is kept as

a free parameter. For the third fit, all background parameters (including normalisation) are set free. The gaussian

mean and width of the J/ψ signal function as well as the normalisation of the J/ψ and ψ(2S) signals are also set free.


                                                          105


The third and final fit is done over the full mass interval considered. An example of the completed fit results after the

third step is shown in Fig. 6.2.

6.2.3    2-dimensional fits

After the 1-dimensional fits have been obtained, a 2-dimensional fit function is defined. This is done by introducing

a second invariant mass variable m2 , and essentially create a copy of the 1D signal function, but as a function of

m2 . The 2-dimensional fit function F is then defined as


                   F (m1 , m2 ) = N(J/ψ)1 ,(J/ψ)2 J/ψ 1 (m1 )J/ψ 2 (m2 ) + NB1 ,(J/ψ)2 B1 (m1 )J/ψ 2 (m2 )
                                                                                                                                           (6.2)
                                   + N(J/ψ)1 ,B2 J/ψ 1 (m1 )B2 (m2 ) + NB1 ,B2 B1 (m1 )B2 (m2 ),


where N(J/ψ)1 ,(J/ψ)2 represents the number of di-J/ψ, NB1 ,(J/ψ)2 and N(J/ψ)1 ,B2 represent the mixed background

(meaning a J/ψ from one variable and a background dimuon from the other) and NB1 ,B2 represents the pure back-

ground (meaning background dimuons from both variables). The bolded J/ψ and B indicate the J/ψ signal function

and the background function respectively, as a function of the first invariant mass variable m1 or the second invari-

ant mass variable m2 . The ψ(2S) signal function is not included in the 2-dimensional fit, as its contributions are

expected to be negligible.

   In the 2D fit, the background function is kept the same, although the parameters are left free because the

combinatorial background is not expected to be the same for di-J/ψ as for single J/ψ. For the J/ψ signal, the function

is kept the same and the parameters are fixed to those obtained from the 1D fit. This is done because the J/ψ signal

is mainly driven by the detector response. The data shown in Fig. 6.1 are then fitted to the 2D function in Eq. 6.2.

                               From the 2D fit, the number of di-J/ψ is extracted. As mentioned before, 12 different fit configurations were used,

which leads to 12 different signal extractions shown in Figure 6.4. The average of all configurations is taken to be the

final value of the signal extraction. The statistical uncertainty is the average of the uncertainty of each configuration,

and the systematic uncertainty is the standard deviation of the central values. The number of di-J/ψ pairs found is

finally 59.3 ± 13.5 (stat) ± 4.4 (syst).

Due to time constraints, it was not possible to compute the values of the single J/ψ A from simulations in this

thesis. The value was therefore taken from another analysis done on single J/ψ over the same data set. However,

this can only be done if the pT and rapidity distributions of the J/ψ in the di-J/ψ are similar to those of single J/ψ.

The normalised pT and rapidity distributions of single dimuons as well as of the dimuons comprising the di-dimuons

signal (i.e. for each di-dimuon, the two dimuon comprising it were evaluated separately) are shown in Figure 6.5.

A selection on the invariant mass of 2.9 < MJ/ψ < 3.3 GeV/c2 was applied, in order to enhance the J/ψ signal /

background ratio so that the J/ψ kinematics are dominant in the pT and y distributions. For the di-dimuons, the low

number of entries enhances the effect of statistical fluctuations. In the pT distributions, the means differ by 0.26

GeV/c (8%), while the means of the rapidity distributions differ by 0.03 (1%). However, the differences are an order

of magnitude smaller than the uncertainties, so that distributions can be considered equal.

the di-dimuon spectrum. A selection on the invariant mass of 2.9 < MJ/ψ < 3.3 GeV/c2 was applied on all dimuons
shown in order to enhance the J/ψ signal / background as much as possible.




   As a first approximation, it should therefore suffice to use the values obtained in the single J/ψ analysis,

which are A(J/ψ) = 0.2593 ± 0.0001(stat) ± 0.010(syst) [153]. The corresponding value of the di-J/ψ A is then

0.067 ± 0.005(syst), where the statistical uncertainty has been neglected and the relative systematic uncertainty

was computed as twice the relative systematic uncertainty on the single J/ψ A.

is not currently feasible with the spectrometer. Nonetheless, it is interesting to consider the sensitivity to non-prompt

contributions from decays of bb̄ pairs that hadronise into two B hadrons, which both decay into a J/ψ. In this section,

the influence of this process in the di-J/ψ measurement is studied.

   In order to determine the sensitivity of the measurement to the contamination of bb̄ pairs, simulations were done

using PYTHIA 6. For the simulations, three different input processes were used, each denoted by an arbitrary

internal name in ALICE:


   • kPyBeauty: Configuration which simulates 1 bb̄ pair per event, based on LO calculations.


   • kPyBeautyppMNR: This configuration is tuned to NLO computations [155], and instead of only bb̄ pairs, an

      entire pp event is simulated.


   • kPyBeautyppMNRwmi: the same as kPyBeautyppMNR but this configuration includes mechanisms for multi-

      parton interactions


   In the simulations, all B hadrons were forced to decay into J/ψ. For each of the three configurations, 50000

events, each containing at least one bb̄ pair were simulated. A number of events containing two bb̄ pairs (O(100)

per configuration) were observed. By counting the number of events in which two or more J/ψ enter the ALICE

spectrometer rapidity of 2.5 < y < 4.0, the probability of such events P (two or more J/ψ in 2.5 < y < 4.0) can be

computed. The contamination cross section can then be calculated as


                          σbALICE          tot                                           2
                             b̄→J/ψ+J/ψ = σbb̄ × P (two or more J/ψ in 2.5 < y < 4.0) × BB→J/ψ                       (6.5)


where σbtot
         b̄
            is the total bb̄ cross section, and BB→J/ψ the branching ratio of B hadrons to J/ψ. The total cross section

was determined in an LHCb measurement to be 495 ± 2(stat) ± 52(stat)µb [156], and the PDG branching ratio is

1.094 ± 0.032% [2]. P (two or more J/ψ in 2.5 < y < 4.0) was computed for each simulation configuration. The value

and systematic uncertainty of the probability were then computed as the average and standard deviation of the three

configurations, leading to P (two or more J/ψ in 2.5 < y < 4.0) = 3.2 ± 0.3(syst)%. With these numbers (neglecting

the statistical uncertainty on σbb̄ ), the cross section from J/ψ pairs originating from bb̄ pairs in the ALICE acceptance

is 1.9 ± 0.3 (syst) nb.

   It is also possible that from a bb̄ pair, only one J/ψ enters the spectrometer acceptance, along with a J/ψ formed

from a cc̄ pair. Contributions of this kind are assumed to be negligible in the analysis as they require a cc̄ pair in

addition to a bb̄ pair in the same event, both within the spectrometer acceptance.

6.7     Results

With the values obtained in the previous sections, the cross section computed with Eq. 6.1 yields a cross section

of 10.2 ± 2.3 (stat) ± 1.1 (syst) nb. The obtained cross section is inclusive, as no separation was made between

prompt and non-prompt contributions. This complicates the comparison with an LHCb measurement, also done
                   √
in pp collisions at s = 13 TeV, in which the non-prompt contributions were removed [99]. In the LHCb analysis,

the prompt di-J/ψ production cross section was measured to be 15.2 ± 1.0 (stat) ± 0.9 syst nb [99]. It should be

noted that the LHCb measurement was done for rapidity 2 < y < 4.5, while the ALICE measurement was done for

2.5 < y < 4.
                                                             dσ
   To compare the results, the differential cross sections   dy   were computed for both measurements. Additionally,

the contamination from bb̄ pairs estimated in Section 6.5 was subtracted from the ALICE cross section. The rapidity

differential cross sections are then 5.5 ± 1.5 (stat) ± 0.8 (syst) nb and 6.1 ± 0.4 (stat) ± 0.4 (syst) nb for the ALICE

and LHCb measurement respectively. Although the uncertainties on the ALICE value are larger, the measurements

agree well with each other.




6.8     Outlook

The measurement of di-J/ψ production demonstrates the feasibility of such measurements in ALICE. However, it is

clear that a larger integrated luminosity is necessary in order to derive meaningful conclusions on DPS contributions.

In December of 2018, the LHC Run-2 came to an end, and the accelerator was stopped. This period where no

collisions take place is called the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2), and it was devoted to the preparation of the LHC Run-

3. During LS2, each of the experiments planned upgrades to their detectors and the LHC accelerator itself was
                                                                                              √
upgraded as well. In LHC Run-3, the target integrated luminosity of ALICE for pp collisions at s = 13 TeV is

200 pb−1 [157]. This represents an increase of a factor 8 with respect to the current dataset. With the larger

integrated luminosity, it could become possible to perform the measurement differentially as a function of ∆pT or

∆y between the two J/ψ. The production cross section versus ∆y is important in order to separate SPS from DPS

contributions. Furthermore, with the ability to reconstruct J/ψ (through the electron decay channel) in the central

barrel, ALICE has the unique capability at the LHC to study simultaneous mid and forward J/ψ pair production. This

allows to probe large ∆y, where DPS contributions dominate.

   In preparation of LHC Run-3, the ALICE detector has been upgraded. A new detector called the Muon Forward

Tracker (MFT), has been installed, which was designed to improve the vertexing capabilities of the Muon Spectrom-

eter [158]. With the MFT it will be possible to separate prompt and non-prompt contributions, as the latter occur with

displaced vertices. As such, the prompt J/ψ pair production will be able to be measured directly, instead of through

corrections to the inclusive cross section.

Conclusions

The Quark-Gluon Plasma is a rich studying ground for properties of QCD under extreme conditions. In order to

recognize features of the QGP, it is necessary to have a firm grip on QCD phenomena that do not involve a hot and

dense medium. For example, parton distribution functions are known to be different in nuclei than in free protons

and neutrons, leading to nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). The nPDFs form the building blocks of

theoretical calculations involving hard processes, which are processes that occur with large momentum transfer. By

convoluting the parton distributions with the partonic cross sections, our understanding of QCD can be tested to a

high degree. While partonic cross sections for hard processes can be computed using perturbative QCD, the nPDFs

are non-perturbative objects and therefore cannot be determined from first principles. Instead, they are obtained

through global fits to data. Because Z bosons and their decay muons do not carry color charge, they do not interact

with the QGP formed in central Pb–Pb collisions and are therefore not sensitive to strong final state effects. Their

production can consequently be used to constrain nPDFs, which describe modifications to the initial state.
                                                                                               √
   In this thesis, the production of Z bosons in Pb–Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of sNN = 5.02 TeV was

measured. The Z bosons were reconstructed in their dimuon decay channels, with transverse momentum pT µ > 20

GeV/c, pseudorapidity 2.5 < η µ < 4.0, dimuon rapidity 2.5 < yµµ < 4.0 and dimuon invariant mass 60 < mµµ < 120

GeV/c2 . The invariant yield, normalised by the nuclear overlap function hTAA i was computed, as well as the nuclear

modification factor RAA , which quantifies deviations in production between AA and pp collisions. The normalised

invariant yield was determined integrated over rapidity and event centrality, and also as a function of each. The data

were compared with theoretical models, both those including nPDFs and those with free-nucleon PDFs. The data

show a clear and strong preference for nPDF calculations, which describe them well. In contrast, a 3.4 σ deviation

from the free-nucleon predictions was found in the integrated invariant yield. The observed deviation is larger than

the 2.3 σ deviation found in a previous ALICE publication on Z bosons, on a subset of the current data sample.

The yield as a function of rapidity shows an increasing preference for nPDF models as the rapidity grows. This is

attributed to the shadowing effect, which is more pronounced at forward rapidity where lower values of bjorken-x


                                                         113


are probed. The results obtained in ALICE are therefore complementary to those obtained in ATLAS and CMS,

where large bjorken-x are probed at midrapidity. Additionally, the data serve as a test of features of nPDFs such as

their universality. Lastly, the yield as a function of centrality can be used to test assumptions in the Glauber Monte

Carlo framework. The latter is used to determine event properties such as centrality, the number of binary collisons

hNcoll i, and the number of nucleons that undergo at least one scattering hNpart i. Z bosons can only be created in

the initial hard scatterings, so that their production should scale with hNcoll i. The normalised invariant yield should

therefore not depend on the centrality of the event. Within uncertainties, it was indeed found to be constant.

   Starting from LHC Run-3 in 2022, the readout of the ALICE detector will be improved to be able to handle a 50

kHz interaction rate in Pb–Pb collisions (it was 7.5 kHz in Run-2). The integrated luminosity in Run-3 and Run-4

combined will be roughly 10 times larger than the current Pb–Pb dataset. The higher integrated luminosity will

allow for measurements with much better precision than currently accessible, which in turn will lead to stronger

constraining power in the nPDF fits. In addition to collisions involving Pb–nuclei, heavy-ion data taking involving

oxygen nuclei are also programmed for Run-3. The interest in such runs in the context of nPDFs comes from the

fact that at high energy, most data in nPDF fits involve Pb–nuclei, as they come from the LHC. Due to a lack of

data from lighter ions at high energy, the dependence on the atomic mass A of nPDFs is not well understood.

Measurements of Z bosons in lighter ion collisions could therefore be valuable to constrain it. To estimate the

experimental feasibility of such measurements, projections were made for Z-boson production in p–O collisions
  √                                     √
at sNN = 9 TeV and O–O collisions at sNN = 6.37 TeV. With the expected luminosity, measurements in both

systems were found to be unfeasible. However, an increase in the allotted time for the oxygen runs could make

measurements attainable.

   In recent times, signs of collective behavior typically associated with the QGP have been observed in high-

multiplicity pp and pA collisions. The origin of this behavior is not yet well understood. One possible explanation is

the formation of small QGP droplets. Another potential origin for the observed collectivity are multi-parton interac-

tions (MPI). Such MPI could be indirectly observed in the production of J/ψ pairs, which contain contributions from

single parton scatterings as well as multiple parton scatterings. In particular, double parton contributions (DPS) are

expected to be non-negligible at LHC energies. J/ψ pair production is also useful to understand single J/ψ produc-

tion, where current measurements and calculations of differential cross sections and polarisation prevent conclusive

statements regarding dominant production modes. Associated quarkonium production such as J/ψ pair production

are considered promising tools to disentangle the various single J/ψ production models.
                                                                                √
   In this thesis, a measurement of the di-J/ψ cross section in pp collisions at sNN = 13 TeV was presented. The

analysis was done on a data sample with an integrated luminosity of L = 24.38 ± 0.01 (stat) ± 0.87 (syst)pb−1 . The

J/ψ were reconstructed in their dimuon decay channels, with dimuon rapidity 2.5 < yµµ < 4.0. At the moment,

the Muon Spectrometer does not allow for a separation between prompt and non-prompt contributions, so that the

inclusive cross section was measured to be 10.2 ± 2.3 (stat) ± 1.1 (syst) nb. By estimating non-prompt contributions

obtained. This result is in good agreement with the value of    dy   = 6.1 ± 0.4 (stat) ± 0.4 (syst) found in LHCb. This is

the first time that the inclusive di-J/ψ cross section has been measured in ALICE.

   Thanks to the addition of the Muon Forward tracker in Run-3, it will be possible to directly measure the prompt di-

J/ψ production. Moreover, the integrated luminosity of pp collisions is expected to increase by a factor of 8, which will

allow for a measurement with much better experimental precision. With the increased luminosity, the cross section

as a function of the rapidity difference between the two J/ψ can then be measured. This will help to distinguish SPS

from DPS contributions, as the latter are expected to dominate at large ∆y.
