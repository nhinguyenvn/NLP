Energy Harvesters (EH) became one of the most attractive technologies in science and
engineering thanks to its significant role in saving energy. One famous application of this
system is its use to power Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS). Depsite there is
a huge quantity of kinetic energy in rotating car’s wheels, the fact that rotations of the
wheel induce a high level of centrifugal forces presents a major drawback that deprive the
harvesting of this type of energy.
   In this thesis, a kinetic energy harvester is designed, modeled and fabricated. Different
designs of multi-pendulum system which are known to be easily unstable are modeled
and putted under experiment. The harvested energy is also compared between different
designs for the steady-state and the transient responses.
Mainly, two new researches challenges are present in this case of study comparing to
exicting studies. First, the fact that the pendulum is implemented into the car’s wheel
induce a rotative excitation which is composition of a horizontal and a vertical excitations
at the same time. Second, as we look for maximizing the harvested energy, our interest is
presented not only to steady-state response but also to transient response.
   The proof of concept on the use of pendulum-based energy harvester rotating wheels
is tackled, considering a simple concentrated mass designs to analyze the motion and the
possibility to harvest energy from rotating wheels with variable speeds. The equations of
motion of four designs considered in transient behvior, are presented and derived. The
time response of the angular position and angular velocity were calculated for different
damping coefficients and initial conditions. The RMS value of the angular velocity used
to estimate the harvested energy depends on the initial conditions.
   A test bench is also setted up to reproduce the behavior of the pendulum mounted
into a rotating disk. The solution for the steady-state behavior of three pendulum designs,
generated at angular velocity for different rotation speeds, is experimentally tested. Three
different regimes exists: oscillations around the vertical axis, aperiodic oscillations and
oscillations around the radial axis. The aperiodic regime gives better output voltage for

each pendulum. Then, a half-sine input function is used to record the transient output
voltage generated for different initial positions of the disk for each pendulum.
     An analytical analysis is proposed to analyze the steady-state response under constant
rotation speeds, because it represents a non negligible part of the regime of motion of the
wheels. The method of multiple scales is applied for the equations of motion governing
the motion of the Rott’s pendulum when small oscillations are assumed around the radial
positions. For the two proposed sets of geometrical dimensions, parametric resonance of
the first and second modes while two to one internal resonance is satisfied can be achieved.
In both cases, the analytically derived resonance conditions, shows that large amplitude of
motions can be achieved if a critical value of the rotation speed is reached. However, if the
speed is further increase the amplitude is again highly reduced. In fact, the treated case is
specific to the TPMS case because the rotation speed in this case is at the same time the
frequency excitation force and the amplitude of the stabilizing force represented here by
the centrifugal force.
     Keywords: energy harvesting, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), Rott’s
pendulum, multiple scales, pertubation technique, nonlinear dynamic.

Les systèmes de récolte d’énergie sont devenus l’une des technologies les plus attrayantes
grâce à leurs rôles de plus en plus importants dans la sauvegarde de l’énergie et de
l’environnement. Une application souhaitée de ces systèmes est leur utilisation pour
alimenter les systèmes de surveillance de la pression des pneus (TPMS). En effet, une
grande quantité d’énergie cinétique due à la rotation des roues de voitures peut être
exploitée par les récupérateurs d’énergie. Néanmoins, les forces centrifuges induites
présentent un inconvénient majeur qui limite la récupération d’énergie.
   Dans cette thèse, un récupérateur d’énergie cinétique est conçu, modélisé et fabriqué.
Différents designs de systèmes à pendules multiples, connus pour être facilement instables,
sont modélisés et mis à l’essai. L’énergie récoltée est également comparée entre différentes
conceptions pour les réponses stables et transitoires.
   Principalement, deux nouveaux défis sont traités dans le cadre de cette thèse.
Premièrement, le fait que le pendule soit lié à la roue induit une excitation rotative
particulièrement complexe. Deuxièmement, lorsque nous cherchons à maximiser l’énergie
récoltée, notre intérêt se porte non seulement sur la réponse en régime permanent, mais
également sur la réponse transitoire.
   Un banc d’essai est également installé pour reproduire le comportement du pendule
monté sur un disque rotatif. La solution pour le comportement en régime permanent de
trois conceptions de pendules, générées à une vitesse angulaire pour différentes vitesses
de rotation, est testée expérimentalement. Trois régimes différents existent: oscillations
autour de l’axe vertical, oscillations apériodiques et oscillations autour de l’axe radial. Le
régime apériodique donne une meilleure quantité d’énergie pour chaque pendule. Ensuite,
une fonction d’entrée demi-sinusoïdale est utilisée pour enregistrer l’énergie en régime
transitoire générée pour différentes positions initiales du disque pour chaque pendule.
   Une analyse analytique est proposée pour analyser la réponse en régime permanent
à des vitesses de rotation constantes, car elle représente une partie non négligeable du
régime de mouvement des roues. La méthode des échelles multiples est appliquée aux

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATIONS

Saving energy is with no doubt, one of the most important interests of researchers in this
century. Indeed, many types of energy are present in the environment, all over the world,
but the most important issue stills to be how to convert ambient energy into electrical
power? A question which is in the origin of all research areas known as renewable
energy and energy harvesting. The first one depends on large-scale power generation,
for example, solar or wind power, and is concerned with megawatts of power generation.
While the energy harvesting typically refers to power in the order of milli to micro-watts.
   Now-days, to monitor different systems, more and more complex and networked,
sensors become omnipresent, powered generally by button-batteries.               This conduct
researches to look for developed energy harvesters that can scavenge energy from the
surrounding environment. A famous application of such system is the energy harvester
for Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS). Different energy harvesters were designed
acting as transducers from sources of energy, such as vibrations, pressure, tire deformation,
gravity... using piezoelectric, electrostatic, or electromagnetic transducers.
   Nevertheless, the kinetic energy, which is present with high level in rotating car’s
wheels, has been roughly investigated. The fact that rotations of the wheel induce a high
level of centrifugal forces, acting as a uni-direction static force is a major drawback for
this particular energy harvesting design.
   In this thesis, we aim to design, model and fabricate a kinetic energy harvester that
can be efficient even in the previously mentioned conditions. The idea is to model and
put under experiment different designs of multi-pendulum system which are known to be
easily unstable, then, to compare the harvested energy, between different designs for the
steady-state and the transient responses.
   Many research works are presents in the literature for different kind of pendulums.
However, in our case of study the pendulum will be implemented into the car’s wheel,

therefore it presents new research challenges. Indeed, the excitation in our case is a
rotative excitation which can be considered as a composition of a horizontal and a vertical
excitations at the same time. In the other hand, the interest that has been presented
by researchers in the literature, was in the study of the steady-state response of excited
pendulums. In our case, even the transient response could be an interesting track of study
as long as the harvested energy is maximized.



T HESIS ORGANIZATION

The dissertation is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, we present a general overview of the
energy harvesting technology and in particular its application for TPMS. The technology
used to harvest energy from rotating wheel to feed the TPMS device depends on the way
in which the energy harvester is mounted; on the rim or on the tire. The energy harvesting
was also investigated in different rotating systems using different technologies such as
simple pendulums in self-winding watches. The pendulum theories for simple, double and
rotating pendulums is also presented in order to link with the general methodology and
framework in this thesis work.
     Chapter 2 tackle the proof of concept on the use of pendulum-based energy harvester
rotating wheels. Considering a simple concentrated mass designs to analyze the motion
and the possibility to harvest energy from rotating wheels with variable speeds. The
number of degree of freedom to be considered in these designs can vary. However, except
the first degree which is restricted to the rotation of the wheel, for convenience the second
one should carry the transducer. We start by presenting and deriving equations of motion of
four designs that are taken into consideration in the transient behavior : Simple pendulum
with parallel axis, double pendulum with parallel axes, simple pendulum with non-parallel
axis and Rott’s pendulum. In the second part of this chapter we compare different designs
in the time domain. Starting by calculating the time response and the RMS value of the
angular velocity for each design.
     Chapter 3 puts into experiment three pendulum designs: simple pendulum, double
pendulum and Rott’s pendulum. Starting by characterizing the electromagnetic generator
in which the pendulums will be linked. As a first step, we derive the governing equation
of the generator to get the torque developed at the generator’s shaft and the generated
power. Then we look at the optimum load resistance by measuring the higher power from
generated voltage and current. Then, we will proceed to the setup and characterization
of each pendulum. We use a test bench setup to reproduce the behavior of the pendulum

mounted into a rotating disk. Steady-state and transient behaviors will be tested and the
output voltage will be measured at each case.
   In Chapter 4, an analytical approach is proposed to analyze the behavior of a specific
pendulum, namely the Rott’s design linked to a rotating wheel, in the steady-state regime.
The perturbation technique is used in order to clarify the contribution of the different
geometrical and physical parameters on the steady-state response of the Rott’s pendulum
under constant rotation speed.
   The thesis is terminated by a general conclusion and an insight for future works.

1.1    T IRE P RESSURE M ONITORING S YSTEM

Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) refers to a device that monitors the internal
pressure of tires for wheeled vehicles, and offers this information to the driver
instantaneously in the dashboard of the vehicle [1]. Since the wheels are rotating with
respect to the body of the vehicle, the TPMS is a wireless device that communicates the
pressure information wirelessly after beeing measured inside the tire.
   Using TPMS has several advantages:

    • A reduction in fuel consumption : in fact for a percentage equivalent to 10% under-
      inflation on each tire of a given vehicle, results in a 1% reduction in fuel economy
      [2].

    • Extend the life of tires: under-inflation is the main cause of tire wear failure. Indeed,
      under-inflation destroys the structure of the tire and increases the number of turns
      due to the decrease in its diameter. This reduces tire recycling possibilities such as
      retreading [3].

    • Reduced downtime and maintenance: due to failures due to under-inflation, valuable
      downtime is required for maintenance. Indeed, tires naturally lose about 10% of
      their initial pressure.

    • Improved safety: a well-inflated tire offers greater stability and maneuverability
      for the vehicle and allows better braking. In France, the road safety organization
      estimates that 9% of fatal road accidents are due to under-inflation. In Germany

        DEKRA, a product safety organization, estimated that 41% of accidents with
        physical injuries are related to tire problems. In numbers, under-inflated tires causes
        40,000 accidents, 33,000 injuries and over 650 deaths per year.



     • Reduced Emissions: according to US Department of Transportation estimates,
        under-inflation of tires causes more than 26 million tonnes of carbon monoxide to
        be released into the atmosphere each year in the United States alone. EU reports
        indicate that an average under-inflation of 40 kPa produces a 2% increase in fuel
        consumption and a 25% reduction in tire life. The EU concludes that under-inflation
        of tires is now responsible for more than 20 million liters of fuel burnt unnecessarily,
        more than 2 million tonnes of CO2 released into the atmosphere, and 200 million
        tires prematurely wasted in the world.




1.1.1     M EASUREMENT APPROACHES IN TPMS


The first TPMS is reported in a patent by McDonell [4]. The author of the patent used
a complex wired system to monitor the pressure inside the tire. Several other systems
were proposed in the following years either by particular inventor or tire manufacturing
companies. Mainly, there are two types of technologies for TPMS: direct and indirect
approaches.
     Indirect approach operates in relation to the anti-lock braking system (ABS) [5]. In
fact, measurement of small changes in wheel speed due to the reduction in its radius
following a loss of pressure can be used to detect inflated tires. This approach can only
detect variation of the pressure and cannot give an information about its specific value [6].
However, this technology does not require any additional installation on the wheel [7].
Other indirect approaches are based on analyzing the natural frequencies of the tire, which
is strongly related to its internal pressure [5].
     On the other hand, direct technology, measures directly the pressure on the wheel and
can provides additional information, such as temperature and accelerations. However, it
requires the installation of an energy source on each wheel such as batteries. The device is
generally linked to the tire’s valve, so that the pressure sensor can measure the differential
pressure. An example of a direct approach TPMS is shown in Figure 1.1.

     Figure 1.1: Tire Pressure Monitoring System using a direct approach measurement [5].


   The direct approach is therefore the one which is more widespread for TPMS systems
thanks to its measurement accuracy and its ability to adapt to future technologies of
intelligent tires. However, energy requirement limit the lifespan of the device to only 7
to 10 years because of the use of battery [5]. Also, in case of battery replacement, the
whole device should be replaced to avoid calibration problems. This fact highly increase
maintenance coasts. The TPMS device is composed of following main components that
are mounted to the valve stem inside the tire:

    • pressure sensor;

    • analog-digital converter;

    • microcontroller;

    • system controller;

    • oscillator;

    • radio frequency transmitter;

    • low frequency receiver, and

    • voltage regulator (battery management).

   There are two possible types of installations for direct approach TPMS device: internal
or external. In the case of an internal installation the system is attached to the rim . For
external installation it usually replaces the plug of the inflation valve.

1.1.2     TPMS L EGISLATIVE F RAMEWORK

In 2000, the US Congress passed the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability
and Documentation (or TREAD) Act, a federal law that intends to increase consumer
safety through mandates assigned to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) [8]. TREAD requires that starting from year 2007, all vehicles sold in the United
States (15 million each year) should include a TPMS.
     In Europe, Regulation No 661/2009 of the European Parliament requires the adaptation
of a TPMS module on all passenger vehicles over the period 2012-2014 [9]. The level of
detection required by this law is 20%. In a second phase, after 2014, this level will be
postponed to 15%.


1.1.3     L IMITS & P OSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS OF TPMS

All TPMS require an internal source of energy for their operation. Energy is mainly
required for pressure and temperature measurements and for data transmission to the
driver’s display unit. This source is currently provided by batteries whose lifetime does
not exceed 7 years [5], which requires additional maintenance. Even when using sampling
measurement and transmission method, allowing tire pressure to be read every few seconds
[6]. In addition, these systems allow data to be updated only when the vehicle exceeds 30
km/h.
     Existing TPMS solutions present two major drawbacks today:

     • The non-integration of the different technologies used: this presents a risk of high
        failure and a considerable additional cost at the manufacturing level. Integration
        also ensures the durability and reliability of the system.

     • The presence of a battery for the operation of the system: it presents a not negligible
        safety risk in the event of simultaneously depletion and loss of pressure. In addition,
        car manufacturers recommend only between 7 and 10 years of battery life. It should
        be noted that the replacement of these millions of batteries presents a considerable
        danger to the environment, which is also not negligible.

     Therefore, there is significant interest in replacing the battery in TPMS modules with
an autonomous energy source such as energy harvesting systems. Figure 1.2 shows the
TPMS block diagram which consists of a set of components: a system of measurement of
pressure, temperature, motion ... which sends data to an analog-to-digital converter. Then
a controller collects and processes them. Then, these data are transmitted by RF waves

module. It allows the conversion of the mechanical energy, due to the vibration and/or
rotation of the wheel, into electrical energy which will be temporarily stored to feed the

Energy harvesting technology has been developed after the proliferation of "autonomous
wireless electronic systems". Wireless sensor networks (WSN), a combination of wireless
sensor nodes, with data processing and communication capabilities, are the classical
example of such systems [10]. Recentely, the use Internet of Things (IoT) [11] concept,
which is also a WSN with internet communication capabilities, attracted the attentions
of the IT (Information Technology) community because of its high integration potential.
As the number of nodes tend to increase especially for IoT application, the integration of
energy harvesters from the envirnement is an attractive solution to replace or increase life

1.2.1    W IRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS

First WSN were used in military applications for battlefield surveillance [13]. After
that they were used for monitoring and control in different fields [14] such as health
care monitoring, industry (machine and structural health monitoring, data logging ...),
environment and earth sensing (air pollution monitoring, natural disaster prevention...),
pipeline monitoring ...
     A WSN is composed of autonomous wireless sensors distributed in a specific area to
monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as sound, pressure, temperature, etc.,
then they transfer their data trough the network to a centralized processing station.
     A sensor node has not only the task to collect data, but also to locally analyze, correlate,
and fuse its own sensor data and data from other sensor nodes. Sensor nodes communicate
not only with each other but also with a base station using their wireless radios, allowing
them to disseminate their sensor data to remote processing, visualization, analysis, and
storage systems. For example, Figure 1.3, presented by Dargie and Poellabauer [15],
shows two sensor fields monitoring two different geographic regions and connecting to
the Internet using their base stations.




                            Figure 1.3: Wireless Sensor Networks [15]


     Therefore, in a WSN, hundreds or even thousands of sensor nodes are connected
between them to monitor a large physical environment. Each sensor node comprises a
sensor, processing electronics, wireless communications, and power supply.
     Internet of Things is foreseen to be a world-wide network of interconnected objects

uniquely addressable, based on standard communication protocols. In IoT any object,
such as computers, sensors, RFID tags or mobile phones, is identified by a unique address,
and will be able to dynamically join the Internet, collaborate and cooperate efficiently to
achieve different tasks [16].
   Since sensor nodes of a WSN are by definition wireless and cannot be plugged into
a main supply, power has to be provided locally. Thus, typically such a local power
supply is provided a battery. However, batteries contain a finite supply of energy and
require periodic replacement or recharging. This may be fine in individual deployments
but across a wireless network containing a multitude of nodes batteries are clearly not
attractive. Furthermore, the need to replace batteries means the wireless system has to be
accessible which may not be possible or may compromise performance. Finally, there are
environmental concerns about disposing of batteries. Energy harvesting was developed,
therefore, as a method for replacing or augmenting batteries.
   In many cases, it is not possible to supply a sensor network, containing hundreds or
thousands of sensors, by means of batteries. Indeed, the short life of batteries compared to
the life of the sensor, requires a periodic replacement. Furthermore, the wireless system is
not always accessible. Thus, the replacement of batteries may be not advisable, dangerous,
too expensive or impossible. In addition, there are environmental concerns about disposing
of batteries. In these situations, one possible solution is the use of an energy harvester, a
device designed to collect energy from a source available in the environment, to provide
the required electrical power during the lifetime of the wireless system, letting it free to
be placed wherever. Energy Harvesting seems to be a very good alternative since energy
is present everywhere in the environment. So we can scavenge energy from the nature
(wind, water, sun) or from smart materials (piezoelectric, Electro active polymers... ) or
even from active systems (kinetic, vibrations, thermal, electromagnetic radiation...)

Nowadays, energy harvesting is a research area by itself, composed of different fields,
depending on the source of energy and the transduction technology.
   In Table 1.1 we give a comparison of extracted power density using these technologies.
Except for solar energy generation, which requires permanent outdoor solar panels, the
approach based on harvesting ambient vibration energy exhibits the most promising
technology for universal use. Thus, in this work, we will focus on one specific energy
harvester which is the Kinetic energy harvester.

     Kinetic energy harvester transduces movements or vibrations into electrical energy.
The first kinetic energy harvester was developed by [18]. It is typically composed of a a
spring-mass system. When the generator vibrates, a relative movement is created between
the mass and the housing. The sinusoidal displacement drives a transducer to generate
electrical energy.
     Many challenges face designers of kinetic energy harvesters. First, to choose the most
suitable transducer that can give better power density and very low power electronics.
Energy harvesting faces technological challenges for overcoming difficulties related to
size dependency of the produced power. Furthermore, most of ambient vibration-energy
harvesters are efficient only within a limited range of vibration frequencies. Depending on
these characteristics, three basic vibration-to-electric energy conversion mechanisms are
mainly utilized: electromagnetic, electrostatic and piezoelectric transductions.

Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Energy harvesting using piezoelectric transduction
relies on the vibration of structures. A piezoelectric material has the ability to convert
mechanical strain to electrical polarization, and vice versa. Piezoelectric phenomena are
found in crystal materials which do not have a symmetry center regarding the positive and
negative charges. Therefore, creating an electrical polarization within the crystal material.
Several configurations have been used in the literature with monomorph [19] and bimorph
[20] configurations into cantilever beams. To increase the inertia of the oscillator and
reduce its fundamental natural frequency, a tip mass is sometimes added.

Electrostatic Energy Harvesting Electrostatic energy harvesters are micro-machined
devices including variable capacitance by moving one of the electrodes with respect to
the other one, using mechanical vibration from the environment. The system converts

mechanical energy into electrical one by using two basic mechanisms: voltage-constrained
and charge-constrained approaches. In both cases a suitable electric conditioning circuit
should be addressed in addition to a voltage source that charges the variable capacitor at its
lower position [21]. Also, electret based material could be used to eliminate the voltage or
charge source [22]. The same concept was used by [23] to convert kinetic energy using a
dielectric elastomer material. The material is disposed into membranes where the faces are
covered by compliant electrodes. The small variation of the thickness is used as a variable
capacitor [24]. Variable capacitor are particularly suitable for miniaturization especially
using MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) technology.


Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting depends on
the Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction : when an electric conductor is moved
through a magnetic field, a potential difference is induced between the ends of the
conductor. The circuit consists of a coil of wire of multiple turns and the magnetic field is
created by permanent magnets [25, 26]. These transducers generates high power densities,
however they are difficult to miniaturize because of the presence of the coil.



1.3     E NERGY HARVESTING IN TPMS

In the literature, the fact that these systems are installed in the wheels, led the researchers to
use different sources of motion and deformations to be converted into electrical energy. For
example, tire deformations, variation of the radial acceleration due to wheel contact with
the ground, vibrations due to unbalanced masses, pressure variations, rotation ... These
different excitations define the way in which the energy harvester is mounted. Therefore,
two kinds of mountings exists: to the tire or to the rim.


1.3.1   E NERGY HARVESTER FIXED TO THE TIRE

The contact of the tire with the ground generates displacements that are periodic due to
the rotation of the wheel. In fact, the contact area can be represented as a plat surface
that change locally the radius of the tire. Two effects can be extracted from this radius
variation: (i) The local deformation of the tire at the contact surface, and (ii) The variation
of the radial acceleration for a material point located at the tire, at the beginning and the
end of the contact zone. In Figure 1.4, Bowen and Arafa [27] shows the variation of
circumferential strain and radial acceleration in a tire rolling on a hard surface. Bowen

and Arafa [27] reported that a peak acceleration of 100g can be measured at 60km/h and
that the corresponding deformation can reach 4000µε. Also Tornincasa et al. [28] showed
that 180g can be measured for a tire with 60km/h speed, the time response of the radial
acceleration for different speeds of the vehicle are shown in Figure 1.5.

as piezoelectric patches that are directly attached to the tire [29]. Several solutions were
proposed in the literature using this concept. In general the harvester is attached to the

internal side of the tire and deforms when the tire comes into contact with the ground. The
idea have been the subject of several patents. For example, Mancosu et al. [30] proposed
a device in form of a piezoelectric wire fixed into the circumferential internal side the tire
(Figure 1.6). Adamson and O’brien [31] and Lee et al. [32] designed an energy harvester
with a AFC patch, i.e. piezoelectric fiber material embedded into an epoxy matrix and
using interdigitated electrodes as shown in Figure 1.7 for to the device proposed in [31].
The AFC patch is mounted on a support substrate that helps distribute mechanical strain
to which the piezoelectric fibers are subjected in a substantially uniform way. The AFC
structure is mounted within the tire structure such that electric charge is generated when
the wheel assembly moves along a ground surface. Electrodes are coupled to a power
conditioning module that rectifies the resultant electric current and stores it in an energy
storage device, such as electrolytic capacitors [31].

mounted on a ribbon bonded to the bead of the tire. In the same paper Makki and Pop-Iliev
[34] used a piezoelectric PZT material patch that was directly bonded to the tire. A special
high temperature adhesive was used to allow the patch to deform with the tire without
damaging the PZT ceramic layer from high strain. Makki and Pop-Iliev [34] showed that
936µW/cm2 of power density can be achieved. The PZT based design was shown to be the
most efficient thanks to the high piezoelectric coupling coefficient of the PZT compared
to PVDF. Since the deformation of the tire is directly proportional to the voltage generated
by the piezoelectric patch, some researchers thought of using this information to monitor
the tire conditions. The concept is known as intelligent or smart tire [35].


Concepts based on the variation of the radial acceleration of the tire : The variation
of the radial acceleration of tire due to several causes can generate vibrations of the tire.
These vibration can be harvested and converted into electrical energy. A large broadband
frequencies are concerned with vibration, however they are centered around 100 Hz [36,
37].
     In order to convert vibration into electrical energy, piezoelectric materials are also used
here. However, an inertial mass attached to an elastic component should be added in order
to activate the piezoelectric patch. A two-layer piezoelectric bender (bimorph) mounted as
a cantilever beam is used by [38, 39, 40]. Others used a monomorph piezoelectric material
as a cantilever beam and a mass attached to its free end [41]. Both designs were attached
to the tire. In addition to the cantilever design, [42] added limit stoppers to increase the
bandwidth frequency response of the harvester (Figure 1.8).

70 km/h a mean value of 42µW was observed [43]. Renaud et al. [46] reported improved
reliability of similar MEMS energy harvester subject to high shock (1700 g) using stoppers
to limit the cantilever beam displacement.
   Electromagnetic transducers were also used for energy harvesters attached to the tire.
Tornincasa et al. [28] designed a device (Figure1.9) consisting of a floating permanent
magnet which slides in a guide around which, two coils connected in series are wrapped
in the opposite direction so that their electromotive force is added. A permanent magnet
is placed in the lower part to push the floating magnet to the upper part. The displacement
of the floating magnet in the guide caused by the variation of the radial acceleration of the
tire, changes the coupling of flux of the coils and produces an electromotive force.
   Vibration induced in the tire are highly depending on the quality of the road and the
driving style, as a result the energy harvester can be hardly tuned to cover the entire
bandwidth of the frequency spectrum where energy can be extracted [29]. Therefore,
researcher tried to design their device according to the more abandant frequency in the
spectrum.

Fixing the EH on the rim seems to be a more practical solution. Indeed, it shows a better
stability, a less rolling noise, and a simple process for tire exchange. According to Chicone
and Feng [47], with a constant angular velocity of the rotating wheel, it’s very difficult to
extract energy from rotating rim.

piezoelectric membrane. This system presents some limits since the efficiency of the
device strongly depends on many environmental parameters such as temperature inside
tire and vehicle speed.


Concepts based on the vibration of the rim : The principle of piezoelectric cantilever-
mass system have been also used as a solution for vibration energy harvesters fixed
on the rim. The idea was presented in several contribution and patents with different
configurations. Huang et al. [49] designed a vibration energy harvester fixed on the rim,
made of a cantilever beam with a single monomorph piezoelectric patch and a mass placed
on its free end. With a similar design Mak et al. [50] considered a bimorph configuration
using a PZT material. A tip mass was used to reduce the natural frequency of the harvester.
Also limit stoppers were used to restrict the maximum displacement, and avoid damage
of the piezoceramic. Zheng et al. [51] and Kubba and Jiang [52] designed an asymmetric
air-spaced cantilever beam. The idea is to increase the output voltage by increasing
the distance between the piezoelectric layer and the neutral axis. The mechanical-to-
electrical energy conversion efficiency is improved because air-spaced cantilevers enable
the majority of the strain energy to stretch that activates the piezoelectric layer. The design
of Zheng and Xu [51] is shown in Figure 1.10.

Concepts based on the rotation of the wheel and the gravitational forces : To
overcome the limitation deduced by Chicone and Feng [47] for the difficulty to harvest
energy when a constant speed of the vehicle is imposed. In fact, at constant speed all forces
on the rim are constants if we neglect the effect of external vibration. Therefore classical
design cannot be used to extract energy. Some researchers thought about including the
effect of the gravity that can be regarded as a periodic force from the rim point of view.
     [53] designed an energy harvester made of two beams, a piezoelectric generating beam
and a flexible driving beam with a mass mounted at the free end (Figure 1.11). As the

system is rotating the variable applied force due to gravity on the flexible beam is used
to actuate the piezoelectric beam by periodic shocks each rotation of the system. Gu and
Livermore [53] also took advantage of the centrifugal force to tune the natural frequency
of the flexible beam so that it follows the rotation frequency when a specific mounting
radium is imposed.




                      Figure 1.11: Rigid/flexible beams EH system [53].


   The same concept can be used with rotating harvesters such as pendulums and take
advantage of the periodicity of the gravity to generate electrical power. But, the centrifugal
acceleration can largely reduce the effect of the gravity because it imposes a large radial
force which tend to cancel the periodic effect of the gravity. In addition, since the
centrifugal force is proportional to the square of the rotation speed it can quickly cancel
the gravity and force the pendulum to keep a radial quasistatic position that is not suitable
to generate energy.
   To get around this issue Wang et al. [54] in 2010, proposed a single degree of freedom
pendulum where three magnets have been attached to the rotating part of the pendulum
at different angular position. Two coils are attached to the rotating disk supporting the
pendulum. As the rotation speed is increased, the magnets activates the coils by inducing
an electrical current. The design have been tested analytically, using a point mass system,
and experimentally. They proved that the design can harvest several mW of power from the
rotation of the wheel [54]. In 2012, the same authors improved their design by replacing
the three magnet system by a Halbach array magnetic disk shown in Figure 1.12 [55].
They showed that the electromechanical coupling coefficient is higher for the Halbach
array when compared to a multipolar magnetic disk. However, the output power was only
around 550 µW for a rotation speed of the disk at 500 rpm (60 km/h). The new design
was also tested experimentally both in an experimental setup [56] and mounted into a real
car’s wheel [57].
   Lee at al. [58] proposed also simple pendulum which can directly rotate an electric
generator. A single magnet is placed toward the equilibrium position of the swinging mass

track. The design was testes experimentally with a TPMS system mounted into the rim
of a vehicle for road test. The output power of 10 µW was enough to feed the TPMS and
transmit data each 78 s at 10 km/h.

1.4      E NERGY HARVESTING IN ROTATING SYSTEMS

Rotating systems are one of the most used systems in industrial environment due to the
use of rotating motors such as electric motors and combustion and thermal engines. The
rotating parts develops high kinetic energy thanks to their large inertia and rotating speed.
On the other hand, they are generally balanced so that the rotating masses do not generate
large vibrations to avoid premature failure due to fatigue problems. Therefore, classical
designs that uses mechanical oscillation to harvest the kinetic energy, are not suitable in
this case especially because they are optimized for a single frequency while the rotating
systems have a large bandwidth frequencies correlated to the rotation speed. Several
research groups proposed specific designs to harvest kinetic energy from rotating systems.

transient behavior of the beam while the rotation speed is varied. They stated that their
system cannot harvest energy if the speed is constant and the steady state behavior of the
beam is reached.

     In a series of papers Toh et al. designed what they presented as a gravitational torque
generator [60, 61, 62, 63, 64]. A DC motor was used as generator, its rotor was assembled
to a rotating shaft and the stator unbalanced by a large inertial mass. They showed that the
effect of gravity can be used to keep the stator’s generator fixed with respect to the gravity
(Figure 1.15). They showed they a very high power output can be reached (around 1 W at
8000 rpm) if the generator is mounted at the axis of rotation. The power output drops to
10 mW at 500 rpm if the generator is mounted off-axis.

1.4.2.1   S ELF WINDING WATCHES

Historically pendulums have been used as a main component for self-winding watches
since 1773 [70]. The main idea is to place an unbalanced mass (part of a rigid disk)
in order to replace the rotation of the knob each time the user wants to wind the spiral
mainspring of a portable watch (Figure 1.17). The motion of the unbalanced mass is
generated by the motion of the wearer’s hand (wrist watches or pocket watches). At the
beginning the concept was purely mechanical, however, several other systems proposed
the use of the initial rotation of the mass to generate electrical energy so that it can be
used to feed classical watch mechanisms such as those using a quartz tuning fork system.
The energy is generated by linking the generated inertial motion to a gear train in order
to increase the mechanical couple applied to a microgenerator (Figure 1.18 [71]). The
output voltage is rectified and stored into a capacitor. Other more complex mechanism
have been proposed such as the one using gyroscopic forces with a rotating disk having
two perpendicular rotation axis proposed by Yeatman et al. [72].

1.4.2.2   P ENDULUM IN EH SYSTEMS

Design using the concept of pendulum has been widely used in the literature either as a
free rotating mass or when the inertial mass is elastically attached to other components like
springs or beams. Lu e al. [73] proposed the use of a semicircular disk as a single degree
of freedom pendulum. The pendulum is attached to an elastic component and the total
system is subject to base excitation. as a result, the pendulum is parametrically excited
so that the generated motion of the mass can rotate a generator. Chao et al [74] continue
this analysis by linking the motion of the mass to a previously designed electromagnetic
microgenerator by Liao et al. [75]. The experiments conducted by Chao et al [74] showed
that, using a specially designed conditioning circuit, the system successfully converted the
mechanical energy into DC voltage directly usable in microelectronic environment.
     Najdecka [76] proposed a similar system with two springs connected to the inertial
mass in two different direction. The developed system was intended to be used in sea
wave energy harvesting. Different excitation conditions have been tested with the design
including stochastic signals. for a large pendulum carrying a 0.7 kg inertial mass and
at 2.5 Hz harmonic excitation, the system was able to harvest 50 W. Similarly, with a 3
rigidly connected rod forming a large single pendulum, Yurchenko et al. [77] increased
the moment of inertia of the pendulum and fixed the system into an inclined ramp excited
by the waves.

connected to a electromagnetic generator, the device showed that up to 10 mW can

the a large magnet moving in front of a coil. The lever beam amplifies the motion of the
pendulum and induces more harvested power.
   A single pendulum with a quarter of disk shape and carrying several magnets is

that with harmonic base excitation, rotating solution of the pendulum can be observed

It is difficult to imagine simpler than a pendulum as single degree of freedom oscillator.
And yet, in spite of this simplicity, the pendulum has played a great role in the development
of science. In the seventeenth century, he was used by Galileo to confirm the law of falling
bodies and Newton to illustrate his laws of dynamics [81]. In the nineteenth century it
was used by Leon Foucault to provide the first experimental evidence of the rotation of the
Earth on itself [82].
   The simpler version of a pendulum is a point mass suspended from a pivot so that it can
swing freely. It is an oscillating system which, moved away from its resting equilibrium
position, returns there by describing oscillations, under the effect of a restoring force, for
example the weight of the mass.
   We present here the general equation of motion of a simple pendulum represented by a
point mass suspended by a rigid massless rod, shown in Figure 1.19. For small amplitudes
of motion, the approximation sinθ ≈ θ [83] can be taken into account, we end up

     The time for one complete cycle, is called the period T . For small amplitudes, T
depends on the length of the string of the pendulum L and the acceleration of gravity g. It
can be approximated by the following equation :

As shown in Equation (1.2), the period, and therefore the natural frequency, does not
depend on the inertia of the suspended mass.
     If damping is taken into account the periodic amplitude gradually diminishes, the
pendulum will come to rest. Different causes can induce the loss of energy in a mechanical
system, such as friction between solid surfaces and drag on the system from fluids and
gases. At high speeds, objects moving through the atmosphere experience a drag force
that is proportional to the square of the velocity. For slower objects, the drag force may be
considered as proportional to the first power of the velocity.
     To let a pendulum oscillate continuously, some kind of forcing must be applied to
provide an energy infusion that compensates for the energy loss caused by the damping,
such as sinusoidal forcing, pulsed forcing, and parametric forcing.
     Let us take the case of a pendulum of a particle of mass m attached to one end of a
massless rod of length l, whose support is under the influence of prescribed acceleration
as shown in Figure1.19.

   Equation 1.6 is a Mathieu equation [85] which defines the response as a parametric
oscillator. Indeed, the main concern to use Mathieu equation is whether all solutions are
bounded for given values of the parameters δ and . If all solutions are bounded then the
corresponding point in the δ −  parameter plane is said to be stable. A point is called
unstable if an unbounded solution exists.

   Garira and Bishop [86] analyzed Equation 1.6 for a parametrically excited single
pendulum. The found that the stability of the solution depend on the values of ω and
P . the authors showed in Figure 1.20, that a large region of stability exist when ω is
close to 2. The increase of the parameter P around ω ≈ 2 (region I) generates limit cycle
solutions (gray region) and even chaotic solution if P is high enough.

A double pendulum is a two degrees of freedom system, which can be consisted as a
simple pendulum attached to another simple pendulum (Figure 1.21). A double pendulum
presents rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions and possible
chaotic motions [88].

    Rafat et al. [89] used a square plates double pendulum as an example of distributed
mass pendulum. They showed that chaotic solution can appear at lower energy solutions
compared to a classical concentrated mass double pendulum. The parametric resonance
of a double pendulum is treated by Sartorelli and Lacarbonara [90]. They constructed the
transition curves for the stability and the frequency-response curves using the method of
multiple scales and the results are validated using experimental data.
    Calvao and Penna [91] analyzed numerically the equations of motion of a double
pendulum. They used different integration techniques and compared the results. They also
found that the Lyapunov exponent method can be used to predict chaos easily. The method
is also useful to predict periodic to quasiperiodic and quasiperiodic to chaos transitions.
The quasiperiodic periodic solution of double pendulums is deeply investigated in [92].
    Classical double pendulums, such as those presented in Figure 1.21, have their two
degrees of freedom generally weakly coupled, each pendulum maintains essentially its
own amplitude.         If one needs a strong coupling, the ratio of the two fundamental
frequencies should be one to two.
    Considering that the basic mode is related to the space-fixed pivot (SFP) pendulum,
where the attached body performs a pure translation (or two translations). The frequency
of the fixed pivot pendulum should be one half or double of that the body-fixed pivot
(BFP) pendulum. In fact, when a pendulum is excited by a periodic force, the excitation
frequency should match it is own natural frequency to have resonance. If the force is
directed exactly to the pivot, in this case the resonant frequency is twice that of the
pendulum.
    Nikolaus Rott [93] was the first to investigate a double pendulum where the SFP and
BPF are horizontally aligned (Figure1.22). In this case, one can check that for horizontally
aligned pivots there two possible cases, as mentioned before, and only one pendulum is
oscillating (again two possible cases), the moving pendulum always excites the one at rest
at its resonant frequency, although by a second order force, and this holds for all possible
combinations of cases. Thus, in every case it is to be expected that the pendulum originally
at rest will draw energy from the other, and the possibility exists that finally the process
will reverse itself.
    For the mathematical point of view, to let the leading coupling effects become
quadratic, the two pivots of the pendulum should be aligned in a horizontal line. In this
case Rott [93] considered free oscillations of a double pendulum when the frequency of
a pivot is the double of the other. He studied the nonlinear interaction between the two
pendulum modes, neglecting friction, and also built models of double pendulums in which

     Miles [94] considered parametrically forced and damped oscillations of damped
oscillations of the Rott’s pendulum when ω2 =ω1 (perfect tuning). He used the method of
time-averaged Lagrangian to derive the equations governing the amplitudes and phases of
the two modes and found these equations admit only fixed-point solutions corresponding
to periodic motions of the double pendulum. There are two types of periodic motions,
namely, linear and nonlinear periodic motions. The spectrum of each type of motion
consists of one basic frequency. However, linear periodic motions correspond to two-
mode vibrations. Becker and Miles [95] considered parametric excitations of a perfectly
tuned Rott’s pendulum when Ω ≈ 2ω2 . They found nonlinear periodic, quasiperiodic, and
chaotic motions for certain excitation-parameter values.
     Nayfeh [96] considered the same problem when the two-to-one internal resonance
is not perfectly tuned (ω2 ≈ 2ω1 ). He found that the modulations equations, derived by
using the method of multiple scales, admit periodic solutions besides fixed-point solutions.
As a consequence, he found that the system could exhibit periodically and chaotically
modulated motions besides periodic motions.

1.5.3    ROTATING P ENDULUMS

Rotating motion for pendulums are particular solutions of the inertial mass where the
position is no longer periodic in time but continues to increase as the system is excited. In
1995, Clifford and Bishop [97] analyzed the rotating solutions of a parametrically excited
pendulum. They found that these solutions only exist for forcing amplitude P higher
than a critical value. Garira and Bishop [86] confirmed this results and showed that other
rotating solution can occur where oscillation and rotations are alternated. The direction of
rotation can be constant with an oscillation phase in this case they are known as oscillating

rotating solution (for ω=0.25), or straddling rotating solution if the direction of rotation
is alternated each cycle [86]. Xu et al. [98] confirmed these results using a numerical
approach. They found that the rotating and oscillating rotating solution are present in two
different region of the phase space. Horton et al. [99] introduced coulomb damping to
the same model treated by the previous authors. The model’s parameters are identified
using an experimental approach. Later Horton et al. [100] proposed to replace the pure
parametric excitation with a vertical displacement by an elliptical motion of the pendulum.
They showed that the same solutions exist in the case. Vaziri et al. [101] experimentally
tested the design with wave excitation, they found that it is still possible to obtain rotating
solutions for energy harvesting purposes. Najdecka et al . [102] replaced the single
pendulum by two pendulums having the same rotating axis but with independent angular
positions. They deduced that synchronization of pendulums rotating in antiphase is more
beneficial for energy harvesting applications.



1.6    M ETHODOLOGY AND GENERAL FRAMEWORK

In this work, we propose to exploit the kinetic energy produced by the rotation of a wheel
and convert it through electromagnetic transduction to electrical energy. In fact, as shown
in the previous state of the art, the electromagnetic transduction is the one that produces
the highest energy density for macroscale applications. The pendulum design is the more
suitable in this case to self generate motions due to inertial forces. Even if this kind of
design has been treated previously as energy harvester, we believe that, thanks to its rich
dynamics, it is still worth investigating especially for multibody pendulum, such as the
double pendulum and the Rott’s pendulum.
   The reminder of this thesis will be organized as follows. In Chapter 2, we tackle
directly the design problem using simple concentrated mass approach so that the equation
of motion are easily derived and solved. Based on these results, In Chapter 3, some design
will be tested in a laboratory workbench that emulate the conditions for the rim of a wheel.
In Chapter 4, a deeper analytical and numerical dynamic analysis will be proposed for a
deep understanding of the dynamics of pendulums in rotating wheels. Finally, conclusions
and recommendation for future works will be proposed.

2.1    I NTRODUCTION

The proof of concept on the use of Pendulum-based energy harvester rotating wheels is
tackled in this chapter. Using simple concentrated mass designs to analyze the motion and
the possibility to harvest energy from rotating wheels with variable speeds.
   The number of degree of freedom to be considered in these designs can vary. However,
except the first degree which is restricted to the rotation of the wheel, for convenience the
second one should carry the transducer.
   We start by presenting and deriving equations of motion of four designs that are taken
into study in the transient behavior : Simple pendulum with parallel axis, double pendulum
with parallel axes, simple pendulum with non-parallel axis and Rott’s pendulum.
   In the second part of this chapter we compare different designs in the time domain.
Starting by calculating the time response and the RMS value of the angular velocity for
each design.

In this section several designs are proposed to convert the motion of the wheel into a
suitable rotation for the transducer using one or several pendulums. The transducer is
supposed to be a purely resistive electric generator easily modeled by viscous damping
term [55] in the equation of motion of the energy harvester. The proposed designs are

case of double pendulum with parallel axes, the Rott’s pendulum, is also taken as a case
of study.
     The designs to be considered have in common the first degree of freedom to models
the rotating wheel. It is composed of a disk representing the wheel of center O, mass m0 ,
rotating about an axis (O, ~z0 ) of an inertial frame (O0 , ~x0 , ~y0 , ~z0 ) and a local coordinate
(O, ~x0 , ~y0 , ~z0 ) with a translation relatively to the Galilean reference (O0 , ~x0 , ~y0 , ~z0 ). A
rod is attached to the perimeter of the disk according to its radial direction along the axis
(O, ~x1 ). In this chapter we consider the case of a standard car wheel with dimensions
195/65 R15.
   The vehicle is supposed to be initially at rest and accelerating until reaching a cruising
                                −−→
speed in few seconds. Assuming OO0 = x0 (t)~x0 giving the position of center of the wheel
with respect to the inertial frame.
     We suppose that the variation of the speed of the vehicle is following the relation

2.1 are compared with experimental data taken from a real car. The speed velocity shown
are measured using GPS data from a smart phone.

rigid massless rod and a mass m concentrated at point M , free to rotate about a revolute
joint with axis (A, ~z0 ). The angle α locate the mass position with respect to the first rod
(see Figure 2.2).
   We define a local frame (A, ~x2 , ~y2 , ~z0 ), attached to the pendulum. Assuming that OA =
R and AM = r, gives the following position vector of the mass m:

2.2.2    D OUBLE PENDULUM DESIGN WITH PARALLEL AXES

The proposed double pendulum design is obtained by adding an additional revolute joint to
the previous design so that the position of the mass m is parameterized using two angles
α and β. The design is shown in Figure 2.3. All axes of rotation are parallel and the
transducer is still located at the first revolute joint in point A.

    We define an additional frame (B, ~x3 , ~y3 , ~z0 ), attached to the mass and parameterized
by the angle β. Assuming that OA = R and AB = BM = 2r , gives the following position
vector of the mass m:

2.2.4      ROTT ’ S PENDULUM WITH PARALLEL AXIS

Another interesting design can be included here is the well known Rott pendulum [93].
The pendulum is known to be an autoparametric system with two DOF in which one of
the frequencies is exactly the double of the other one. For simplification we model the
pendulum by two concentrated masses attached to two rods as shown in Figure 2.5.
   Rott pendulum should have some specific properties: first, the pivots of the two
pendulums are horizontal when the system is in stable equilibrium.              Also, the first
pendulum has exactly a period equal to twice that of the second pendulum. This makes it
very easy to transfer energy from one pendulum to another, since their oscillations coincide
in both periods.

and symmetric, the position vectors of the two masses in M1 and M2 are described as
follows:

   To convert the kinetic energy into electrical energy, it is proposed to use an
electromagnetic transduction element. So that the harvested energy is proportional to the
angular velocity at the first DOF of the pendulum, i.e. α̇.
   In the following sections, we propose to solve the derived nonlinear equations of
motions for the proposed pendulums with a time domain analysis using a Runge-Kutta
discretization technique. The time response of the different design will be analyzed along
with the variation of the angular velocity α̇ when the vehicle is accelerated from rest
position to the cruising speed according to the curve presented in Figure 2.1 and Equation

2.3.1   T IME RESPONSE OF THE SIMPLE PENDULUM WITH PARALLEL AXIS

The pendulum described in Figure 2.2 and described by Equation 2.8 is treated by
numerically solving its equation of motion in time using angular position corresponding
to the initial configuration where θ(0) = 0 and α(0) = − π2 and α̇(0) = 0. The results
are presented in Figure 2.6 for the angular position α of the transducer axis when its is
subject to different damping coefficients (c = 0.01, c = 0.05, c = 0.2 and c = 0.5) and
V0 = 50km/h. Since electromagnetic transducer are sought we are also interested in the
time response of the angular velocity α̇. It is shown in Figure 2.7. In both figures, the
time is represented by the number of rotations of the wheel. As expected, the lower the
damping coefficient the higher oscillations are. For the angular velocity it is anticipated
that the blue curve for c = 0.01 will gives the highest harvested energy.
   Also, since the transient response is of paramount importance in this case, the initial

to ts = 20s corresponding to 111.67 rotations of the wheel.
     The trajectory of the mass point M in the frame (A, ~x1 , ~y1 , ~z0 ) for a damping coefficient
c = 0.01 and α(0) = − π2 is shown in Figure 2.8. The trajectory is a fourth circle because it
starts from the position α(0) = − π2 and ends with small oscillations around the equilibrium
position generated because of the centrifugal forces at α(0) = 0.
     Using Equation 2.24 we calculate the RMS values of the angular velocity for different
damping coefficients whose time response is given by 2.7 for α(0) = 0. The results are

coefficient c = 0.01 and different initial conditions α(0). As shown, the maximum value of
the α̇RM S is obtained for α(0) = π at 0.65, which is the value giving the largest amplitude.
However, since the initial angle is arbitrary it cannot be treated as a design parameter.


2.3.2    T IME RESPONSE OF THE DOUBLE PENDULUM WITH PARALLEL AXIS

For the double pendulum, a additional DOF is added, as shown in Figure 2.3, the
transducer is still mounted at the first DOF, therefore we are still interested in this case
to the variation of α(t) with respect to the wheel position θ(t).
     The time response of α(t) is presented in Figure 2.10 when α(0) = − π2 and β(0) =
0. It is shown that the response is qualitatively very similar to the first design with a
single pendulum. Also the variation of the angular velocity α̇(t) with respect to the wheel
position is shown in Figure 2.11. Here, even if the response is similar to the first case, the
observed peak amplitudes are lower in this case.
     The trajectory of the point mass M is, in this case, more sophisticated because of the
additional DOF. The trajectory shown in Figure 2.12 first circular around the point B,
then, as the solution tend to reach the steady state, the double beam design with its two
DOF stretches out and behaves as it is only with one DOF, under the strong effect of the
centrifugal force.

     Similarly to the previous design we use Equation 2.24 to calculate the RMS values of

second one with double pendulum.

pendulum in terms of RMS value of the angular velocity. In Figure 2.13 the maximum
RMS value is 0.524 at α(0) = π

2.3.3    T IME RESPONSE OF THE SIMPLE PENDULUM WITH NON - PARALLEL AXIS


For the pendulum with non-parallel axis described by Figure 2.4, we analyze the time
response of the system by fixing the value of the geometric angle α to a predefined value
and solve for the time response of β where the transducer is located.

     For the case where the initial conditions are α = 0 and β(0) = − π2 , we plot the results
shown in Figures 2.15 and 2.16 for, respectively, the angular position β(t) and angular
velocity β̇(t). The figures demonstrate that the angle β(t) tend to converge toward the
value −π at the steady state. For the duration of the simulation, fixed for all cases at 20s,
only the response for c = 0.01 reaches this value. As a result the angular velocities depict
high oscillations for the case where c = 0.01. For the other cases only small variations are
observed. For all cases, the angular velocity tends to stabilize to a periodic solution due to
the effect of the gravity on the mass.

     The results shown in Figure 2.19 depict the variation of β̇RM S as we vary the initial
condition β(0). Two peaks are observed corresponding to the values of initial condition
β(0) = 0.23 × 2π and β(0) = 0.77 × 2π. On the other hand, the maximum reached value
is very low when compared to the RMS value obtained for the single pendulum design.

RMS value β̇RM S . We compute this variation and plot the results in Figure 2.20. It is
shown that a maximum RMS value is obtained for α = 0.23 × 2π.
     Next, we vary both angular position α and β(0) in order to detect the positions that
maximize the value of β̇RM S . This is shown in Figure 2.21. We remark that the maximum

2.3.4    T IME RESPONSE OF THE ROTT ’ S PENDULUM WITH PARALLEL AXIS

The last proposed design is the Rott’s pendulum, where two degree of freedom should
be solved. It is described by Figure 2.5. We analyze the time response of the system
where we suppose that the transducer is located at the axis (A, ~z0 ). Therefore the damping
coefficient c2 = 0.0001 is fixed for all simulations. The initial conditions are α = − π2 and
β(0) = 0.
     In Figure 2.22, the time response of the angular position α(t) is shown for a duration
of 20s simulation and by keeping the cruising speed to 50km/h. The behavior is similar to
the previous cases where the influence of the damping coefficient is clearly restricting the
rotations. This is confirmed in Figure 2.23 where the angular velocity β̇(t) variation with
respect to the wheel angular position is showed for the several damping coefficients c1 .
     Also, the trajectory of the mass point M in the frame (A, ~x1 , ~y1 , ~z0 ), for a damping
coefficient c = 0.01, α(0) = − π2 and β(0) = 0, is shown in Figure 2.24. The trajectory
is oscillating during the transient response due to the presence of the additional degree of
freedom.
     The RMS value of the angular velocity α̇RM S is estimated for initial conditions β(0) =
0 and by varying α(0), when the damping coefficient is fixed to c1 = 0.01. The results,
shown in Figure 2.25 depicts a maximum value of α̇RM S at α(0) = π.

2.4     R ESULTS DISCUSSION

The results simulated in the previous section gives a clear idea about the performances of
the different proposed design for a transient behavior. In fact, the transduction mechanism,
proposed here is an rotating electromagnetic generator, that produces electrical energy
proportionally to the angular speed of its axis. Therefore, the method proposed to compare
between the performances of the different proposed designs is to calculate an RMS value
of the angular velocity of the concerned degree of freedom and compare the outcomes.
The RMS depends on the initial conditions α(0) and β(0). In Table 2.5 we summarize the
RMS values obtained for different designs and their corresponding initial conditions.
     The simple pendulum with parallel axes presents the maximum RMS value. This can
be explicated by the fact that we consider a damping coefficient in each degree of freedom.
The simple pendulum, as a single degree of freedom system gives best results.
Results show also that the double pendulum gave a better RMS value than the Rott’s
pendulum.

wheel. The equation of motion of each design in transient behavior were derived. Next,
the time response of the angular position and angular velocity were calculated for different
damping coefficients.

The trajectory of the point mass of each pendulum were also calculated in addition of the

   We notice that the RMS value depends on the initial conditions and it reaches its
highest value for a simple pendulum with parallel axis when α(0) = π.

3.1     I NTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we will put into experiment three pendulum designs: simple pendulum,
double pendulum and Rott’s pendulum. We start by characterizing the electromagnetic
generator in which the pendulums will be linked.
   As a first step, we derive the governing equation of the generator to get the torque
developed at the generator’s shaft and the generated power. Then we look at the optimum
load resistance by measuring the higher power from generated voltage and current.
   Then, we will proceed to the setup and characterization of each pendulum. We use a
test bench setup to reproduce the behavior of the pendulum mounted into a rotating disk.
Steady-state and transient behaviors will be tested and the output voltage will be measured
at each case.

output "Portescap 16N78 Athlonix" with precious metal commutation with a coreless

3.2.2   C HARACTERIZATION ASSEMBLY

To characterize the Portescap DC motor in generator mode, we couple two motors by
connecting the shafts through an elastic link (see Figure 3.1). The first DC motor will be
used as the drive motor and it will rotate the second motor which will be considered as the
generator.
   The characterization assembly is wired as follows: first the drive motor is linked to
voltage generator to control its rotation speed ωm . The input voltage Ui and current Ii
are measured at the drive motor connectors (Figure 3.2). The output connectors of the
generator are first linked to a variable resistance decade box that will allow the variation
of the resistance load, then, the output voltage Uo is measured across this resistance load
and the output current Io is the one crossing it (Figure 3.2). The output speed of the drive

     The objective of the characterization assembly, presented here, is to characterize the
generator by measuring the electromechanical coupling coefficient relating the rotation
speed to electromotive force known as the EMF-constant KE and the torque constant KT ,
relating the generated current to the applied torque.

     The proposed characterization assembly of the generator is modeled by the following
differential equation derived using the Kirchhoff’s voltage law (mesh rule):

where R is the value of the variable load resistance, RG is the internal resistance of the
generator, Io is the generated current, LG is the generator inductance and Eemf is the
electromotive force of the generator.
     The proposed generator is a permanent magnet DC motor, it is rotating at constant
speed thanks to the drive motor fed at constant voltage Ui . As a result, the electrical
current flowing through the electrical circuit of the generator Io is constant (Figure 3.2).
The Equation (3.1) becomes

                                    (R + RG )Io − Eemf = 0                                   (3.2)

     We use the Ohm’s law across the resistance load R, where the output voltage is Uo ,
that is

   The electromotive force of the generator is deduced by
                                                  RG

   On the other hand we adopt the classical electromechanical coupling equations for
permanent magnet DC motors [104] given by

                                      Eemf = KE ωm                                      (3.6)

where the rotation speed ωm and the torque Tm are both transmitted by the drive motor. KE
is the EMF-constant and KT is the torque constant. Therefore, we deduce from Equation
3.4 that
                                        RG Uo        RG
                           KE = (1 +      )   = (1 +    )Kω                             (3.8)

where Kω =     ωm
                    is a constant ratio factor if the resistance load R is fixed. It will be
identified latter in the experimental characterization of the generator.
   The input power for the generator is Pin = Tm ωm , while the generated power is
P = Uo Io , which is the power dissipated in the resistance load. Therefore the electrical
efficiency η of the generator can be defined by letting

                                         P = ηPin                                       (3.9)

   If we consider Equations (3.3), (3.7) and (3.9), we can estimate the torque constant by
                                                Kω
                                         KT =                                          (3.10)
                                                η
   As a result, we deduce the torque as a function of the rotation speed as follows:

                                                 Uo  K2
                             Tm = KT Io = Kω        = ω ωm                             (3.11)

   The torque developed at the generator’s shaft is proportional to the rotation speed of
the shaft. Also we can calculate the proportionality between the generated electrical power
and rotation speed since this later will be induced by the pendulum in motion. Using the
same equations we deduce that

                                                          Kω2 2
                              P = ηPin = ηTm ωm =            ω                         (3.12)

   The generated power is proportional to the square of the rotation speed. This result
will be confirmed in the following characterization section.

The generator is supposed to transduce mechanical energy to electrical power under certain
working conditions. In this work, without loosing the generality of the approach, we
are supposing that the load circuit can be modeled as purely resistive. However, the
efficiency of the transduction is highly dependent on the impedance matching between
the mechanical and electrical domains of the generator. For this reason we will try first
to determine the optimal resistance load Ropt that allow maximum conversion of the
mechanical work into electrical power. Is is worth noting here that the internal resistance
of the generator was measured at RG = 63.4Ω.
     For a fixed rotation speed ωm , we measure Uo and Io for different values of the load
resistance R, then we calculate the generated electrical power by assuming that it is equal
to the electrical power dissipated into the resistance load.

     In the Figure 3.4, we plot the curves of Io and Uo for a load resistance R varying from
10 to 107 Ω, for ωm = 1000rpm and ωm = 2000rpm. We notice that Io decreases when R
increases. In the other hand, Uo increases when R increases until it reaches a saturation
level. The same shapes are observed for different rotation speeds.
     Plotting the curve of the transduced power P as R is varied in the Figure 3.5 for
different rotation speeds, we notice that P reaches its optimum value for the same value

   At optimal load resistance, we plot in Figure 3.6 the output voltage Uo , and current Io
versus the rotation speed ωm . We notice that Uo has a linear variation with the rotation
speed ωm . We deduce that the slope in Figure 3.6 can be identified with the ratio factor

   The relation relating the applied torque by the drive motor and the rotation speed, given
by Equation (3.11) is used to derive the equation of motion of the pendulum. It states that
the torque at the generator is proportional to the rotation speed which appear as a damping
term in the pendulum equation of motion as used in the previous chapter.
   The generated electrical power P and the torque developed at the generator’s shaft Tm
are measured as we increase the rotation speed of the drive motor when optimal resistance
is used. The plot shown in Figure 3.7 shows a net increase of the power as the rotation
speed increases. The output power is fitted to the function f (ωm ) = 4.16 × 10−5 ωm
                                                                                   2

Figure 3.7. This result confirms the one deduced in Equation 3.12 that the generated power
is proportional to the square of the rotation speed.
Furthermore, the plot shows that the torque is proportional to the rotation speed as
demonstrated in Equation 3.11.

3.3.1   P RESENTATION OF P ENDULUMS

In this section, we will characterize three types of pendulums selected to be used in
this thesis: the simple pendulum, the double pendulum and the Rott’s pendulum. The
non-parallel axis pendulum is dropped for fabrication difficulty reasons. The choice of
the dimensions of the pendulums is related to the availability of fabrication facilities
in FEMTO-ST applied mechanics department. Nevertheless, we tried to minimize the
dimensions of the pendulum, in general, to be consistent with their field of application in
the TPMS context. Steel was chosen as a material for the fabrication of all pendulums.


3.3.2   S ETUP OF THE STUDIED PENDULUMS

The three pendulums are fabricated using classical fabrication techniques such as milling
and turning. The revolute joint are realized using deep groove double ball-bearings used
as open bearings (without seals or shields) in order to reduce damping.
   The pendulums are mounted into an aluminum support (Figure 3.8), where a double
roll bearing is mounted to link the different pendulums to be tested with the generator.




                          Figure 3.8: Setup of the studied pendulums


   To measure the natural frequencies of each pendulum, we use a laser vibrometer
Polytec PDV100 directed toward the movable parts that needs to be characterized. The
natural frequencies will also depend on the inertial characteristics of the generator and the
electrical load attached to it. Thus, resonance frequencies of the pendulum were measured

For the simple pendulum it is made of a steel rod with rectangular cross-section and total
dimensions 47×13×4mm. The rod is mounted on the output shaft linked to the generator,
see Figure 3.9.

     To measure the natural frequency of the single pendulum, we made a free release
of the rod with initial position, then we measured its oscillation frequency using a laser
vibrometer oriented to the rod tip.
     In the ideal case, the added tip mass do not changes the resonance frequency if its
moment of inertia is negligible. However, in our case, the mass is distributed and due
to the relatively small dimensions of the system, linking an additional mass to the rod
changes the natural frequency of the pendulum. So we consider three cases: first, when no
mass is attached to the rod, second when two different masses are attached to the rod.
     The Table 3.2 presents the resonance frequencies of the simple pendulum with different
values of the tip mass. The generator is connected in all cases to the optimal electrical
resistance load. As seen in Table 3.2, the natural frequency of the simple pendulum is
reduced by increasing the value of the tip mass.

The double pendulum considered in this case of study, is composed of two rods of the
same length (Figure 3.10). Each rod is also equal in length to the one used in the simple
pendulum case. The rods are linked through a pivot joint bearings that ensure the rotation
function. In this case the double pendulum is a 2 DOF system with two natural frequencies.

   It turns out that the resonance frequency of the rod mounted on the shaft of the
generator will be the same as the simple pendulum presented in Table 3.2. Yet, we have
to measure the resonance frequency of the second rod which is attached to the first one.
The values of the natural frequency is measured using a laser vibrometer. They are given
in Table 3.3 where different tip masses are attached to the second rod. In this case an
electrical optimal load resistance have been used. As denoted in the case of the simple
pendulum, the natural frequency decreases as the value of the tip mass increase.

3.3.2.3   ROTT ’ S P ENDULUM

As specified in the previous chapter, a Rott’s pendulum is a 2 DOF pendulum in which the
natural frequency ratio between each of its DOF is equals to 2. This particular frequency
ratio induce a two-to-one internal resonance with a principal parametric resonance [96].
The design is inspired by the one proposed by Rott in 1970 [93].
     Particularly in the proposed design we tried to be consistent with the previous cases. As
demonstrated in the preceding sections, the designed small scale system is very sensitive
to the geometry of the pendulum. Several attempts were required to finally get the right
masses to be used in order to get the right frequency ratio.
     Assuming that Rod 1 is the L-rod mounted to the shaft of the generator and Rod 2 is
the one mounted into Rod 1. According to Rott [93], the frequencies that should have a
ratio equal to 2 are those related to the natural frequency of Rod 2 and the other one should
be the natural frequency of Rod 1 in which the total mass of Rod 2 is linked to the second
pivot location as a concentrated mass. The proposed design of the Rott pendulum is shown
in Figure 3.11.

In this section, we expose the proposed design of the test bench that emulate the behavior
of the wheel in order to put the pendulum in conditions that are similar to real case wheel’s
car. The main idea behind this design is to simulate the rotation of the car’s wheel and more
specifically its rim, in which our pendulums are attached.
     Most of the commercial personal vehicles are equipped with 15” (381mm) or 16”
(406mm) rims. In our work, we put into rotation a disk which is assimilated to a rim,
presented in Figure 3.14. The disk made of Polyoxymethylene (POM), is characterized by
its high strength and light weight. It is equipped with large grooves allowing to mount the
generator in several positions and radii.

     Several rotation speeds and rotation regimes (accelerations and decelerations) needs
to be tested. Therefore, a total control of the speed is offered in the proposed design.
Also, since the main objective of this work is to estimate the electrical energy that can be
harvested by the proposed systems, we also need to measure the generated voltage at the
rotating pendulum. A slip ring brush system is used to connect the rotating wires to the
acquisition unit.
     The whole test bench is presented in Figure 3.15. The nomenclature of the test bench
is presented hereafter: 1-Electric motor, 2-Rotating shaft, 3-Plain bearings, 4-Mount for
two slip ring brush holders, 5-Hub, 6-Universal joints, 7-Spacer ring, 8-Slip ring (HBM
SK5), 9-Disk.
     The speed variation of the motor is ensured by a variable speed drive (Leroy Somer
Digidrive SK) which is controlled by PC via a DAS (Data Acquisition System, DSP siglab
20-42). The DAS offers several input functions to be interpreted by the variable speed

3.5     E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS AND VALIDATION


In this section we will put into experience, the three different pendulums studied in
the previous chapters and verify experimentally their performances. Each pendulum is
mounted to the support and linked to the generator. The support is fixed to the rotating
disk which is actuated by the test bench.
     Two approaches can be treated here: the transient and the steady state regimes. In
fact, energy can be harvested in both regimes, depending on the kind of vehicle intended
to be equipped, one or the other can be dominant. Practically, for the case at hand in the
test bench, the analyzed regime is depending on the chosen input function at the DAS
level to rotate the disk, one of these regimes will be treated. For example, for constant
functions, the response of the disk will be a constant speed rotation and a steady state
response is quickly achieved, especially for the simple pendulum. On the other hand, if a
periodic function is assumed to be the input, the transient behavior of the pendulum will
be dominant.
     In all cases, the generator is connected to the DAS, through the slip ring, to measure
the electrical response generated by each type of pendulum.
     The car wheel taken in our case of study has dimensions 195/65 R15. The external
diameter of the tire is 620mm. As presented in chapter 3, we consider that the vehicle
reaches a speed equals to 50km/h, this means that the angular velocity is equal to 418rpm.
Thus in our test bench, the speed variation will be taken from 0 to 418rpm. The electrical
resistance load is fixed at its optimal value R=Ropt =59Ω.

3.5.1     T EST AT CONSTANT ANGULAR ROTATION OF THE RIM



In this section we will plot the solution of the steady-state behavior, generated at constant
angular velocity for different rotation speeds, of each studied pendulum. The voltage
Vin given by the variable speed drive is transformed to an angular velocity ω. For each
pendulum, we measure the maximum and minimum peaks generated voltage Vout(max)
and the minimum generated voltage Vout(min) . The amplitude of the generated voltage is
∆Vout = Vout(max) − Vout(min) .

   Depending on the value of the rotation speed ω, several observations concerning the
behavior of the pendulum can be made. If the pendulum is oscillating around the vertical
axis (gravity axis), meaning that the weight force is dominant over the inertial forces. This
situation is marked by SV. If ω is high enough, the centrifugal forces dominate the gravity
forces and the pendulum is now oscillating around the radial axis of the rotating disk. This
situation is marked by SR. Between these two responses a transition behavior is observed
where the pendulum is swinging between the SV and SR solutions. As a result, for the
steady state behavior, the response is aperiodic. This situation is marked by AP.

In this section, we put into experiment a simple pendulum fixed on the generator with a
mass equals to 5.8g mounted at the free tip of the rotating rod.

   In Table 3.5 we show measurements loaded for different rotation speeds of the disk.
We notice that, for ω less than 69.5rpm, the behavior is observed to be at the SV type and
the amplitude of maximum voltage is proportional to ω. For a rotation speed 69.5rpm,
the amplitude of generated voltage rises to reach a maximum value equals to 0.64V.
The corresponding time depend output voltage is shown in Figure 3.18. For ω higher
than 70rpm, the simple pendulum oscillates around the radial axis and ∆Vout falls and
continue to decrease when ω increases. The behavior is observed to be at the SR regime
as confirmed by Figure 3.19.

For the double pendulum, we put into experiment the device shown in Figure 3.10 with a
mass equals to 5.8g mounted on the tip of the free rod. In Table 3.6 we show measurements
loaded for different rotation speeds of the disk.

   We notice, in Table 3.6, that for ω less than 58.5rpm, the double pendulum
oscillates around the vertical axis (SV regime) and the amplitude of maximum voltage is
proportional to ω. For the SV regime, an example is given in Figure 3.20 when ω=54rpm.
For a rotation speed going from 58.5rpm to 96rpm, the pendulum is observed to have
aperiodic behavior with the AP regime. It is also observed that ∆Vout increases when ω
increases to reach a peak equals to 1.5V when ω is about 80rpm. An example is given
in Figure 3.21 when ω=89.5rpm. When ω goes higher than 96rpm, the double pendulum
oscillates around the radial axis (SR regime) and ∆Vout falls and continue to decrease
when ω increases. An example is given in Figure 3.22 when ω=96rpm.

For the third proposed experiment, we use the Rott’s pendulum presented in Figure 3.11.
The results summarized in Table 3.7 shows measurements of the output voltage loaded
for different rotation speeds. We notice that, for ω equals to 25rpm, the Rott’s pendulum
oscillates around the vertical axis where the generated voltage is very small. The detailed
time dependent response is shown in Figure 3.23. For a rotation speed going from 46rpm
to 90rpm, oscillations behavior changes to be in the AP regime, ∆Vout increases when
ω increases to reach a peak equals to 1.05V when ω is about 85rpm. The corresponding
time response is reported in Figure 3.24. From ω equals to 90rpm, the Rott’s pendulum
oscillates around the radial axis and ∆Vout falls and continue to decrease when ω increases.
The time response for ω=90rpm is shown in Figure 3.25.

3.5.1.4   C OMPARISON BETWEEN DIFFERENT PENDULUMS BEHAVIORS

From the previously accomplished tests concerned with the three types of pendulums, we
plot in Figure 3.26 the variation of ∆Vout as the rotation speed is increased. We note that
there are similar behaviors between the three pendulums. In fact, ∆Vout increases when
the behavior is in the SV regime. This is due to the fact that, at this regime, the rotation
speed of the pendulum about the disk is equal to the rotation speed of the disc about its
base. As a result the generator is almost driven by the rotation of the disk because the
gravity forces are dominant.
     As the rotation speed is increased the behavior switches to the AP regime and ∆Vout
jumps to higher values thanks to large displacements of the pendulum. The output voltage
amplitude continues to increase as the rotation speed of the disk is increased as shown
in Figure 3.26. It is in this regime that the device is generating the maximum output
power. In fact, at the AP regime, the pendulum is switching between the vertical and radial
positions because the weight force and centrifugal force are comparable. The amplitude
of the motion is expected to be large. In addition, when the rotation speed of the disk
is increased the speed at which this switching is observed is accelerated and the output
voltage is increased consequently.
     As the rotation speed is further increased, the behavior of the pendulum changes to
oscillating around the radial axis (SR). As a result, ∆Vout is reduced and continues to

decrease during SR regime. This is due to the increase of the centrifugal acceleration
which is proportional to the square of the rotational speed of the disk. The switching
between the AP and SR regimes is abrupt and highly reduces the output voltage as
observed in Figure 3.26.

   It is important to note here that the behavior described above is valid essentially for
the double pendulum and the Rott’s pendulum. Concerning the simple pendulum, the
transition between the SV and SR regimes is very small. We observed that the AP regime
is unavailable for the simple pendulum. In fact, in this case the total mass of the pendulum
is small compared to the other two cases and the the inertial forces can quickly take over
the weight force, which eliminates the AP regime for the simple pendulum.
   Also the results described in Figure 3.26 are consistent with those given in Chapter
2 and obtained analytically with punctual masses pendulums. In fact, for the transient
response regime, we demonstrated that the double pendulum is better than the Rott’s
pendulum when they are compared regarding the RMS value of the generated voltage.
   Concerning the steady state solution, we observed that the double pendulum is still
better than the Rott’s pendulum for rotation speeds lower than 300rpm. For higher values,

the Rott’s pendulum seems to generate more voltage. This results should be confirmed by
analytical analysis tackled in the next chapter. In fact, the two-to-one internal resonance
that should improve the Rott’s pendulum results is difficult to realize when the device is
mounted in the rotating disk because the natural frequencies are affected by the applied
centrifugal acceleration which perturb the frequency ratio designed previously.

3.5.2    T EST   UNDER PERIODIC VARIATION OF THE ANGULAR ROTATION OF THE
         DISK

Using a variable input function, we record the transient output voltage generated for
different initial positions of the disk. In fact, as demonstrated is chapter 2, the initial
value describing the position of pendulum is highly correlated to the generated voltage for
transient analysis. For this reason we varied the initial position of the disk before sending
the input function to initiate the rotation.
     The input function is described in Figure 3.27. The function can be described by a half
sine signal varying between the rest position and a maximum rotation speed of the disk.
The acceleration and deceleration phases, from to 0 to 418rpm take 10 seconds, than a rest
phase of 10 seconds is applied (Figure 3.27).

     The initial angular position of the disk, denoted here by the angle θ (presented in Figure
2.3 and Figure 2.5), is set to four specific values: 0, π/2, π and 3π/2. At each one of these
initial conditions the input function is applied and the RMS value of the output voltage
∆Vout is calculated. The experiments were conducted on the double pendulum and Rott’s
pendulum alone since they are the design that are of interesting in this research work.

For the double pendulum design, the output voltage of the generator across the optimal
resistance load Ropt =59Ω are shown in Table 3.8. We confirm here that as demonstrated
in the analytical analysis in Chapter 2 that the initial conditions are a very important factor
concerning the output voltage. It is found that the measured voltage amplitude ∆Vout and
                           RM S
RMS value of the voltage Vout   are maximum when θ = π. More than 50% drop is
observed for these values if the initial condition is set to θ = 0. The time response, shown
in Figure 3.28, for the case θ = π and the rotation speed following the input signal in
Figure 3.27, depicts the response of the double pendulum design in terms of generated
voltage.

    The pendulum response shown in Figure 3.28 shows that the transient behavior
observed during the acceleration phase of the disk generates higher voltages. When the
disk is close to its maximum speed, the pendulum behavior is switched to the SR type
where the centrifugal force is dominant and the amplitude of motion is small. Once the
deceleration phase is started the amplitude of the motion starts increasing because the
steady state motion due to the presence of the centrifugal force is perturbed. When the
disk is stopped, a free vibration motion is observed at the end of the half sine signal.

The Rott’s pendulum design is treated similarly to the double pendulum design with the
input signal in Figure 3.27. The results of the output voltage of the Rott’s pendulum design
are shown in Table 3.9. Again we observe that the initial condition corresponding to θ = π
gives the maximum output amplitude voltage and RMS value. Also an important drop of
these values is noticed for other initial conditions. The time response corresponding to the
output voltage for θ = π is shown in Figure 3.29. Here the time response is similar to the
one observed in the previous case.

3.6    C ONCLUSION


In this chapter, we putted into experiment three pendulum designs: simple pendulum,
double pendulum and Rott’s pendulum.                      The electromagnetic generator in which
pendulums were mounted was characterized independently. The torque developed at the
generator’s shaft and the generated power were estimated using a direct driving method.
We found that the generated torque is proportional to the rotation speed of the shaft. This
proportionality was also validated experimentally.
    The optimum load resistance for power output of the generator was measured equal to
59 Ohms. The resonance frequency of each pendulum was also measured by the mean of
laser vibrometer.
    The test bench which simulates the behavior of a car rim was designed and fabricated.
The solution for the steady-state behavior of each pendulum, generated at angular velocity
for different rotation speeds, was experimentally tested. We noticed that three different
regimes are present: oscillations around the vertical axis, aperiodic oscillations and
oscillations around the radial axis. The aperiodic regime gives better output voltage for
each pendulum and the double pendulum gives the better generated energy.

   Then, a half-sine input function was used to record the transient output voltage
generated for different initial positions of the disk for each pendulum. The RMS value
was calculated. For each pendulum, a better RMS values were measured when θ = π.

For this chapter, an analytical approach is proposed to analyze the behavior of the Rott’s
pendulum design when it is linked to a rotating wheel, under the steady-state regime.
The perturbation technique is used to solve the nonlinear governing equations, in order to
clarify the contribution of the different geometrical and physical parameters on the steady-
state response of the pendulum under constant rotation speed of the wheel.



4.1    P ROBLEM S TATEMENT

Rott described two requirements for his pendulum to be driven by parametric resonance
with a two-to-one internal resonance [93, 96]:
- The line joining the two pivot should be horizontal at equilibrium,
- The natural frequency ratio between the two degree of freedom of the pendulum should
be equal to 2.
   Rott’s pendulum can be decomposed into two pendulums P1 and P2 (Figure 4.1). The
pendulum P1 has a mass m1 , a moment of inertia I1 about the axis (G1 , ~z0 ), where G1 is
its center of gravity. Its rotation about the axis (A, ~z0 ) is parameterized by the angle α.
The pendulum P2 has a mass m2 , a moment of inertia I2 about the axis (G2 , ~z0 ), where G2
is its center of gravity. Its rotation about the axis (B, ~z0 ) is parameterized by the angle β.
   In order to satisfy the first requirement for the design of the Rott’s pendulum it is
imposed that the center of gravity of the whole system at equilibrium, denoted by G,
should be located along the axis (A, ~x1 ).

   It is expected that starting from a certain rotation speeds, a radial equilibrium position
can be reached and steady state oscillations can be observed around this radial position.
The equilibrium position is reached when α = 0 and β = 0. At this configuration, we
define the inertial properties of the pendulum.
   For simplification, and following Rott [93], we define an hypothetical pendulum,
denoted by P1∗ , composed by P1 in addition to the mass of P2 concentrated in B. The
center of mass of this pendulum at equilibrium belongs to axis (A, ~x1 ) at a distance a.
Therefore, using the barycentric properties of center of mass G of P1∗ , given by

where α0 and α0 are the equilibrium positions that will be determined.
       To determine the equilibrium position, we ignore the gravity effect in Equation 4.12
and 4.13 and also suppose that a steady state is reached, that is η1 = 0 and η2 = 0. We end
up with the following relations that define the equilibrium angles of the pendulums P1 and
P2 .

It is worth noting here that these angles are independent of the rotation speed, they only
depend on the geometry, this is due to radial form of the inertial force field.

   Equations 4.21 and 4.22 are consistent with those derived by Nayfeh [96] when the
rotation of the wheel is stopped (θ̇ = 0) at position θ = − π2 and α0 = β0 = 0. They depict
a quadratic nonlinearity terms with a possibly principal parametric excitations around
both modes. Since the natural frequencies of the pendulum in this configuration are both
proportional to θ̇ (Equation 4.20), the variation of the speed of the wheel will not affect
the resonance condition, whether is it principal or parametric.

    In this chapter we are interested in analyzing the case where the rotation of the wheel
initiate a parametric resonance of the second mode meaning that the rotation speed is close

Using σ1 and σ2 as detuning parameters, we assume that the frequencies ω2 and θ̇ can be
written as

    Replacing Equation 4.38 into Equations 4.36 and 4.37 and keeping in mind that

                       ω2 T0 = 2ω1 T0 + σ1 T1 and θ̇T0 = 2ω2 T0 + σ2 T1

    We aim at eliminating quantities that generate secular terms and small divisor terms
depending on the resonant conditions, for the solution of Equations 4.36 and 4.37.
Therefore, the solvability conditions for these equations are given by:

   Using the amplitude defined in Equation 4.42 into Equations 4.39 and 4.40, equating
real and imaginary parts, we end up with the modulation equations given by:

4.4.2.2   L ARGE RADIAL POSITIONS OF THE PENDULUM

A special case of these equations can be treated analytically if the equilibrium positions
are small compared to the angular amplitude (α0 ≈ 0 and β0 ≈ 0). This is possible if
the radius R at which the pendulum is mounted is large enough. At these conditions, the
constant sine and cosine terms are replaced by 0 and 1 respectively. We end up with the
following reduced modulation equations:

   The resonance conditions are independent on the rotation speed θ̇ of the wheel, as
demonstrated in Equations 4.20 and 4.23. We start by calculating the response of the
pendulum while the rotation speed is varied.



4.6.1    I NFLUENCE OF THE ROTATION SPEED : F ORCE RESPONSE OF THE DEVICE

The rotation speed is directly proportional to the natural frequencies of the Rott’s
pendulum as shown in Equation 4.20. As a result, the parametric resonance condition
θ̇ = 2ω2 is obtained directly by design as it is independent on the choice of the value of θ̇.
As a result, the rotation speed can be freely varied without compromising the parametric
resonance condition and the internal resonance.
   The variation of θ̇ is tested for both designs proposed in Table 4.1. The response
shown in the following subsections section is similar to a force-response analysis indirectly
controlled by the rotation speed. It is estimated here that radial steady state solutions
cannot exist for rotation speeds of the wheel lower than 40 rad/s.

The first proposed design corresponds to the large radial positions of the Rott’s pendulum.
For this design the specific position is chosen so that the parametric resonance and the
internal resonance conditions are both systematically satisfied. Different values of the
detuning parameters σ1 and σ2 are tested here.
   In Figure 4.2, the response amplitudes a1 and a2 are plotted versus the rotation speed
for the case σ1 = 0 and different values of σ2 . As shown, the solution is dominated by the
amplitude a2 corresponding to the motion of pendulum P2 . The motion of pendulum P1
is of interest in our case because it is directly related to the energy generation. Figure 4.2
shows that for certain values of the rotation speed the energy of the system is completely
transferred to the pendulum P2 , which is not suitable to our application. In this figure
dashed curves indicate unstable solutions, while solid curves indicate stable ones.

   In Figure 4.7 it is shown that the amplitude a1 is only nonzero for small values of σ2 .
Here, σ1 = −1 and θ̇ = 55 rad/s. One can conclude that the major part of the energy is
transferred to the amplitude a2 .

For the second design, the detuning parameters are also varied so that their influence is
determined over the amplitude of the responses. In Figure 4.9, σ2 is varied when σ1 = 0.1
and θ̇ = 55 rad/s. The figure depicts clearly that for negative values of σ2 smaller than −2,
a set of stable solution exist where the amplitude a1 is higher than a2 . This is not the case
of Design 1 where the amplitude a2 is always higher.

    In Figure 4.10, we try to increase the value of σ1 and keep the same rotation speed. As
shown, the stable set of solution is still visible for negative values of σ2 . Also in this case
the amplitude a1 is higher than a2 , even if its value is lowered compared to the previous
case.
    Concerning the variation of σ1 , two different case are simulated here: first when σ1 = 1
and θ̇ = 55 rad/s, shown in Figure 4.11, and second when σ1 = −3 and θ̇ = 55 rad/s,
shown in Figure 4.12. For Figure 4.11 all solutions are unstable despite the large variation
of σ1 . On the other hand in Figure 4.12, large stable branches are visible for positive as
well as negative values of σ1 . Also in these cases, generally, the obtained amplitudes are
lower than those obtained in Design 1.

G ENERAL C ONCLUSION

In this thesis, we had to design and model a pendulum-based energy harvesting system.
The pendulum, considered to be an exciter for an electric DC generator (electromagnetic
transducer), is used as an energy harvester for Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems, using
the kinetic energy due to the rotation of the wheel as input energy.
   Thus, for a pendulum mounted inside a tire, important centrifugal forces induced due to
the rotation of the rim, constrains the pendulum to a radial fixed position, making it useless
for energy harvesting applications. The challenge was to find the appropriate design and
configuration for such system to be still useful at large broadband rotation speeds.
   We started by presenting and analyzing four pendulum designs: simple pendulum,
double pendulums, simple pendulum with nonparallel axis and Rott’s pendulum, while
they are mounted in a rotating wheel. The equation of motion of each design are derived
and solved numerically. The transient behavior were deduced and the harvested energy
estimated and compared to each other. The time response of the angular position and
angular velocity were calculated for different damping coefficients and initial conditions.
The RMS value of the angular velocity is used to estimate the harvested energy. We had
noticed that the RMS value depends on the initial conditions and it reaches its highest
value for a simple pendulum with parallel axis when the initial condition is the farthest
from the steady state position.
   As a second step, we designed, fabricated and putted into experiment three pendulum
designs: simple pendulum, double pendulum and Rott’s pendulum. The electromagnetic
generator in which pendulums were mounted was characterized independently. The torque
developed at the generator’s shaft and the generated power were estimated using a direct
driving method. We found that the generated torque is proportional to the rotation speed
of the shaft. This proportionality was also validated experimentally. The optimum load
resistance for power output of the generator was measured equal to 59 Ohms. The

resonance frequency of each pendulum was also measured by the mean of laser vibrometer
in order to characterize it.
   The test bench which simulates the behavior of a car rim was designed and fabricated.
The solution for the steady-state behavior of each pendulum, generated at angular velocity
for different rotation speeds, was experimentally tested. We noticed that three different
regimes are present: oscillations around the vertical axis, aperiodic oscillations and
oscillations around the radial axis. The aperiodic regime gives better output voltage for
each pendulum and the double pendulum gives the better generated energy.
   Then, a half-sine input function was used to record the transient output voltage
generated for different initial positions of the disk for each pendulum. The RMS value
was calculated. For each pendulum, a better RMS values were measured when θ = π.
Also in this case of study, the double pendulum gives better results for a majority of the
tested initial conditions.
   Finally, an analytical analysis is proposed to analyze the steady state response under
constant rotation speeds, because it represents a non negligible part of the regime of motion
of the wheels. The method of multiple scales is applied for the equations of motion
governing the motion of the Rott’s pendulum when small oscillations are assumed around
the radial positions. We deduced that, for the two proposed sets of geometrical dimensions,
parametric resonance of the first and second modes while two to one internal resonance
is satisfied can be achieved. in both cases, the analytically derived resonance conditions,
showed that large amplitude of motions can be achieved if a critical value of the rotation
speed is reached. However, if the speed is further increase the amplitude is again highly
reduced. In fact, the treated case is specific to the TPMS case because the rotation speed
in this case is at the same time the frequency excitation force and the amplitude of the
stabilizing force represented here by the centrifugal force.

This dissertation proposed several issues related to energy harvesting in TPMS using
pendulums. It was also shown that key questions remain to be answered:

      • Since it was demonstrated that transient response of the pendulum can represent
       the larger part of the harvested energy from rotating wheels. This issue should be
       investigated for wheels under real utilization conditions in order to understand the
       impact of randomly varying rotation on the performance of the harvester.

   • For steady state behavior a lot of investigation needs to be done to overcome the
     influence of the centrifugal force that drastically reduces the amount of the harvested
     energy. A good idea is may be to consider rotating solutions that can be realized at
     lower speeds and that the solution can survive high rotation speeds under frequency-
     locking phenomena.

   • Other type of pendulums should be investigated where elastic elements can be
     integrated to reinforce the transient response amplitude and increase the harvested
     energy.

   • Some amelioration can be done to the way the rotation of the pendulum is
     transmitted to the generator. For example, a gear train can be used to increase
     the output rotation speed from the pendulum. Also, a freewheel mechanism can
     be added to the rotation to store elastic energy into an helical spring. A releasr
     mechnism is activated once the spring is completely compressed. It was proved that
     such a mechanism reduces energy leakage through damping.
